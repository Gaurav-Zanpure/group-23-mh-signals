I m ashamed of myself why go on I m turning next month but I honestly don t think I m gonna reach I don t have an exact date but I know I ll do it before my birthday July th It really comes down to this I truly hate myself for the things I can t control and the really bad decisions that I ve made in my life thus far I ll start with the things I can t control I started realizing I was different when I around years old That s when my parents told me I was diagnosed with Asperger s Syndrome at an early age They got me therapy right away to help with the meltdowns I was having but that s all it really helped with I ve tried to improve my social skills over the years but I feel like I ve reached a plateau My social skills aren t as bad as they used to be but I haven t been able to get any better It doesn t help that I ve always been introverted even when I was a little kid I ve always been a homebody I hate parties and any other type of social gathering So it should be no surprise that I ve never had a girlfriend kissed or had sex I ve never even asked a girl out Why bother I know that any girl will just think I m a loser anyway because I m boring and only have one hobby My dad has Asperger s as well and I have no fucking clue how he was able to date when he was my age I also have anxiety The only reason I have a job which is only part time is because I work with my dad s friend otherwise I would no work experience at all A couple of weeks ago my uncle told me his friend who owns an auto parts store was hiring which would ve given my more hours than I have now and I was basically guaranteed the job if I wanted it but I couldn t bring myself to apply for it because I was so worried about all of the potential things that could go wrong if I started working there Now for the bad decisions My parents didn t want to send me to public school in fear that I would be bullied all of the time because of my Asperger s so they decided that I should do cyber school instead Here s where the bad decision comes in I found out that all of the answers for my assignments quizzes and exams for every class were only a Google search away I ended up cheating in all of my classes for all four years of school and graduated in as a cheater I never told me parents When I went to take the SAT I scored around That s when I realized how fucked I was To this day my parents still believe the reason I did so bad on it was because I m just not good at taking standardized tests I obviously wasn t accepted to any universities so I had to go to community college I lasted two semesters only completing out of classes Then I made bad decision dropping out in I wish I was a different person A person with out Asperger s or anxiety I person who didn t cheat in high school I ve realized that I ll never be normal Whenever my dad sees me he smiles like he s happy to see more or something I don t know why I m just a burden and I always will be Why should I bother continuing to live when everyday for the past years I ve woken up wishing I was a different person Medication didn t work Therapy over the last couple of years didn t work There s only one option left and it s sitting in a cabinet feet away from me for when I get the guts to use it It s scary knowing that I have the ability to end my life at any moment If only my father knew what I was thinking then maybe he would actually hide the cabinet key instead of putting it on the counter Tl dr Dianosed with Asperger s have bad social skills introverted boring never had a girlfriend anxiety cheated all throughout high school not smart enough for college wish I was a normal year old and don t know why I should continue living,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

 TLDR at bottom with quotes from article.
 
 —-
 
 I can’t sleep, so I’ve been laying in bed contemplating my mental health and doing cell phone research. Anyway, came across this article that was REALLY interesting to me.
 
 I’ve never been tested for autism, but I’ve suspected most my life, never tested because parents didn’t see it and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then several years later the diagnosis was corrected to bpd, and I just put it off as okay bpd has similar things that’s all it is.
 
 However, my wife and I both have bpd and we’ve been comparing thought processes and talking about mental health a lot lately. And while we’re similar, we differ in a lot of ways. There’s a huge part of my behavior she still can’t understand when it comes to understanding what’s appropriate in certain interactions or in the often completely different ways I interpret situations. It brought me back to thinking maybe it is something more than JUST bpd, so yeah… the googling.
 
 I put the article at the top and I’ll put it [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590952/#!po=1.02041) as well.
 
 
 Basically I’m not crazy… 
 
 TLDR: I’ll sum it up with some quotes from the study:
 
 “…some females with BPD have undiagnosed ASC, due to ASC not being easily detected in females.”
 
 “Recent research is focusing on the possible under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis of ASC in females [40,41], on the assumption that females may experience greater societal pressure to conform and be part of a peer group and so are more motivated to learn how to hide their autism (so-called “camouflaging”) and thereby go “under the radar” of clinicians or school psychologists, by “pretending to be normal” [42]. This may lead to them either receiving their ASC diagnosis far later than males, and/or being diagnosed with other conditions (anorexia, depression, anxiety, or BPD) because clinicians are not looking for how ASC may present itself differently in females.”
 
 “…found that 6 out of 41 BPD patients fulfilled criteria for ASC.”
 
 “Our findings highlight the need for careful examination for autistic traits in patients referred for an assessment for BPD, especially in those without a history of significant childhood abuse or neglect. Some of these patients may have been misdiagnosed (their ASC was overlooked), and a proportion of them may have both conditions.”
 
 
 To put it short….
 
 Def going to talk to my psych MD about if I can be tested for autism now. Holy crap this article made every thing about me make so much more sense! Now I’m wide awake too! I mean, last thing I need is ANOTHER diagnosis to add to the pile, but if it helps it helps! So much for research articles putting people to sleep.""",['Positive Coping'],low

I don t know how to carry on right nowIm living in the UK A small background of my health conditions just to give some context bipolar disorder type severe anxiety obsessive compulsive disorder which I ll explain a little emotionally unstable personality disorder hyper mobility syndrome ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder My diagnoses mean that I really don t and cannot function normally I did for so long forcing everything into a bulging box taping it shut and hiding it under the bed Then I got made redundant from a job that I enjoyed and was good at Very good at It was a call centre admittedly but I really enjoyed it I made some brilliant friends including someone that ended up being my best man and I really do consider him a very good friend Through him I have met other friends plus someone who understands the shit that I am going through I ended up having to take a job that sucked A lot It was the beginning of the opening of that box It was slowly being pulled out from under the bed I was treated like shit I had no sick pay so when I needed the time off when I was having a bad MH day I was financially fucked I was working full time looking after my wife and we struggled a lot Not as bad as some but my god it was hard The job was complicated and my MH which we later worked out was my ADHD just compounded matters greatly I ended up getting another job HUZZAH It was in insurance which is something that I had done at my old job Private office Nice little family run business Annnnnnnnnnnd that s where we hit the snag I wasn t very good I wasn t expecting myself to hit the floor running but I hit the floor Hard I wasn t worried though I thought that I would be at least given training Which I really wasn t In anyway But I soldiered on for four days getting up a lot earlier than I normally would have mental health be damned The pay was so much better no shift work and I could get a bus all the way home meaning that no busy town no social interactions just iPod and a quiet journey home Then four days in the recruitment agency that contacted me initially called I was on the bus leaving town as I had to collect a parcel from one of those amazon thingies as I live in a flat and my wife s mobility isn t great and this was a iPhone so I wanted a secure place for it to go I updated my facebook status New job new me new beginnings Let s do this and let s get life back to what it should be feeling positive I got on the bus and my phone rang It was the recruiter and they had some concerns about my working there The owner wasn t happy that I was asking questions and that I wasn t as good as they expected Don t bother going back My heart stopped and I just didn t know what to do I started to cry but realised as a grown man I had to hold it together on the bus I started to catastrophise terrified I was going to lose my house my bills weren t going to get paid etc etc Then there was my wife What was I supposed to do I got home and tried to be pragmatic I applied for disability I couldn t cope with the prospect of looking for a job in anyway as I knew the box had been ripped open and all manners of hell had been unleashed Pandora had walked off with the proverbial butterfly that signified hope She had walked off crushing it in her palm Disability came through and I was ok for a little bit I ended up in hospital after an attempt but I was getting better day by day I applied for college am doing ok ish on my course I subsequently got diagnosed with ADHD and HMS shortly after and I am struggling but I am finding that some days I am falling under the water and cannot cope I am inflicting a lot of this on my wife being verbally abusive and quite frankly a total c nt I have been physically abusive to her in the past which I am in NO WAY proud of If I had my way before I would not be posting this and someone would have been scraping my remains off the ground floor of a story drop This brings us to now sorry if it seems a little patchy I just wanted to give a little context My OCD is at the point where I cannot stand waking up I struggle with even little things not working just the slightest imperfection in something and it must be rectified there and then It also has left me having to constantly check that I have everything Many times It leads to me being late for things and panicking like a bitch when I cannot find something My memory tends to feed the compulsions I skin pick I cut at spots scars anything that I deem unnecessary This was made very apparent to the disability assessor when I tried to explain things and just couldn t I was left in such a state after that assessment meeting I am so grateful for the person I saw for being so caring and understanding I have found that very little keeps me going at the moment I am trying so hard but cannot cope My HMS leads me to sometimes needing a walking stick It s embarrassing I want to end everything and just make this constant sensation of failure and hell end I have a wife I have an aunt with two little boys that think the world of me I have two best friends again with little ones that do the same I cannot forgive myself for thinking like this But equally I cannot cope with the way my brain is working I don t know what the future will hold I don t know what to do beyond hiding in my room with my laptop and my iPod trying to simulatenously distract myself from myself and hide myself from everything else Thanks for reading if you got this far just writing this down has helped me a teeny tiny bit,"['Critical Risk',

So yeah. Is this normal? I read ab BPD and I have like every sign and like all the traumas that cause it too. But also I’m j anxious and depressed and adhd and ptsd and then also mild paranoia and dissociation so idkkk. But when I read these posts they resonate w me like more than anything else. I went to therapy just cus people told me to and it was awful. Later learned my therapist was a duck but he pretty much told me that me being positive was me being fake and then I spiraled down into like binge eating bc I couldn’t dissociate anymore after therapy. ‘‘Twas bad. He sort of was saying that me having a positive and bubbly personality was all a show tho. But like now I don’t think so like underneath was just nothing so I sort of just turned into this depressed fat person. Now I’m healthy again but it’s just hard feeling things cus I used to be able to dissociate from all feelings. But idek if I have BPD.,['Miscellaneous'],low

Please I need some advice for how to not hate myself Disclaimer I don t think I m like actively suicidal I feel like I m not capable of pulling the trigger myself so to speak yay gallows humor I just haven t felt this awful in a long time and this seems like the best r to ask for help with severe depression and related mental health Also throwaway account Also obviously there s some details missing so that this isn t a novel but I tried to hit everything relevant Where to begin I think I m one of those people who was born already missing my serotonin and the current state of the USA is absolutely not helping it at all My whole life I have been extremely dysfunctional between severe ADHD goldfish brain giving me no grasp on time management or focus and my anxieties exploding my emotions all over the place and my obsessive inability to restrain precision making me suuuper slooow at everything and my autistic social ineptitude making everyone extra done with me My parents weren t the worst but they have narcissistic tendencies and drank the Boomer Kool Aid regarding child care so my difficulties were met with authoritarianism Few brief efforts were made to teach me the critical skills other kids seem to pick up on their own instead I was constantly punished for failing Middle school between my struggles getting homework done and the bullying I was at one of my lowest points ever in my life ADHD meds didn t help either I cried myself to sleep a lot when I did manage to fall asleep Things got a little better when we moved yet again and this time I found friends instead of bullies I got more lenient teachers who understood I was smart but struggling This did not last long because as time went on expectations rapidly outpaced what my raw intelligence could compensate I almost didn t graduate high school on time because of trouble completing some essays I lost my full ride college scholarship because I couldn t manage my studying at all I also was beginning to feel increasingly trapped by my overbearing parents who seemed convinced my difficulties and position as their child meant I was supposed to tell them everything and always obey them To top it off I was finally shaking off the fog of my conservative upbringing once I gained access to more internet and education Oh yeah I didn t have any real internet access until like senior year of high school During the couple short years in college and for a couple years after dropping out I tried getting various jobs to see if I could build any kind of income I worked as a lube tech at Jiffy Lube for part time got fired for struggling to clock in on the dot I worked as a lube tech at a dealership for something got stressed and anxious and dented a couple cars in the hectic environment got shunted to detail worked too slow and dented a couple more cars and got fired I worked at the local zoo in a kitchen met a machine repair guy and got a job for him for a whopping hr Eventually quit the zoo job that had me scream crying on the way home daily to commit to machine repair Few months later the small shop couldn t afford to keep me More time passes I get a job repairing upholstery also at and then stumbled into a job teaching swim lessons nearby too Eventually got fired from upholstery repair for being too slow Thought I was good on the swim job but then my idiot no filter autistic mouth said a couple things that offended a couple customers and my boss s boss fired me NONE OF THESE JOBS LASTED ME MORE THAN MONTHS OR MADE ME MORE THAN HR And I could barely handle my short hr work weeks It should also be noted that I went through a similar volume of various therapists trying to get better at adulting I got a little bit better at coping but not much else At some point I found out all those ADHD meds I had been taking my liver never actually processed the stimulants So I got on a more helpful medicine set and that helped a bit Sometime before the swim job I started going out with a guy who made me feel more motivated and adult than I ever had in my life I was yo at that point He gave me a place to live that wasn t with my smothering parents who made me feel infantile and filled the house with aggression Not being around my depressed narcissist mother especially was super good for my mental health Months go by I m mostly moved in with him After a year of this he has enough money to buy a new house and we fully move in together with trusted roomies This was really helpful for both of us as where he was living wasn t great for him either Fast forward a year later I m the most productive I have ever been in my life But it s so much less than everyone else Our roommates and my boyfriend are so frustrated by my lack of contribution With my parents all I could manage was my own laundry Now I also do the bulk of our house s grocery trips and kitchen scrubbing cooking often and I m barely making my bouncy ball brain do some studying My bf desires to see me succeed in a higher tier job and is helping me study coding and computer IT at home I m decent at doing it but terrible at focusing on it Every day I have to fight past my self hatred to get out of bed and keep fighting to stay out of bed I m worrying my antidepressant isn t working anymore like my last one suddenly did on me I m not far enough along in my studies to get a well paying job yet Disability welfare in this country is a JOKE and would prevent me from any higher aspirations My roommates say the last few times I drove them around in my currently degrading state of mind I made driving errors that make them not trust me I STILL struggle to be on time to anything so nobody trusts me on that either I can t seem to keep a normal day night sleep cycle but I also can t get ANYTHING useful done on an inverse night day sleep cycle On top of it all I can t seem to stick to any of the fun sport clubs I have been part of in the past so I can t seem to keep myself exercising which is of course one of the often suggested tips for depression It s gotten to a point where despite having improved so much at life skills here I am yo and I feel like I did in middle school again Completely hopeless hating myself on a daily basis feeling like just a burden But me hating myself stresses my bf out making him hurt which makes me feel even more worthless He s also super stressed from working a job he hates to make enough money to support us He convinced me to uninstall Netflix from my phone so I have less distractions but I had a super hard time doing it so that annoys him too The things I m already good at like making fixing stuff with my hands or helping little kids without any time management or a degree of some kind I can t get or keep any GOOD job I don t want this to keep getting worse and reach a point where I DO try something bad Right now it feels like I ll hurt people less if I somehow vanish because then eventually they d move on vs right now I actively cause problems I m gonna be talking to my amazing doc about this and finding yet another new therapist to try But I figured maybe someone here can give me some other useful advice to keep me from secretly hoping I get Covid and maybe my asthma will make me one of the unlucky ones lol,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help',

I think I m done with life My depression has been raging over the last few months and I hinged everything on a doctor s appointment that I had today I ve had unsightly chest back acne since I was And I ve been to doctors tons of times for treatment oral antibiotics and a myriad of topical gels Of course here I am years later and not a single one of those treatments helped In january I decided that I d make one last bid for treatment I d go to my doctor and insist on accutane Despite the side effects It seems to have a high success rate for treatment resistant acne And I d rather have months of pure hell with an outcome where I can look in a mirror and not hate myself than live even another day as I am now knowing that I ll always be self conscious about my body and hate myself everytime I look in a mirror Now of course because I m an American And our healthcare system fucking blows I couldn t actually see a doctor for this until a month and half later Where I show the Dr my skin explain how long I ve been suffering and how miserable I feel looking at it I express my desire to go on Accutane And of course he immediately shuts that down Instead deciding in his infinite ignorance that the solution was to give me a combination of two topical gels Ones I had already tried separately with no fucking improvement This of course tanks my mood to the point of basically shutting down communication All I can think of is how I want to die and this fuckwad doctor wants to jerk me around with a worthless treatment He then prods me about why I m suddenly so morose and I lose my shit tell him how my bad skin is one of the confidence destroying things in my life that I fucking hate myself and break down in the room But instead of being helpful he uses it as a reason to start trying to throw psych meds at me This is what I get for trying to improve my life So why the fuck should I even bother living anymore,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I was an anti masker and now have Covid If you want to see the rainbow you have to put up with the rain Wearing a mask and social distancing is a small price to pay for things to go back to normal Until a couple of weeks ago I was an anti masker I live in Florida and work in a restaurant and it was only until masks became mandatory in my restaurant after months of not wearing one that I came around and understood the importance of wearing a mask My excuses were that it is hot I am constantly running around and wearing a mask I thought would slow me down and make me uncomfortable The funny thing is I d never actually worn a mask before so I had no real knowledge of what wearing it would feel like Let me tell you all ITS NOT THAT BAD Sure you might get a LITTLE warmer than you would if you weren t wearing it but that is a reasonable price to pay for preserving the safety and lives of others I have taken a complete on this issue and feel guilty for my stance before Let me be clear A mask does not make you immune to coronavirus I work in an overcrowded restaurant and even after wearing a mask every second at work i still tested positive for coronavirus a few days ago Social interaction is the worst possible thing we could be doing right now and I am quarantined in my house with a lot of things to think about How my comfort used to overrule others safety How I used to hate people pushing for masks how annoying it was and now how important it is If anyone reading this would just take a minute to examine what makes their life more important than anyone else s I think we would have a lot more lives saved A mask doesn t make you immune but it does help And refusing to wear one going out partying and not social distancing is a selfish and deadly exercise to partake in I wish you all well and urge you to please wear masks as often as you can and only go outside for things that are truly necessary The lives and wellbeing of those around you and yourself are more important than your body temperature,"['Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking']",medium

A Meaningless RantHonestly I don t know how to properly put this into words but I feel the need to so I can get some proper sleep rn I have no goals I m a Christian without faith and can t find the point to living anymore I m years old and have never felt more tired in my life in Uni as my daily life drains me more and more And I ask myself every bloody day what s the point of being here I want to die to begin with but I had to have the typical fear of maiming and surviving This isn t a new question it s been haunting me for about years and I don t know how to get any drive back nor has my life improved The coffee doesn t help nor does the medicine I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and they re necessary skills trades But why bother with it when your suicidal the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily I m just taking a random course to begin with so I don t even know why I m even going to uni probably to just meet expectations It s not that I have no one I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know it s a privilege But I just can t seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes In conclusion I guess I wanted to come out and rant to a bunch a strangers about it since I don t know how my friends or non family would take it I ve told my parents that I am in fact suicidal weeks ago they took it well a bit too calmly idk nothing has changed in our relationship for better or worse Ps sorry for the poorly flowing sentences I haven t seen my class on how to write a proper suicidal rant,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Mood Tracking']",high

I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitableI ve graduated from one of the best universities in my country which I d got accepted with a scholarship and national degree in university entrence exams I ve graduated with gpa score I ve gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme I ve played in a great band for the first years of my university life had been selpt with women which I had a serious relationship that last years with of them I ve graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies My first ever game had got downloaded by million people during my first job experience This year at th Februrary everything was changed My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy my parents got divorced and they were very verbal to me about this topic I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries totally different industry that I d imagine for my career I dont know I think I ve accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better I could do better if I was living in a different country I could do better if I didn t waste my time on two long serious relationships I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent s offer to pay for it I didn t want to make them pay for MY education I could do better if I didn t have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme I could do better if I didn t stop making music or writing poems and stories I could do better if I didn t take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey Everything I did seems like a failure to me And worst of all I ve gained a lot of weight my self esteem is on the ground I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything Anyways for people around me I am a succesfull mature intellectual functioning person with interesting hobbies But inside of my mind these things just doesn t matter I was so pumped by my parents my friends and my girlfriends nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills social artistic general etc I dont add value to anyone around me Noone needs me Noone craves for my love needs my support needs me around them I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them I can not seem to get laid nowadays if you exclude some of my ex gf s that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life and boy it was great I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions I used to have strong believes about life politics relationships I m an atheist and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible muslim heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire wannabe highly cultural social media slaves plaza workers bigheaded academics who doesn t give a shit about their thesis student women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in I am so sorry people I wish English was my mother tongue but it isn t and I am not confident the way I express myself This life is too complicating too demanding too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey I want to leave here but I don t know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country Here I am an intellectual succesfull computer engineer outside of Turkey I am a fucking roach I ve sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country Noone wants me How do I escape here Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life Would it worth the effort I don t know Death seems like such a sweet release to me I just want to die naturally at this moment in an instant I had enough I had my peak at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it I ve been depressed before even got some medical treatment for it It doesn t feel like being depressed at all It is just there is no meaning in anything at all We are bunch of atoms Dying will just stop all of it I wouldn t care for anyone and anything If I was dead I wouldn t be upset about the fact that I could do much have children and stuff Dead doesn t care Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive

I can t live with this thought I feel sick During last summer I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people babies that I d never had prior This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD which provided me with a lot of relief In the late evening of Monday rd September after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior I basically watched pornography for around about hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height I d already experienced false memories by this point Anyway for that whole afternoon and night I would go from grinding humping against the bed an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens while watching Porn Hub on my phone to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his year old daughter that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again At this point I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video I shouldn t watch another video afterwards purely because this YouTube video had a baby in it even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone not to mention obviously by content Nevertheless I watched the interview video scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again but with a video loaded Finally I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain s daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn The reason for this is that as best as I can describe seeing her as a baby the pinnacle of innocence exemplified the essential humanity that we all have including the adult performers As a result I felt heavy guilt that I now realize to be misplaced for being what I considered to be anti feminist and an evil person Perhaps I overthink the morality of things I don t know My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff I remember going to the sink afterwards and dry vomiting With regards to the actual first person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video I have no explicit sensory memory of this The image in my head is grainy at best I wouldn t have been able to live with myself were this the opposite After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot I walked through it step by step and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn t done anything wrong and so I left it This as a general worry didn t reappear again till May with the rest of being spent going from day to day worries and false memories I even felt happy and content on New Year s Day this year Surely if I d done this horrible thing I wouldn t have been able to feel anything happy ever again At first I wondered if I did do it and I just repressed it or I didn t and actually it s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety I know that in my heart I didn t do anything wrong as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards and didn t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would ve if I d done anything wrong Things have gotten better mildly My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon I m currently on the fourth day of taking a beta blocker to regulate my heart rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it I m trying to sleep better but sometimes the image creeps in too much I m due to get a new set of the anti depressant mirtazipine soon too But even with that it all feels like too much right now and I m more suicidal than ever about this I don t want to die over an image in my head but is this a belated guilty conscience I feel sick and can t think or sleep I have moments of you know you re being silly start living again but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week I worry that I might out of a morbid curiosity have done it I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it and then as far as I know not doing it,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Need advise to deal with some piece of shit students from my class First of all we still do online school so no it wasn t physical bullying or anything like that It was during an online class when I decided to raise my hand and read a paragraph Keep in mind we can t enable cameras Afterwards as i started reading it for whatever reason my voice got a little deep this might sound stupid af and it sounded like I started yawing for a second it wasn t yawing After that I cough a bit and said excuse me and continued reading it Around the end I hear a message notification and after I ended the paragraph and I muted my mic I opened my phone and saw the message It was a gif this gif https imgur com a Uk O RF https imgur com a Uk O RF and as you can probably see it is someone getting slap through his phone I ignored it but afterwards someone reacted to it with an emote that is yawing After that i asked my self DID THEY REALLY THOUGHT I WAS YAWING You may think this a stupid reason to make a post But the person who reacted to it is one person i trusted Also the guy who posted the gif made fun of me before I m really tired of it He is going to the gym so i can talk back or anything or else he is gonna beat me up and everyone will support him because he is the popular guy Shit like this hurts my feelings and I am a very sensitive person I have all this rage inside of me when stuff like this happens but I can t talk back I don t have the confidence I am the quiet kid you may say No I m not a school shooter I hate that meme and if I talk back who will support me You may say talk to a teacher NO Maybe I am overexaggerating but as I said this not the first time it happened to me Not only from that person but some others to but he is the main reason I m tired of this shit School never made me excited for this reason It makes me fucking depressed Any advise will help please,"['Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

and wanting to dieFor as long as I can remember I ve been angsty but when I was perpetually suicidal for about a year up until a few months ago I thought I had clinical depression I was also having some hallucinations from the stress I got put on some medications and eventually felt better Now I m feeling that way again and I m wondering if maybe this is just how I naturally feel I recently found out I have Asperger s and I know a lot of aspies have constant battles with depression I ve sort of being trying to deny it to myself but every day it is clear that I can t stand life I recently got a job and I think that has made it all worse I was previously a highschool dropout and I spent most of my time in bed and visiting depression support forums People say that once you start doing things you ll feel better but for me doing things just creates things that overwhelm me I have to go to school one day a week for this job I ve got and I m looking through this logbook thing I have to fill out and I know that I just don t give a fuck about it I have no aspirations to succeed I just want to be happy but happiness is nebulously defined for me and I think that s because it isn t possible My mother doesn t know I m suicidal again although I have spoken of how I d like to quit this job and the school My father recently died and she doesn t want me to quit the job because she says we need income She says she doesn t think we could get benefits for me even though I m diagnosed with autism That may just be her trying to coax me into staying though Either way I can t help but feeling my family would simply be better off without me in the long run I am ultimately just a drain on precious resources and I don t care to be here I think the only thing that has stopped me from killing myself is the fear that it wouldn t work Maybe it will get better but I really can t see how and if I was dead it wouldn t matter if it could have gotten better I wouldn t have any conception of it If I had a pill that was certain to kill me right now I know I would just take it I think if I try to kill myself it will probably just be cutting my wrists because knives are easily accessible I know that usually doesn t work but I d go the whole hog and make sure it was deep and long and down the underside of my forearm I m really scared to do that though because if it doesn t work my arm and hand will be thoroughly fucked up I just don t see any reason for me to stick around I wouldn t say I really enjoy anything and life is just a big ball of stress for me I found out recently that a friend I used to have on one of the depression support forums tried to kill herself and it s making me feel like if she can do it then I can do it Hopefully I would succeed and if not at least I wouldn t be expected to work or succeed anymore,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I JUST WANNA BE APPRECIATED a month ago i asked a nice girl in our hich school to get to know me not dating but as friends she told me politely no because our values were different i had waited a long time to ask her to meet me after school because i thought she was nice and everything i knew we had some different opinions but that s not really a problem because my best friends have the exact opposite opinions than i do i was really disappointed when she told me she didnt want to get to know me so this happened today my yr half brother was drinking in a bigger city and needed money because he had no place to go but had money for drinking with friends he and his mom and sister messaged and called me several times and asked me to borrow some money i told i could pay his bus ticket if he wanted to go home and he refused i told them i wont pay a hotel room because i want him to get better and take responsibility they all got mad and my brother said he wont be helping me in the future and then hang up he doesnt respect me at all and only calls when needs money i dont have good relationship with my parents either they dont really appreciate me and my dad once almost killed me a few years ago i just want to be loved im trying to fix our relationship but they make it hard sometimes and then a girl who goes the same high school as i do but is not following me on social media just messaged me and asked if she can ask something personal related to my religion then i just thought okay i dont give a sh t anymore and i wrote a LONG message to her explaining how people only think im this boring religious person and nothing more and im not and i told her i was used to bullied at school and that people at school didnt know how hard my personal life was i told her that i am religious but my best friends are not i am religious but i do other things as well than just read the Bible and so when she had read what i wrote she just told me i shouldnt tell people how i feel probably she was right but i thought she would say something else everything what i had just told her was forgotten and she didnt say anything about it she only asked the question and i answered her the thing is almost everyone almost every person in our school has like friends and are friends with everyone and then there is me i have one friend in our whole student school im thankful i have her but ive always wanted to have many friends and i just dont know how to get them ive tried but no what im saying is that i am way much more than just my religion although it s the most important thing to me and i can be fun and do stuff like sneak from bathroom window at night with my friends or travel to random city and stay at star hotell loose all money and ask strangers to donate me a a few dollars and i like watching cat or duck tiktoks or those tiktoks where people are tell me you are a robot without telling me you are a robot and i love watching netflix hbo disney etc i cry when i think about this world and i pray for people that dont even know i exist i would die for you who are reading this and i am super loyal to my friends i would like more people to acknowledge me im not the best person in the world and im actually pretty stupid and mean sometimes but i can be a true and loving friend if people just wanted go get to know me thank you for reading God bless you btw im a year old girl,"['Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast presence Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television Just a disclaimer I am African American I m sharing an observation and this isn t an invitation for a racist discussion was a wild year when it came to racial injustice All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud Obviously companies see these protests and come out in support and that s fine But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students And many other commercials that you wouldn t usually see a black face on This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race I ve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are normal normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform Maybe I m reading too far into it but it s just what I noticed on television Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress It s upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when it s convenient to show that you support an agenda,"['Positive Coping', 'Mood Tracking']",low

 I am interested in the topic of mental illness and criminality. Today I read an article about an alleged terrorist who had been under surveillance by the FBI for an extended period. During this time, undercovers posed as love interests and terrorist sympathizers to coax a man who they identified as mentally ill into committing crimes. 
 
 Reference: http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2016/03/text_messages_reveal_undercove.html
 
 I do not defend the actions of people who willfully commit acts of violence, but it seems morally and ethically unsound to identify someone as mentally ill then coax them into criminal acts, especially involving terrorism.

"I have a friend who wears his diseases on his sleeve. He'll bring it up any chance he gets. However, all the diseases are easy to get diagnosed for: ADD, Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar (some other stuff I can't remember now). I think he even tried to diagnose himself with autism. At first, I just accepted it, but then he just won't shut up about them. Not just with me, but with complete strangers. It was like he viewed it as some sort of badge.
 
 Not to mention that he would always go through a cycle with his diseases: research, self diagnosis, confirmation from friends (by listing out the symptoms of his desired disease and saying he has them), then comfirmation by a doctor (by listing out the symptoms of his desired disease and saying he has them).
 
 You'd think having a mental disorder is a private matter. My mother had depression for my whole life and I never knew until I found the depression pills she hides.
 
 Anyways, this isn't about my friend really. I'm giving him the support he needs (even though it embarrasses me every time he brags about them). Instead, this is about factitious disorder and you. Do you have real mental diseases or factitious disorder? Read all about it below:

I can t do this anymoreI can t do this anymore I apologize in advance for the long post It started in my freshman year of college I had to drop out because I couldn t adjust to being at a major university not making friends and dealing with college level work I had a mental breakdown and had to see a therapist and physiatrist I was put on Zoloft and another medicine I can t remember That was December of for the first few months of I was a shut in I didn t do anything but stay in bed I found my dads gun but I was too scared to do anything with it I was scared it would misfire and hurt me and not kill me Eventually I began to interact more with friend that were home they didn t go off to school they stayed at community college and then planned on going to university I began to hang with them like old times during high school and got confidence in myself again I started working out on a regular basis again and felt good Throughout the summer of I was making friends and partying staying out late and not taking the medicine prescribed to me because I felt good without it I was smoking weed heavily and ended up losing my virginity while high to a girl I didn t even know on some random day This started a whole downward slope My car began to have issues because I was hanging out with a lot of girls I was considered a fuckboy and the one girl that I had gotten my first kiss from wouldn t date me because of that reason and because her dad is racist I began owing people money and couldn t pay them back because I lost my job I was high one day while my friends were playing basketball and decided to take my friends keys and drive to get something to eat without telling him I posted a girls nudes in our friend group message which led to me being kicked out While all of this was happening I was being recruited to the navy I had stopped smoking to join but I was losing a lot of friends My parents caught me smoking and sent me to a mental hospital It was around the time Mac Miller died Late I was still feeling good because I had something to look forward to joining the navy But soon the thoughts of depression came back after failed hookup attempts with girls I have to this day never had a actual girlfriend I joined the navy in early and made it to the last few weeks of boot camp Where then I failed the fitness test by not keeping my pace running I was sent back in training Which meant I had to do another weeks on top of the I had already been there This took a toll on me I became delusional and because of unfortunate circumstances on the base I was sent to another group The group was for health reasons related to a person who died and they wanted all the people with this condition to stay there until cleared to return All this group did was complain which bothered me even more I had a breakdown and was sent to a physiatrist to be separated from the navy I was still delusional and thought I was going to be in the navy I ended up getting sent to the mental hospital where I spent months before going home When I came home it was the summer of I saw a new physiatrist and it took me a few weeks to realize I wasn t going back to the navy When I realized that I began to spiral I began to constantly eat fast food I stopped working out I got fired after months at my job Throughout I ve gained a lot of weight my hair has began to thin and fall out I ve began to think about suicide I just have had enough I don t have the ability to feel better I have no friends no relationship to look to,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Long story please read and comment I have been feeling extremely suicidal as of late to a degree where I now dream of all the possible ways to end it I typically dream of my old apartment building and jumping off of the pool deck on the top floor I have lost a lot of things in my life and I have struggled with a lot and I just don t have the strength anymore Back story follows I was born into a loving family a terrific father a loving mother and my older siblings and twin brother Well my father found out that my mother was an alcoholic who would drink incessantly and it didn t get this way until my older brother s drug problem started getting worse Well after my father begged my mother to stop time and time again he decided he had enough and when I was my dad left my mum turning her occasional drinking into incessant drinking My twin and I had to live with my alcoholic mother and did all of our lives and the drinking never stopped years after my father leaves my older brother dies of a drug overdose and this makes the already bad drinking into a horrible habit starting as early as or in the morning and being smashed by I didn t know that my mum was the way she was until about th grade I entered middle school a fat loser because I had no friends from trying to care for my mum who always told me she was sick Well I entered and was made fun of all the time for my ears which were a bit large for my head at the time I have since grown into them I was bullied at school and came home to be bullied by my mother and if I was lucky I would have dinner typically I only had breakfast because we had no money for lunch and I could have some bread for breakfast As the years passed the drinking became worse and in th and th grade I attempted suicide a few times not really sure how to actually end it Each attempt failed obviously and each time it angered my mum but we never got me help from the quack I was never diagnosed with depression which I knew I was depressed and we never did anything about my urge to kill myself In my sophomore year I met a girl I thought I loved The relationship was great at first sex all the time and worries later I had never been in a real relationship so I thought this was how it worked We had sex all day every day She was a year older than me so when she left for college things became a bit rocky and I wasn t stable enough to deal with it at the time Shit went downhill and we broke up a few times and eventually went on a break around Halloween time in It was on this break that I met the girl of my dreams It was at my friends birthday party whose birthday rests on Halloween We met up and I was absolutely blown away by how unbelievably beautiful she was We began talking and we had interests in the same bands the same way of thinking the same type of humor We had a blast that night and we flirted cuddled and ALMOST kissed but I realized that would probably be in poor taste Y see my ex the one who said we should take a break never actually broke up with me she only said we should be distant for a bit not that we are broken up so I felt really guilty about everything I had done with this amazing girl who we will call Jill I couldn t confess to Jill what I was thinking I was too scared and pathetic to do so so I broke ties with her Well I found out my ex was fucking a lot of other guys AFTER telling her about Jill and her being pissed at me for even having had feelings for other girls Eventually the bitch ex and I break up and within two weeks Jill and I start dating Jill blew my mind every single day with how fantastic she was she was funny witty extremely smart and exceptionally beautiful I woke up every day and realized I have something worth living for now We were happy all the time and within a month I told her I love her and she said she loves me too that I am the most amazing person she has ever met in her life I was head over heels for her every day was fantastic because she existed in my life and every day was great despite all my other problems because in my life problems don t escape me Well about a month ago she dumped me because she didn t want to be tied down for the time and the shitty thing was I was going to propose in a few short months to be exact I know it is corny but I was going to surprise her at her college and find her in class or wherever and just kneel down and straight up propose to the girl of my dreams my soulmate if you will Well after she left I realized how bad my problems really are and how much worse things are getting now that I have put them on the backburner My debt for school is mounting ever higher and I don t know how to take care of it My college fund has been drained almost entirely and I failed two of my courses this past quarter because Jill dumped me and because I was terribly sick for a month Well I have to wait another months to take them again and I don t know what to do My mother is kicking me out because of my bitter mood even though I don t say a thing to her she also let me know that I am a loser who has done nothing with his life and fucked up the only job I had My Dad is breaking his back to help pay for school and because of my commute and the hours the schools have I can t get a job no one in my area will take on someone who can t even guarantee weekends I am not into drinking or doing drugs because of everything that has happened in my life and because my family obviously has a problem with addictions aunt is a drug addict grandma was too another aunt was also a drug addict My problem is this I have spent so much of my life in denial that now all the deck is stacked against me I have go to a school that I hate doing a major I despise and the college won t let me transfer about of my credits and I have no money to start fresh somewhere else My mother has slipped back into her old demonishing state where she lets me know everyday what I am doing wrong and won t let me stand up for myself My ex Jill is extremely happy now that we are broken up guys are constantly flirting with her on her page on facebook and constantly trying to hang out with her and none of my friends even give enough of a damn to call or ask me to hang out I have been strong my whole life dealing with my mother and having to take care of her and sacrificing my own personal life to make sure she doesn t fall down the stairs in a drunken stupor and get herself killed I was strong when my twin got into a car accident that almost killed him and I was strong when my twin decided to start drinking like my mum does My mum is clean now but she still abuses the fuck out of me and I can t be strong anymore Jill tells me she loves me that she wants to get back together someday because she sees me as her soulmate but I don t think I can just get better and not be sad about what she did to me I don t know what to do anymore I don t even remember what else I should put on here because there were so many problems in my life Please I need some advice I dream about killing myself every single night and all day every day I can t help but imagine how much better life would be without me being alive I daydream about my Jill being happy with everyone else and not caring about me anymore I don t get any support from my friends my dad tells me that I can t dwell on things and my brother would never understand The only person who does understand is my female friend who lives in Canada I am literally on the edge right now and I am so close to just ending it all and calling it quits Please I need some advice TL DR My life sucks my mother was an abusive alcoholic who wouldn t feed me for days at a time my father was never there because my mother wouldn t let him my brother took up drinking one of my older brothers died of a drug overdose I have no aspirations and no plan for a future and the only future I saw myself having walked out on me because she didn t want to be tied down right now I am on the verge of killing myself and need some advice otherwise I will just go through with it,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update',

way there on then very flight I started to feel extremely nauseous bordering on unbearable nausea but we were only some minutes from landing so I pulled through When we arrived I didn t feel better and my nausea kept on albeit at a diminishing rate After a few days I felt fine Back home Sweden I felt almost fine but I would start having these bouts of nausea while at work These would sometimes result in me having to go home from work After a while with this I saw no other option than to go to a doctor This doctor told me that what I expressed seemed like nothing but stress I accepted this diagnosis as I at the time was very stressed out as I had my master s thesis and my work at the same time so I decided to wait things out Eventually my master thesis was finished and I passed and I had only my work to deal with But my nausea never ended At one time me and my then girlfriend went to the south of Sweden to go to a party This would normally entail two hours of train but because of whatever fuckup the train was cancelled and we had to go by bus I took extremely ill during the busride At the time I thought it was common motion sickness but I have never in my life previously been motion sick and I grew up on boats and on cars I shouldn t suffer from motion sickness Nevertheless I ascribed my sickness to motion sickness but I fell ill for more than two weeks Luckily we caught a ride with a car back to our home town which was horrible but better than a bus ride but back home I didn t get better so I finally started to think my ailment was psychosomatic After this I would frequently have bouts of what I can only describe as anxiety My doctor prescribed hydroxine to me which helped momentarily and I am on it now as I write and I feel fine My relationship with my girlfriend finally ended as she went on a semester abroad I felt nothing but relief as I could finally focus on my self I no longer had her to think of I contend that the failure of our relationship was due to my constant depression and not to her leaving I was supposed to go with her but just couldn t Here s the bad part As single I ve been extremely successful I ve constantly have had girls I ve slept around and I have even had offers for long term relationships Yet I have never been happy I have been extremely unhappy I am extremely unhappy I write this from a throwaway but any one of my friends who happen upon this post can easily identify from my circumstances My point is I am extremely unhappy I return home from having been offered to sleep with a girl yet still I did not want to i seriously do not believe it to be related to my former relationship I simply do not want to live any more I am severely depressed I suffer from random bouts of nausea and anxiety which I personally subscribe wholly to something psychosomatic Still I am very much aware of the fact that I do not deserve to be unhappy I have everything going for me I have a great education and girls throw themselves at my feet yet whatever happens I want to die I return tonight from a night on the town that resulted in at least two offers of coitus but I want to die I always want to die I usually am not suicidal I have no wish to end my own life I just wish to die But tonight something was different I think it was because I met an old crush of mine and my failure to ever get with her got to me but never the less tonight was the first time I ever wanted to end my life I am fully aware that the above text does nothing but convince people that I should not even be depressed But that is my problem I am so fucking depressed and the fact that I know I shouldn t be just makes things worse I hate myself for being depressed and I think I should just man up and so thinks everyone I ve told about my troubles But it doesn t work I am so fucking depressed and for the first time ever I want to end it all I just cried and I don t know why I want to die I just want to die so badly but I don t how to do it painlessly TL DR I have no reason to want so but I hate myself and I want to die Please r SuicideWatch Why do I feel like I do Why do cry at the thought of stepping onto a plane why do I want to end it all Why do I want to kill my self just now and how can I end it all I just want to feel better I speak to you rather than just going to a bridge because I realise I do not deserve to be unhappy but I am Please help me,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

My younger sister has been suicidal for a long time and of course I have always tried being there to help and be her punching bag When am I allowed to give up My sister has been suicidal depressed since she was about years old and she has only gotten worse It began when her closest friends in high school ditched her and turned everyone in her class against her Since then she hasn t ever really recovered did receive some help around then She now refuses to seek any more help says she will deal with it on her own and if it doesn t work and she decides to kill herself she s tried her best Because of this decision and her being vehemently against any sort of help she cut our parents out of her life because they tried to make her get help I have been the only one she can turn to She recently stopped being friends with her last remaining friend I talk to her whenever she feels like it but it always seems like whatever I say makes her angry when all I m doing is trying to help Her reactions aren t that of a normal person so it s really hard to try and be there for her and making sure I don t make her angry while doing so At this point it really is affecting my mental health have been working through my own depression and I have no idea what to do I can t imagine if the only person I could talk to decided to leave and would never want to but I also can t be her punching bag forever She also says that if I try and make her get help she will hate me and cut me out too Do I just let her,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I am scared shitless of schizophreniaFirst off I d like to apologize for the wall of text You can skip most of it up until the tl dr mark without missing much Secondly I d like to thank you for giving a shit about a complete stranger on the internet You guys often do a thankless job but I love every single one of you It all started years ago when I was I began experiencing unhealthy amounts of anxiety in social situations my grades were failing and I ended up with a mild form of depression The only thing I looked forward to was coming back home to play video games I shrugged it off as a temporary problem that would go away on it s own but as the years went by more symptoms added themselves into the mix as the old ones became even more obvious I had less and less motivation to do anything I began having more and more suicidal ideations I stopped taking care of my body wouldn t shower shave brush my teeth or put day clothes on except if I had to get out of the house which was rare My parents initially thinking I was just being lazy eventually changed their minds and became very supportive of my troubles They took me to a psychiatrist Here s where it gets confusing He diagnoses me with some form of schizophrenia and immediately puts me on an anti psychotic Risperdal mg day Heart problems massive weight gain pounds in a month panic attacks extreme drowsiness It didn t seem worth it considering this type of AP does nothing to suppress negative symptoms I keep pestering him about the side effects until he finally decides to switch my medication to Abilify another AP that causes me very similar issues He seemed puzzled by all this told me he s never had a patient feel drowsy on a low dosage of Abilify and concluded that I might very well be causing those side effects to myself that if he was to give me a placebo and convince me that it was an anti psychotic I would feel all this He urges me to keep taking an anti psychotic any anti psychotic Fast forward a month or two of switching between the two meds and finding both of them unbearable I tell him I stopped taking them I beg him to reconsider his diagnosis of schizophrenia that maybe the medication isn t doing anything good because I am not psychotic He redirects me to a psychologist who makes me take a Rorschach and a Thematic Apperception Test The guy concludes that I scored like a schizophrenic would and that it was indeed very important that I take my medication without which I could have a psychotic breakdown at any time I think that s the point where I realized I was massively fucked Up until then I managed to tell myself that this schizophrenia diagnosis was just a joke I would play along with on the off chance it was true but somehow having those test results explained to me made the threat very real I ended up doing a lot of research on schizophrenia and apparently every psychotic breakdown will rot your brain from the inside Lowers your cognitive functions including your intelligence every single time No amount of medication or therapy can ever fix the damage done tl dr I attempted suicide a few months back after realizing what fate had in store for me by overdosing on my medication Since then I feel like a piece of shit because my mother is terrified of losing me and has told me on multiple occasions that if I go she goes I don t want to turn into a fucking vegetable I don t want to lose grip on reality I d rather not exist and the only thing keeping me alive right now is knowing that I would hurt my family even more than I m doing now by being a useless fuckup but that last resort is now being tested After visiting a day hospital for group activities the psychiatrist in charge spent half an hour explaining to me just how I m a ticking time bomb who s going to lose control I don t know if you guys can wrap your head around the concept of losing the essence of what makes you a person but it s very very scary I would much MUCH rather die I don t want this piece of shit schizophrenia I ve never had a hallucination in my damn life I consider myself a rationalist and a skeptic I ve never had funky beliefs or delusions I don t do drugs nobody in my family has schizophrenia I never expected I d have to deal with this one day I want to fucking die It s all I think about I can t take a bath without wanting to drown I can t be in a car without thinking of jumping out I keep spontaneously coming up with ideas on how I should end myself H S hypothermia shotgun hanging drug overdose and alcohol I feel like shit I don t want to see myself becoming insane As of today nothing not even their precious anti psychotics can guarantee that I won t slip up at one point in my life To sum up my current situation one of my doctors told me that if we liken someone s personality to a crystal mine is cracked It s not broken yet but the smallest event could destroy it and there s no way to fix it I m sorry if this is difficult to read I haven t had much sleep and I feel like absolute shit,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of

I know it doesn t mean much but here At this point I have no where else to turn too My friends don t want to hear it my family doesn t and so on With what little I have I honestly just need to vent before I die I m the standard age where no one knows what to do or where to go I want to be a writer I m just the fucking definition of a loser I learned a long time ago when I was I was diagnosed with not only depression by a very light form of autism Basicly I don t understand something s when it comes to learning it wasn t anything that couldn t be treated with therapy However the depression stuck I was bullied mercilessly at school and not one of the teachers or principles gave a damn about it They where more content to just watch It was embarressing to them that they had to go up to the government and tell them to fucking fix it Through out that part of my life I was a loner and never thought I would get friends I would just come home from school go play video games and imagine I was a hero a hero that no one understood but still wanted him around Then high school came My first year in grade proved to be the best part of my life I joined Anime Club I became a dnd player I made tons of new friends I helped set up a convention and so on But then grades and happened I met this one girl and at first I was shocked she asked me out first I took her to a movie and we kissed once I think then she didn t want to date me anymore and it was only a three week relationship so I didn t think much of it then her friend came into my English class and yelled stop raping my friend That s where it all went down hill The only place I was from that point was the anime club I was called a freak and a rapist At the same time a guy wanted to kill me constantly tried to set me on fire twice in the same day People relentlessly mocked me and I was the out cast again same deal in g At that point I reached fucked it and for my grad quote I said thank you Flying Spaghetti Monster The only people that liked that where the anime club members and my history teacher Everyone else got mad at me and said that was offensive and it didn t get better from their I left the high school and never turned back after I was done with tests and such Then the college College was to be a fresh start a new beginning but life has a way of fucking you up their as well As I said before I wanted to be a writer I wanted to write sci fi I took psychology English history and political environment But English and political weren t what I thought they where At first English was nice I met a girl their and we started dating for six months and the proffesor was really nice However things took a turn in the classes when it all became about how sucky men are and how awesome women are Both English and political environment kept saying that over and over and over again Men ruined this men ruined that white men destroyed everything that was good Hearing that day in and day out got on my nerves I know I wasn t bad I tried to be the better person in life but it never stuck I felt alone in those classes as no one wanted to hear um what about The writer of game of thrones He s white and awesome And so on but no all the stories we read white men are bad All the political talk was Tumblr and SJW bull shit disproven by multiple doctors and institutions And the tipping point was my gf at the time At first she was the women of my dreams She was beautiful to me shy nerdy a little creepy really liked creepy weird stuff and so on but then she met another girl and this girl twisted her as she was her only friend out side of me She would poke and prod my gf telling her I was bad and intentionally go out of her way to strain our relationship It got to the point my gf was starting to mentally abuse me andverbally abuse me I tried to fight for her I tried and nearly became I love her and I don t care what she does to me But my friends stopped me and forced me to look into the reality of the picture she was bad for me I gave it into our relationship but she gave nothing back I confronted her about it and everything I accused her of she accepted and never even once defended her self She accepted everything I said and had no remorse over it I then told her to go fuck her self and left breaking up with her And then even to add on to that her friend abanonded her after as she got what

I am a recent college graduate (no idea how I made it through school but somehow I did) and I have always had a hard time keeping a job. If I get overwhelmed it is very easy for me to just walk out and never contact anyone from the job ever again. I hate high stress situations. I am a multimedia journalism major with a minor in cinema and I got a lot of training with cameras and editing. I love both of these but I have read this can be a difficult industry to break into. I am unsure where to start and having a lot of doubt in my ability to tolerate difficult/stressful times. What have you found that has helped you cope with difficulty? Anything helps.

I just finished re-reading my favorite one, you should read it!” And take over until I realize I’m taking over the conversation and so I’ll be like “sorry, what was the manga you’re reading?”

 anyway iâ€™ve done a lot of research regarding switching these meds and it seems to be a very individual thing as to how people react to the change

No matter how many times it gets better I just end up at the bottom of the same hole and I m ready to lie in it I m now have tried to kill myself twice before which led to my year on and off again journey through therapy and mental health treatment It s gotten better but I always fall into the ditch and wonder if I should just fucking do it already and do it right this time The thought of my mom having to live the rest of her life with me dead mourning me and my choices is the only thing that sobers me from the suicidal ideations Today has particularly been a rocky day though and I feel like that grip on staying here for her is weakening I started having ugly thoughts tonight like how I was so jealous of Kobe and the other victims of that helicopter crash Or how I wish I were infected with the coronavirus and on my way out I m actually embarrassed to admit this but at the same time feel so passionately about these desires it scares me For the first time in I think maybe or years I started researching suicide methods My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe but I don t know what I even need to say to him besides sorry Still this terrifies me but excites me I just crave life to be over so often and I m getting restless No matter what happens in life I always end up in the same place I keep fighting but I m wondering who s battle is this actually I m definitely not fighting for myself anymore I ve officially given up and am just waiting for my dad to come home from a trip so I can see him one last time,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I am scared i m scared shitless i thought about killing myself several times over the years but now something came up and if it s bad then I might just do it i do not know why i havent done it yet im tired of being a failure of disappointment to my family especially my mother Maybe it s the thought of her finding me dead and probably wondering what did she to do deserve this what did she do wrong she is the only family I have as my father works overseas and he didnt impact my life very much I see him just the one that sends us money so we do not starve if there was another person to do that I wouldn t really miss him My sister lives h away and I hate she said some terrible things to my mother after she went drinking because she wouldn t pay her some stupid debt we couldn t afford it and spread the rumor in our natal town rural town that my mother is a whore my mom knows it and she got over it she dares to look my sister in the eye and tell her i love you it s stupid my mother is everything to me but this world is just stupid to me im thinking about the peace that may come one i close my eyes black silence no more pain no more anything I ll let this life behind but that s scary and I m a guy that gets scared easily I may die quick or slow or with huge pain or no pain at all but that s impossible to know right,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I can t do it Please help I honestly genuinely want to die The reason Life s just lost its colors it s gotten stale There might be more to it but I m too tired to even ponder it There definitely used to be more though The closest I ve gotten to doing it was to dance on the train tracks but I only ended up with a slightly bloody hand and embarrassment I feel like I m bothering people and I have friends with real depression I d feel disrespectful to talk to them about my fake shit A friend talked me out of it once but I m too awkward and cowardly to admit to him that I m not fine this time I don t want to drop hints because I consider it attention whoring I mean if others do it that s okay They deserve help If anyone asked me what was wrong months ago I would have had a ton of reasons to wish it but didn t want to do it Now I have no reason to wish it but I want it more than ever This is why I can t even ask for help I have nothing to say Well aside from school That s probably one of the main reasons but it s so insignificant and selfish that I d be a hypocrite to talk to others about it like it was a huge deal because it shouldn t be But it really is Still if I don t want help I want the easy way out I guess I have walking depression but I can still laugh and smile all day The only thing stopping me is the fear of the afterlife if it exists I go to hell and I m fucked If it doesn t exist I just wasted what isn t even half of my life and prematurely plunged into the eternal void I don t feel sad but I don t want to live either If you gave me a gun a week ago I would have pulled the trigger I don t know if my friends still like me I m probably annoying I just want some words of peace something that can give me courage and convince me to do it I guess This is the only related sub I know although it s the opposite of what I want Thank you lt,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

depressed anxious and overwhelmedHi so this is going to be extremely rambly because I m so anxious depressed I can barely string thoughts together Right now I am in an outpatient program I was inpatient before that and I m terrified I have horrible suicidal thoughts every time I go home but when I m at the program I m fine My new medication is upsetting my stomach even more than how my stomach usually is and I was told to tolerate it for a couple more weeks and see if it will stop They want me to go home for good in a couple weeks and that s even after I bargained for more time My mom is spending tons of money for me to stay in a motel and drive a couple hours back and forth on the off days from home to the program I m beyond anxious and I feel like there s no solution to my problems and I feel like such a burden to my mom and it s driving me crazy I feel like I have no future I m and I don t have a job I m not in school I don t know what I want to go to school for maybe I want to be a therapist maybe that s what I think I SHOULD do because I think my life has no worth if I don t help people I dunno I don t know if I could even handle school I suffer from severe undiagnosed fatigue issues and also some GI issues from taking antibiotics for a year and I could only manage to take one class a semester when I was going I think I should probably go to school away from my family to get out of my shitty area and house and to become more independent and reduce distraction but I have this fear that by leaving my parents I m going to regret leaving and losing that time with them when they die which is very overwhelming aaaaaand lastly I have only one friend who I met through the program but they live hours and hours away from me so I m struggling to accept that too because I already feel attached and I m trying to find reasons to stay in the area afterwards like going to school in the area just so I can be close friends with them and hang out all the time I m really trying not to kill myself right now but I m just drowning in pain and anxiety and fatigue and I can barely get out of bed No one can seem to help me and I just want to die to make it all stop,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
Hey there Thinking about killing myself So I ve been depressed for a long time first time I felt like this I was years old I m now It kinda comes and goes I m on my final year of university and although I got good grades I don t think I can finish this year which I would be terribly sad if I didn t and it s what s likely to happen Studying is one of the few things I enjoy doing but when I m depressed I can t even read a paragraph before thinking about killing myself I ve been trying to fake it till you make it approach since my first year I m popular around campus throw a lot of parties I m not bad looking and I pretend not to be shy so socially I m really good at pretending to be a extovert outgoing guy Though my friends have been suspecting that my heavy drinking and drug use is a excuse to hide something else an assumption which they are more likely correct I like people I feel an empathy that is abnormal which is a recurring issue in making me depressed If I see someone sad or miserable looking I instantly feel how I think that person is feeling hollow I could be the richest most sucessful best looking person in the world I would still be depressed there s nothing that can change this I just don t like life and I fail to see any way that it would be better Although I might feel empathy I can t actually like anyone I can t love anyone that I ve found in my live I hate being around my friends and family and I hate to pretend I enjoy it They are good people but it s annoying to be around people that don t understand not depression but how meaningless is anything they say or do Nothing makes any sense The only thing that keeps me going is that I only get one living it s obvious I will have a happy day in my life actually I bet I still haven t lived my happiest day But is it worth it Would you live your life as a begger just because you know that in your last day you would be a billionaire I m thinking about just jumping I don t think there s anything for me here Only in my sleep I find peace,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
Pushed to the edge and trying to find hopeI haven t made a post like this before but have reached out in the past with career guidance and the such Right now I m not doing well and I m in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that won t scare and worry my friends and family I ve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last years of depression and anxiety now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis one month ago My post isn t a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around My now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night Now Some of my best friends got married this week where my ex was the maid of honor I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day many advise no on the friends with the ex especially in this situation but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner and just want my friendship that I have had with her to remain I don t have many friends left around me The night before their wedding I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didn t say much more than that My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi Polar disorder They don t understand it and Don t believe I am and think I m chasing something that doesn t exists The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to But I wasn t able to I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do And told her I don t think being friends will ever work I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding My friends and fraternity brothers All this is too much for me right now with the added fact I ve changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I don t find meaningful or fulfilling And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole I know now that it s a problem I need to work on I ve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little I don t know how they feel but I can imagine it hurts is frustrating and an annoyance they didn t need I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself That it would magnify the pain I m feeling and put it on to them I m just so unstable right now even on medication therapy and exercise I know I can reach out to my friends for support and don t want to burden them I m just so afraid and lonely right now I don t want to die but death is looking more and more favorable I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away To anyone that reads this thank you,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

The inertia s finally running outI ve spent the last or so years suppressing my desire to kill myself to finally die and not have to deal with any of this shit anymore and I don t even know why I don t know why I ve kept going until this point other than the fact that I m too poor to buy a gun I dream about it I fantasize about it It s the only remaining thing I have to look forward to my job is a dead end I m not going to college I have no real friends nothing to make me want to stick around I m beyond the point where this is just a quick escape from a bad situation my life has been shitty and pointless for years now and I m sick of coasting along just because I can t bring myself to do anything else I m unwilling to put the time and effort into spending years in college to maybe change something or to try and find a new shitty job that pays just as little that amounts to nothing more than a change of scenery or to find someone to talk to about this to try and hear them explain why my life is a precious thing I shouldn t waste or some shit like that I m just sick of this There is not a single aspect of my life that appeals to me in any way any longer and I m tired of staying in a world I don t want to be part of just because it s expected of me I just want to end this I ve dragged it out long enough already I don t stand to gain anything by continuing in this grain all that ll happen is I ll just postpone it even longer Hell I don t even know why I m bothering to post this because at the end of the day I m just gonna force myself to go to work in a few hours like nothing s wrong then come home to dream about finding a loaded gun again I don t want to be talked out of it I don t have any way to do it in the first place I guess I m just doing this because this is the kind of thing suicidal people are supposed to do I genuinely don t care if any of you are interested in trying to talk me out of this I just feel like saying shit that there s no way I could say under my real name,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

After trying so hard she s ready to give up everythingEdit I m sorry this ended up being a wall of text out of my own anger I m really not sure where to start with this I m going to explain what I know as well as what I think is occurring My cousin has had a rough year She can t find a job due to job market being crappy she doesn t know what she wants to do for a career she is out of school because of financial trouble and she was diagnosed with a type of cancer that may prevent her from having kids She isn t married but I know she has always wanted to be a good wife and mother someday All of those problems are awful but there is something else that upsets her more Last night I was forced to go to a family event and I spoke with her to kill time I learned that she was still with a guy that she had problems with late last year I don t know what kind of problems I only know that they both messed up and were trying to be adults about it and repair their relationship I thought that was really nice that instead of breaking up they were being reasonable and realistic in order to stay together But I think something else must have happened recently something bad During the time that the two have dated I noticed all of her accounts on different websites disappearing completely Her Facebook disappeared first That one was always pretty inactive so I didn t say anything about it when I first noticed it was gone But she used to post drawings weekly on a few sites and kept a blog for writing and one for photography She also used to frequent Reddit All of those accounts are gone now I thought why she would trash her art and stories like that I felt like I was going to explode if I didn t ask her about it so I hinted at it in conversation She told me My boyfriend thought I relied on the sites for attention I want him to see that I don t She said that with a happy face I couldn t believe that was the reason She drew things she liked for herself she didn t draw things other people liked to gain attention I asked her about the other sites and got similar answers I don t know what has happened between the two I don t know if my cousin ever was an attention whore If she was she certainly isn t now She is nonexistent cautious humiliated and very down on herself I stopped asking her about it and we sat down When she was reaching for a napkin she accidentally tipped over a glass that has a small amount of water inside She stood up to clean it and apologized dozens of times I heard her mumble to herself You idiot You retard She has never had good self esteem but this is a new low I later asked her if her boyfriend has ever called her names She said yes but it was because she always did something to deserve it I can t imagine what All I know is that I would never call someone I loved a retard And if that word ever came out I would apologize immediately I don t know how this man talks to his family and friends but I don t think it s the same way that he talks to my cousin I noticed she has harmed herself physically She has also lost weight Whatever he has said to her it s been bad enough to make her physically ill and stressed enough to harm herself to escape it I used to harm myself and I know how much mental pain you have to be in to do it I can t believe someone put her through that and wasn t worried enough to change how they communicate I had to go to go back to the house the gathering was at to pick up my coat Since her home is in the area I stopped by to ask her if I could see some of her art I figured that might cheer her up I just realized that I forgot to mention her and her boyfriend are in a long distance relationship That is relevant because while at the gathering last night she was asking about jobs from relatives that live in the same state as the guy She had no luck When I got to her house she had about fifty tabs pulled up online for jobs in his area I noticed her room was very bare She used to have posters on the walls stuffed animals on her bed you know it looked like a room someone lived in and liked Now almost every single thing she owns is in boxes and a lot of her personal items seemed to be gone She told me not to worry that it had been packed up for weeks That makes me think that she s been just as stressed for weeks and that s worse As I have said I have no idea what they re relationship is like entirely I know they ve had really bad fights and it s put her in a very dark state of mind But I also know he s flown her out to his parents home and taken care of her during her stay with no problems at all I feel like she will do something drastic if she doesn t get to move If she moves or doesn t she has a lot of healing to do Her self esteem is very damaged I asked her why she was so stressed about finding work she responded He doesn t think I have tried He doesn t think I care for him I do everything wrong I have to do something right I disagree with that If I didn t I wouldn t be posting here I know her boyfriend shows he cares by taking her out to eat and buying her gifts She isn t doing well financially and neither are her parents so she shows her feelings by making amazing art pieces and sewing stuffed animals and key chain characters based off of good memories about their relationship I know he s thrown the gifts in the trash with her in the room I m guessing he s also made her feel bad about the times he s spent money He calls her names and has convinced her she s retarded I can t tell if he has a bad way of showing he cares or if he is the one that has mental problems The breaking point for her seems to be when he says that she doesn t care If she didn t care why would she spend hours on art and sewing Why would all her possessions be in boxes Why would she be applying to every job she can find from a fast food cashier to a janitor I am so confused that she does all of those things and that he flies her out to see him and then says that she doesn t care about him The last thing she said to me was What if he doesn t love me after all of this I won t know what to live for Their relationship none of my business I am just very angry that my smart and talented cousin has been cut down by a man that she wants to be with I think we have all had our feelings hurt by someone we care about But I have never been in a serious relationship so I don t know what to say to her There are two sides to every story but I really don t care what his is I don t think whatever he says could make it okay that my cousin has hurt herself and given up almost all of her hobbies that make her who she is I certainly don t think his story would make me feel that my cousin should die I don t know how to help her She probably doesn t want to talk about the bad parts of the relationship there isn t much I can do to help her find work and worst of all I wouldn t know where to start when helping her build self confidence back up I might ask her to post here if she feels like talking Please don t assume that my cousin has mental issues because of this She is a very caring person probably too caring sometimes I just don t want her to end her life or think that there is no good reason for her to live just because someone she loves thinks it s normal to verbally abuse her like that,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping',

My Girlfriend Tried to Commit Suicide Today I m Not Supposed to Talk to Her Anymore I Need Help Long one guys but I m fucking shaking I have no one to talk to about this I started Dating Aly about a year ago Found her on tinder Turned out we went to the same middle school yada yada Aly has kids with the same father I am the father of a nearly year old We are both yrs old When we started dating she told me about her past Let s just say she hasn t had it easy Father committed suicide A failed marriage Etc I m also not in the best place right now My own custody battle is a story of its own and it s as bad as you can imagine Like that YT video of the lady fighting with the kids father about their haircut type of bad Since my son was born I decided to turn my life around Become more responsible get a degree yada yada I m actually proud to say that I ve already gotten an associate s degree bought a house been promoted It s not all been smooth But I m starting to see the changes I set out to make But I m way far from where I would like to be Not done by a long shot I literally see my son days out of the month and it fucking kills me It feels like torture Slow painful torture So anyways Aly s place was just down the street from mine So she would be over all the time and eventually her kids too So six months later she asked to move in I immediately raised some flags Reminded her about my situation with my kid going to school hour long weeks getting home at PM and working on the computer until AM I told her I had lived on my own since I left my parents and I literally didn t even know how to coexist with another human being She said she understood and it didn t matter She was also paying a month for rent and spending half the time at my place so from a financial perspective it did make sense So I reluctantly agreed Aly is amazing And I mean amazing She would like do everything around my house even though I would beg her not to She fucking loves my kid so much And it s genuine When he was diagnosed with autism she started researching got some type of autism therapy degree and just overall looks after him like if it was her own I ll go as far as to say that Aly is by far a better mom to my son that his actual give the kid an iPad and ignore him for the whole night evil spirited ass shitty excuse for a mother mother God I hate her So fast forward months and Aly has completely changed Lost extreme weight Taking prescription pills this palpable sadness always in her stare I know what s up immediately Because she told me She wanted more She wanted a baby with me She wanted me to say I love you back when she said it she wanted me to text her more take ker out more often Travel You know the little things And you know what She was right to want all those things She deserved them She had life throw every single bad scenario at her and she still turned out amazing Raised amazing kids Helped me with everything Hell yeah she deserved every single thing she asked for and much more I decided to be blunt it s hard for me to say no and I often commit to things that I know I don t want or can t do and I told her that at least for the time being Nothing about our relationship was going to be any different I am still committed to getting my life together and most importantly more time with my son I told I wasn t ready to have a baby I told her I probably wasn t going to travel and do all the things she wanted At least not very often Or actually not often at all But I told her she didn t have to settle around my plans and I understood if she didn t It would be selfish for me to ask her to just ride it out for a few years knowing full well she would do it if I asked I couldn t bear seeing her sad I couldn t bear knowing I was the cause of all that pain She shouldn t have to feel bad for wanting those things and put up with someone who wasn t as invested in the relationship as she was Man she didn t take it well She told me she didn t want to cause me any trouble or feel unwanted somewhere and that she would be out by the next day I told her she wasn t unwanted I was perfectly fine with the current situation I just knew that she wasn t I knew that she was sad And that I wasn t going to lie to her or lead her on The next day everything was fine As if nothing had happened Almost like if the conversation itself was all that she needed and she even seemed happy I dare say That same day I get this weird text from my kids mom Asking me to accompany her to an xray procedure for our son super weird that she would ask me to come along And to help her do her taxes I showed the text Aly and she said yeah she is just trying to spend the day with you Which I agreed was probably the case Nonetheless I told Aly I would go to the xray procedure because if anything else it would be a chance to see my son even if for a short period And that I definitely wouldn t be doing anyone s taxes As I m in the hospital something happened something finally snapped with Aly I get a frantic call from her friend that Aly had phoned her ex husband saying to take care of the kids and that she would be taking a bunch of pills Cops paramedics family Everyone rushed over to help her She had indeed taken a bunch of pills I heard about Xanax of whatever mg but idk if that s even possible some wine and slights cuts to her wrist She was rushed to the hospital and is now in stable condition Her family is not mad at me They told me that Aly sorta has a history of just straight up tragedy after tragedy turns out the guy she dated after her husband who she was madly in love with just randomly died of a heart attack and told me that the best thing I could do if I truly care about her is to block her number To not let her in my house To make sure I let her know I am absolutely not interested in even talking to her I understand the rational But man how can I just straight up ignore someone who has done so much for me I know it s not about my feelings I should think what s best for her I just don t think I can do it I m so fucking lost I need help,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress

Anyone planning suicide in the long term future I m a depressed F who is considering suicide but not soon but within maybe years Why do I want to kill myself It s kind of a long story But the main reasons are a combination Lack of Economic Stability Health Problems Family along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life Economic Growing up was hard and I ve had to overcome a lot of adversity lower income household mother dying at a young age being a queer person of color strict parents depression etc like a lot of people here I m in college currently but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major college just seems very oppressive I know it makes me sound like an entitled first world millenial My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school not allowing me to choose a different school or even CC for a few years I had relatively good grades in high school I knew from the moment I was on campus that I hated it lack of diversity and friendship my health was negatively impacted I didn t have a good sense of direction or idea for a major career and never felt inspired I thought about transferring but didn t have the resources or finances first generation college student so I stuck it out though I was depressed I did well academically but since my major department is kinda shitty applied math I m worried that I won t get a good paying job unlike engineering students Like had I known earlier I would have just majored in that instead I will leave college next year with about K in loans Family Generally I strongly dislike my family life My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house as fast as they could My mom died at a young age and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming self sufficient my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife unemployed and kids even though he s pretty old and should be focusing on retirement I haven t come out as queer yet but worry that my family will disown me because of it not super religous but super conservative strict and family oriented My parents are also immigrants so we don t have tons of wealthy family here Health I have a lot of chronic probably genetically caused health diseases since I was young When I was young and in my mid teens I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive After my mom died my dad didn t bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists anymore my health has decreased It s hard at college too because I don t have a car and I didn t always have health insurance to be able to see anyone So my health continues to decrease These aren t life threatening health issues but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self conscious So because of all this I find it hard to justify continuing life I am kind of a nihilist and definitely an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife I don t want to kill myself yet but in years when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide planning once I m in the real world I ve seen many psychologists over the years but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable and condescending even It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first generation college student background with severly limited family support chronic health issues and student loans to be economically secure in like even years And it s hard to see my straight white male friends from more accepting and upper middle class families succeed in life when it s a constant struggle for me And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery what s the point Why suffer and struggle so much in life if I don t really see a reason too Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed with me and is truly planning suicide in the future I m also fine with talking to people about my choices and or expanding on the reasons above though I doubt people can change my mind TL DR Want to wait years before committing suicide Basically I personally see life worth living if I m economically secure have supportive family and friends and am generally healthy However for a multitude of complex reasons all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me I am also a nihilist atheist and don t see a point to life other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Shall I be joyous or shall I be damned Warning major long read ahead In the interest that the continuation of my life is pretty much up in the air over the next couple of weeks I ve decided to get the whole story out in the open although I doubt it will do much to help I ve never been diagnosed with anything but I m self aware enough to know when something is fundamentally wrong and depression seems like the best fit Anyway ever since I had a complete emotional meltdown during basic training for the US Army and was sent home on a general discharge I haven t been able to pull myself together with the same zeal I had when I was younger Those of you who have been through basic successfully will undoubtedly know someone like me that had everything going for them and the training isn t actually that hard but for whatever reason just snapped My family supported me well enough and the world kept on turning I brushed the incident off and started working going to college all over again Ever since my job history has been filled with initially hopeful prospects that quickly nosedive into extreme emotional outbursts that cost me my employment I spent my breaks at my first job since I returned home crying in the parking lot I was fired from the next one for punching a bathroom door in a tearful rage that struck me out of nowhere and the next few were lost due to similar over reactions that caused me to quit on the spot All of this has pretty much ruined any credibility I could have had in a job hunt as I have a grand total of ONE job that I would in theory be eligible as a rehire and I had a nervous breakdown that similarly ruined any chances I had at scholastic achievement The kicker was I could still brush this off and keep trying my grandparents owned a fairly successful business so I could live with them they raised me since my mother abandoned me and work for them and all would be fine Then out of the blue my grandmother died the day after I had a heated argument brought on by one of my emotional episodes and as she controlled most of the business details our company descended into a chaos it still hasn t wholly recovered from Sometime before this I had reconciled with my biological mother and my half sister so we came together to try and fix things and keep the company running Meanwhile my grandfather who was normally a pillar of strength and morality shook us all to the core by immediately hooking up with a year old woman down the street before we even had his wife s ashes We were so disgusted and depressed by this turn of events we decided to move to California by this point I was secretly suicidal for feeling like I contributed to my mother in practice s death so I was willing to try anything to get my life back on track but still help with the business remotely As those of you who live here will probably attest this was a bad idea We had no luck finding jobs at all not even minimum wage and next thing I know I m looking at bank statements and realize my biological mother had stolen from the business account to pay for our expenses Then she and my sister abandoned me here in a half empty house I don t have the rent money to pay for anymore successful months of credit building down the tubes it seems the business is teetering on the brink I ve alienated my grandfather by associating with them and being pretty unkind to his new slut trophy girl and here I am wondering just when the fuck everything went all looney tunes I had amazing prospects once I thought the world was mine for sure now I m in debt up to my eyeballs miles away from anyone I know about to lose my car and piss off a great landlord Part of me just wants to say fuck it all let the debt callers come and indulge the darker side of my emotional outbursts until I m put down by police or somehow become a super villain part of me wants to go crawling back and try to salvage my old life one last time to no real satisfaction and the last part says to simply take my gun wander off into the desert and put an end to this silliness once and for all TLDR No job no degree massive debt staring down the business end of a and wondering if I m pointing it in the right direction,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I don t want to live but I don t want to kill myself after a lifetime of hardship I was diagnosed with BPD I had a really shitty childhood I can t remember one time where my mom held me when I was sick or sad or read to me She instead would severely beat me until I would bleed out my ears or pass out My step dad sexually abused me for years two of them even after I was adopted My parents always told me I was only alive because the condom broke and you can t have a retroactive abortion I was raised basically white trash After I was adopted by my moms parents my life got a little better but the damage was already done I showed symptoms early in life Got worse when I got into my mid s I lost my fianc e of years because of the constant suicide attempts and mood swings and pushing people away The black and white way I relate to things made the breakup super horrible I lashed out I said horrible things I threatened him He left me with no goodbye no closure Just blocked me from everything and changed his number Shortly after the breakup I had a mental breakdown and was put on not one or two medications but seven high dose mood stabilizers anti depressants anti psychotics and benzodiazepines I didn t get better I just learned to hide my suicide attempts and cutting because I knew if I talked about it I d be taken away from what little normalcy I have For three years I struggled with high dose pills that caused me to get a DUII Nobody mentioned to me I couldn t drive but I guess I should have known better Two theft charges I would get so strung out and high on pills that I would walk into stores and not pay for simple things like a sandwich months ago while on a court mandated mental health program my best friend brought it to my attention that I have little memory function from the time I ve been taking prescriptions I don t remember things I don t have a picture of I m so drugged up all the time he can t have a conversation with me Getting high on marijuana is one thing but being dosed up in pills is another I go to DBT IMR and dual diagnosis groups that don t helped and make me completely miserable I spent days in jail because I refused to take my court mandated medication I was done I went through the worst withdrawal of my life Shortly after I was taken out of the mental health program and put off probation I still don t know why it might have been because I don t have a crippling drug addiction paired with a mental disorder with prison time looming over my head but digress I m completely off medication now I don t want to hurt myself or anyone else I just want to die I m tired of living I m tired of always being tired I m tired of being in my room I live in a small town where most people my age drink or so hard drugs so meeting people is hard My best friend lives in Canada My two other close friends are regular people who all live in another state Since I can t drive for almost another year school is on hold I ve gained roughly lbs since I started taking meds when before I was running miles a day Now I can barely make myself get out of bed and shower However I m not depressed Im not anxious I just don t want to wake up anymore,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"Abilify (Aripiprazole) has shown some clinical effectiveness in treating borderline personality disorder.
 
 And let me just say, these magic little tic tacs have made a world of difference for me, when combined with therapy and my antidepressant. A year ago, my romantic relationship was particularly triggering, and I was prone to episodes of rage and self harm. I felt horribly inadequate, alien and at a constant risk of being abandoned.
 
 Nowadays, my moods are steadier, without any sense of being ""zombified."" It feels like I have a chance to practice some self-soothing exercises when I'm feeling triggered, as opposed to suddenly flying into blinding, red-hot fury or a suicidal spiral of desperate sadness. My self perception is also a lot more rational- I still see my faults, but they don't seem world-ending, anymore. The people around me seem more accepting, trustworthy and empathetic. 
 
 Even if they're not prescribed Abilify, I highly recommend that anyone who is feeling ""stuck"" in their current treatment speaks to their psychiatrist about treatment options. I had to specifically ask about them, months after my diagnosis, to start the conversation. 
 
 It's worth it, and so are you.",['Progress Update'],medium

I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff have been unemployed for years so I will be choosing between suicide and very soon Open to unusual suggestions Just read the bold text as a TL DR if you want amp x B Background I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree German that I deeply regret in December The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues I have a little OCD some Borderline Personality Disorder traits and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis I have spent out of the years since I graduated unemployed It took me a year to find a job I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly That happened just eight months after I had left my parents house I didn t even make it a year on my own That was a year and a half ago I cannot find a fucking job I have tried everything amp x B The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree Over the past month for example I have applied to jobs and only made it to a nd round in person interview times So here we are amp x B I m ready to die I have a note and a plan amp x B I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the people who are part of my life behind I have read enough of r SuicideBereavement to know what it d do to them and I don t care most of the time amp x B My suicide method of choice is irreversible Guaranteed to kill me This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn t take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn t high enough I will be gone Thus I must be very certain about having no other options left amp x B Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you ll say why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents That is not something I can accept I didn t push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now there is no way I could work at Macy s or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself amp x B I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine amp x B At this point I don t know what the fuck I can do Here are the things that occur to me at this point in order from most reasonable to least amp x B Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a temp to permanent role that actually pans out The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house even if it is full time amp x B Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide amp x B Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language TEFL certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway I have a car that is worth around that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification amp x B Accept my suicide as inevitable living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else k gets you a long way in a third world country You may laugh at this but I m actually kind serious about this one amp x B Kill myself Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it That s it This miserable existence I never asked for would be over I have had sex fallen in love been to Europe enjoyed meaningful friendships done psychedelics Its been nice But I can t take this shit anymore at the same time Every day is the same Sitting at this fucking desk Miserable Insane Lonely Hopeless I think about suicide constantly amp x B Do you have any ideas for me What would you do amp x B,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress',

In Canada what are the consequences of making a suicide attempt and recovering LONG text sorry This subreddit is very quiet but I don t think my question would be allowed in r AskReddit r AskCanadian subreddit is very quiet too I hope someone knowledgeable can help me Please correct me if I m wrong When you attempt suicide in Canada and police or paramedics are called this event is recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre CPIC database as well as any relevant local police and medical databases From googling I ve found out that consequences include I won t been able to get a firearms license a wise restriction I probably won t be able to travel to https www thestar com news gta canadian woman denied entry to us because of suicide attempt html or through the USA suicide attempts can be recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre database which is somewhat https en wikipedia org wiki Canadian Police Information Centre accessible http www cbc ca news canada windsor canadians mental health info routinely shared with fbi u s customs by the FBI and U S Customs and Border Protection If a person attempts suicide recovers and is able to become mentally healthy and live a normal life what other permanent negative consequences are there Can insurance companies dig up this information Affecting extended private health life or even auto insurance eligibility Will prospective employers be able to find this through background checks Will mental health history be covered in the Canadian Government Security Screening I mean will you be treated like a convicted criminal not allowed to work with confidential information like someone who helps do your taxes or a medical office assistant transport medical supplies like insulin or donated blood or transport hazardous materials like a freight truck driver transporting a load of pool cleaning supplies Security screening focuses on your reliability https en wikipedia org wiki Security clearance Canada I can t find specific mention of mental health but I think that can be considered a significant factor of a person s reliability I also don t know the negative long term consequences of having suicidal thoughts or involuntary hospitalization in my medical record Will this also hurt my ability to get a job or insurance I m afraid to admit to anyone that I ve seriously considered killing myself I don t want to be involuntarily locked up for three months https www legalline ca legal answers involuntary hospital admission of mentally ill people and length of stay or more Years ago I had a psychotherapist who just kept prescribing different drugs which left me feeling extremely detached unable to concentrate on anything and a lot of other side effects like dry mouth I don t want that again I hated those drugs I had a very difficult time finding a psychotherapist who seemed right for me I hesitate to say this but I found some of them very unprofessional one spent all of our sessions asking me technical computer questions and essentially getting paid to pester me as his personal IT support person he was the drug pusher another was working hard on an academic thesis with a really narrow focus which he forcefully tried to apply to all of our therapy sessions whether it made sense or not He would ignore any patient problems or issues if they were not dream related and can also be drawn on paper He adamantly refused to do anything else I couldn t make this up if I tried All of this turned me off of therapy for years Canadian healthcare might be better than in the United States in some ways but there s a lot of flaws and problems too In recent days I had been having increasingly frequent suicidal thoughts but so far it s gone down and I ve been holding steady I managed to find a relative to talk to Not a resolution or even a reliable source of support but it s pulled me back from the edge Also finding this https www camh ca en hospital health information a z mental health and addiction information suicide Pages default aspx web page at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Canada helped It s slender comfort but where the page explains why and Who is at risk and What a re the warning signs it was like a brief warm sunbeam because whoever wrote that web page understood exactly how I feel Thank you for taking the time to read all this I hope someone can answer my questions How screwed am I if there are records of me having attempted suicide or being locked up in a hospital or even admitting that I wanted to die,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I m heading back into that direction Sorry about the length A little back story I spent years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka I don t remember much about that night I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible I woke up to a trashed apartment I gave my landlord my day notice submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier I made a miscalculation though I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers supervisors and politics I had to deal with I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust I m afraid to tell her anything now because I m afraid I ll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking I m in the same rut I was before I feel desperately alone and depressed The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months Its hard to not beat yourself up when you ve lived alone isolated from about a dozen people for three years I feel like all my hard work has been futile now I stopped going to the gym I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape The constant introspection began to drive me mad I feel like nothing has changed I m still miserable and I m still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker I haven t felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment I m worried if it gets worse I may take up drinking heavily again and try to drink myself to death tl dr Was in a rut tried to kill myself Got help and now I m crawling back into my hole,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
How I gained weight from being Anorexic So I just made a body positivity post yesterday on my body years ago vs my body now days ago I received a lot of love and support so thank you But a lot of people asked me questions and here is my answer What is anorexia In the DSM the book of mental illnesses and disorders yes I have read it yes I read it sometimes anorexia is defined as A Refusal to maintain bodyweight at or above minimally normal weight for height age less than th percentile B Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming obese even though underweight C Disturbed by one s body weight or shape self worth influenced by body weight or shape or persistent lack of recognition of seriousness of low bodyweight D In menstruating females absence of at least consecutive non synthetically induced menstrual cycles I can safely say I fit all that and went through all that all my years being anorexic and recovering although I am technically still in recovery How did I gain weight I started taking vitamins such as vitamin D C omega fish oil pills they are huge and hard to swallow centrum which is a women s multivitamin so men you guys should take the male one I also take iron supplements because it turns out I was also anemic low iron Eat whatever you want whenever you want A lot is convincing yourself it s okay to eat this and it s okay to splurge I remember I felt very guilty fat ugly gross I had tried throwing it all up even but that will just make you feel worse I used to eat and eat and eat until my stomach felt beyond full and I felt like throwing up but then pushed through and slept it off Eating more will make more space in your stomach so the feeling of being too full will be farther away and achieved by eating even more It s like tricking yourself into eating more eat greasy food the grease is fat and fat content is what you need to gain weight I ate a shit ton of junk food I also ate a shit ton of rice and beans and tofu and paneer and cheese Milk products white bread pastas candy chocolates on my period I would convince myself the chocolate was needed Don t work out I guess part of it was my depression but I didn t work out at all I used to do yoga but then I got injured and was unable and I noticed how much weight yoga actually burned and kept from me gaining weight So I have not been working out I ve just been letting the weight build up Make excuses to eat Breakfast is very important I found that I have a newfound love for everything bagels with a shit ton of butter and salt with iced coffee so everyday I eat that for breakfast Go out to eat I know not everyone can afford this but I mean like McDonald s or something if you buy the food yourself and see how much it actually cost you can convince yourself you have to eat it because you spent so much money on it Family and friends used to bully me and skinny shame me So many skinny jokes so many anorexic jokes and I was so fucking tired of it all so I was like you know what I ll show you They still make those jokes but not as much anymore Some say I ve gotten to a better weight and I m doing good My mom calls me fat when she gets mad and although I get mad at least she s not calling me bones anymore Anyway I hoped this helped or helps you guys snd doesn t get lost in new Again I m very thankful for the support and also thanks to the mod who removed creepy shit from my post I posted it at night and woke up in the morning to nothing but positivity,"['Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

I could have graduated this week but I ruined all my chances this is it for me I m doing itI ve been struggling with depression and social phobia for the last years and although suicidal thoughts have been recurrent this is the first time where I feel committed to it I have to hand in my graduation thesis by this Friday but I have not been able to type more than words these last months I am stuck at my parents house because of the outbreak and they have already told me that if I don t graduate they will not pay for me to return to college next year just to complete my thesis because they do not believe I will be able to The thought of having to drop out when I only have this one thing left makes me cry every time as I ve always had a lot of pressure regarding academics Even if I typed constantly for hours I will probably fail anyway as I have not kept in touch with my tutor due to my social phobia making it almost impossible for me to reach out even less when it s by email and this communication is a very big part of our grade This may sound like a stupid reason for ending it all but honestly when all your life revolves around academics and you know that you will lose all the opportunities that were waiting for you after graduation the future just seems like a dark void of nothingness I think that all this time I had just been looking for a good reason to actually kill myself and right now all I can think about is how big of a failure as a person I am Even my therapist has been pressuring me to finish my thesis and graduate and then focus on my problems during summer but I just cannot deal with all this pressure and all the negative thoughts that have been stopping me from being productive this last year So yeah I am ashamed but this is it Hopefully I can make this stop the fastest way possible Thank you for reading this and sorry for taking up your time You all deserve the best,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

My left arm has self harm scars that I have subconsciously trained myself to hide.I have scanned online forums for methods and now I find myself adding materials for my chosen method to my Amazon cart.I have had a desire to exit that has only grown with time.

Please help me make sense of my reality I don t know why I m writing this post except thatI m really really really in pain and on the verge of giving up I m years old I miss being myself being kind positive and bubbly I feel like the best parts of me are dead I also feel weak and fragile I grew up in a picture perfect family my dad was my best friend My biggest problem was losing weight and having a critical mom My parents had a great marriage my grandparents from my dad s side and from my mom s side were my biggest supporters I moved to a new country because my younger sister had autism spectrum disorder there was nothing in our country to support her so when I was my brother and my sister my mom left her job family and home to move to a developed country for my sister Apparently with therapy she could get better My dad remained back to work and support us abroad Financials this was when dad suddenly made it very big Also dad has a brother his wife my aunt and two children cousin is older than me and cousin is younger than my brother In the past year and a half these things have happened to me and these are the mistakes I made Dad started becoming distant Right after we left his mother conspired to get uncle to join my father s business uncle wasn t doing so well Mother was unhappy said she should just give him money Not have to work together As predicted by my mother and her mother fast forward years and Father is bankrupt with tonnes in the millions in debt that his brother took in his name Dad started a whole new business had everything on paper and handed it to uncle Slowly uncle got in more and more of his friends Father cannot and will not stand up to brother Every time he tries uncle calls his mother who calls my dad and psychologically abuses him SO much that my father gives in Father had to go to jail for a day for all this debt At one point dad was paying tuition for uncle s son while I was taking loans Extended family I grew up with as a result all hate dad now because he s not rich isn t giving them all free money owes them money Dad cheated on my mom this is ultimately what broke me in the years he had been away I watched their perfect beautiful marriage disintegrate Uncle and grandma probably really contributed to this I listened to mother cry on Skype for months like every other day straight What I would give to never have heard the stuff she said She read his text messages to other woman she also talked about her sexual life OMG She doesn t have many friends therapy is frowned upon in our culture so she cried to me And I listened Found out my grandfather dad s dad was a rapist He apparently approached my uncle s wife who then disconnected from my family As a result of which my grandma was so desperate for the two brothers to be working together Mom s mom is alone and struggling because she only had my mom and dad My dad hates her even though she tried to help him due to brainwashing from his own mother And my mother is incapable of being supportive so they have a conflict and I am stuck in between My mom s kidneys are not working like only percent so I ve been trying to convince her to take one of mine The constant implication is if she dies her two kids are my responsibility not her husbands My best friend who I was in love with broke up with his girlfriend And I took care of him We were pseudo dating everyone thought we were together I didn t want to push him because he just broke up RIGHT when my family fell apart he decides he met a girl in the library and loves her and they are dating He loves me but he loves her more because with me he does not feel carnal feelings I came to terms with the fact that I had been sexually assaulted as a child in my grandfather s house by a guy who worked there For years I kept thinking I wasn t pure and would never be enough for a guy A few days after this happened I think I was my grandmother mom s mom asked me if anyone had been near my vagina I said yes I don t know what she did after with this realization and the rejection I felt a lot of need to prove something to sex so I hooked up with guys and had sex with one off the internet He was nice and consensual made me feel good about myself but just dumped me as he got back with his girlfriend I started supporting myself more and more financially and it s been hard But I recognize it s worse for so many people TODAY haven t talked to dad properly in months I think he has PTSD cannot reconcile him and grandparents and uncle s family who loved me and supported me as a child Mom is dependant on me in some ways and its nice and suffocating I feel this weight on my shoulder of responsibility which I plan to take This is all that comes to mind I ve kept going because of good friends and this belief that if I keep working hard I ll get somewhere But recently my sister has been diagnosed with epilepsy and that made me so depressed As a child of immigrants I feel no identity Couldn t hold on to my religion lost all family back home don t fit in there when I go back home now the sexism pains and I feel like an outsider in my country where I ambling now which I feel will never accept me as me Please give me some perspective articles or tangible advice I m struggling so much SO MUCH TLDR Bankruptcy familial estrangement sexual assault sick mother infidelity in family heartbreak Identity crisis as an immigrant and a lot of pressure to take responsibility of siblings I m finding it difficult to keep going,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive

Ugh nd attempt because of some stupid reason So i had bought a new gun toy with my own money but since my grandmother doesn t really care about me having my own fun I had to hide it for a day A few minutes ago she was knocking on my door so i put it under my bed She then walked in and asked what was going on I told her nothing because I didn t want her to know She then realized this was an opportunity to get me in trouble so then she changed the subject to what I had on my computer I had just recently restarted it so I was opening all my tabs again Including Part of a Marvel s Avengers playthrough I clicked away from it because I hate how they can t give me privacy always asking what I m watching Like please shut up She thought I was talking to someone i wasn t supposed to because the guy had a facecam I had to tell her It was a video and I couldn t talk to a video At this point I m pissed because she always does this My grandfather then got involved and since i can somewhat trust him I told him i had to hide the gun he then understood and the situation died down But he did threaten I m going to make sure your father goes through your history like really That was before told him about the gun I hate this house so much,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"chronic pains from chronic anxiety for the past few months iâ€™ve been dealing with chronic pain that seems to move around my body primarily in my feetâ€”especially the heelsâ€”and deep buttocks pain that feels like its within the bones they sometimes switch almost never at the same time 
 
 iâ€™ve undergone numerous doctor visits countless blood tests and several scans yet everything seems to check out okay healthwise a physical therapist ruled out fibromyalgia but suggested that the pain might be linked to chronic stress and anxiety
 
 adding to this ive been grappling with intense fatigue not sleepiness sporadically which complicates things further
 
 this has been an incredibly challenging journey especially because the pain persists and impacts my daily life making it difficult to walk at times its become evident that its not just physical its linked to my mental health however i have dealt well with my anxiety and do not have almost any anxiety feelings or symptomts for months now if anything the pains started after my month long anxiety flare up
 
 iâ€™m curious if anyone here has experienced something similarâ€”chronic pain seemingly from chronic anxiety or stressâ€”and if so how did you cope did you find any strategies that helped alleviate the pain or manage it better over time how long did it take and where were the pains exactly in your body

I m literally hopeless and will end my life in a few daysYes I fucking am There is no hope for me I m sick rn not covid tho and despite that will cut myself anyway I ve lived in a mental hospital for two years I have tried all the kind of therapies they specifically have to offer I m sixteen and we already started trying antidepressants for adults bc I tried the ones that kids are allowed to get already Nothing worked I am almost at the highest dose and after that they can t help me try other ones bc they don t have enough experience My problems are now too complex and heavy for them and they have no other options for me to try therapies again I ve already had for years without success I told them over two months ago I wanted to switch completely and go to another place where they have more therapies and meds I can try and where they are completely focused on ppl like me With chronic severe and complex problems Because at the place I m treated at rn that s just very often not the case so they really lacked acute and good help the first few months They told me they would talk ab it with my parents and me TWO MONTHS later and I told them everything was getting worse and to be able to go in conversation with them my mental health shouldn t worsen I asked them for more temporarily more intense help but they never came back to me so i was left with medication appointments and therapy sessions that didn t help And as i thought everything took a turn for the absolute worst I got worse and worse and i was falling back in all of my bad behaviors and coping mechanisms I cut deeper than ever before didn t do anything and started interacting with my anorexia again that had actually been pushed away and not that bad for the past few months I had the convo a few days ago I didn t want anything because i wanted to die more than ever They said they needed me if i wanted other therapy I told them i didn t want it anymore and i wanted to die They suggested i got admitted to the mental hospital again which is basically of my trauma s I got mad They know that Some of staff treaded me very poorly and multiple friends died there literally doors away from my room They forced me to go inpatient after that and i begged them to send me to another hospital if i had to be on a closed ward everything was better than there But that was too complicated for them So yeah when i got discharged because they couldn t fix me i swore i wouldn t go back ever So they told me if i wanted to be admitted somewhere else i could wait six months Nice thanks Its always so funny they tell me that when i say i want to die and tell them alright fine i ll fk die than And actually attempt And then somehow they have the courage to say wow we were unpleasantly surprised and didn t see this coming LMFAO and THEN i am suddenly transported as soon as im physically ok to the first closed ward with watch Sorry for rhis long rant with bad english I just am so done I tried to tell them i was not ok I tried to ask for help two months ago and again two days ago The only thing bringing me some peace in my mind are self harm and my cat And i tried to hold on for my cat because she means everything to me and for everyone that loves me because i know damn well what its like to lose ppl to suicide But i can t I can t i just can t I can t go to school next year I can t go on a waiting list of six months and i can t go on this way My plan takes multiple days unfortunately and it started yesterday so i have to wait spend my time cuddling with my cat and self harming I doubt wether i should tell my best friend we have an agreement that if the other will end it we will say goodbye and not inform anyone until after I don t wanna lay the burden on her shoulders but otherwise I would ve give everything to have had a chance to say go the ppl i lost I would ve kept it a secret if it meant i could be on the phone with them until they passed I can t bare the idea of them having been so alone God that haunts me the most Knowing they were all alone when they died I don t know guess that s gonna be the last harsh decision to make,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Dear reddit after taking a look at my life I realized that I have no one to talk to and that I was instead the one others come to for solace and comfort so now that I need that there are none who are willing to offer it I have nobody not even the person who shares mutual love with me wishes to spend some time with me and at least hear me out now because of my mood Speaking of moods I m in a fairly dangerous one Not for others mind you I don t believe in harming other people for no good reason My mood is hazardous to my own health Most days I m suicidal anyway but most days I have some level of hesitation or disinterest in death and serious issues with pain Today I find myself quite lacking in caution self preservation instinct and the ability to care whether or not I live or die On top of all this I have work in about hours and I m not even sure I can make it all the way there without dying spectacularly EDIT Oh right lest we forget the biggest reason I can t talk to anyone is because they re all as messed up as I am and adding to their worries will only cause more of a headache for me and is exactly the same as adding to my own problems especially if I decide to stick around It s a crappy loop that screws me over time,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I m a failure and a disappointment When there s nothing left but guilt why continue I ve always said that I would kill myself if life got too hard I don t believe in god or an afterlife so it always seemed like the right thing to do My life philosophy has been to enjoy myself and if that s no longer possible what s the point I am everything I don t want to be I m a year old college dropout virgin living in my mom s basement working for my dad buried in debt and getting high everyday I got myself into credit card debt in my time in college and because I m capable of making long term plans but incapable of following them in the short term it s not gotten any better I ve spent the last two years with the active goal of getting out of credit card debt and I m exactly where I was when I started I d be worse off if I hadn t already hit my credit limit I m sure But this isn t about money This is about guilt I have let down everyone I know and love on so many occasions that they have lost faith in me And rightly so I m flakey If I promise to do something I might do it If only my conscience would let me live like that I feel terrible every time I go back on my word every time I so much as suspect that I ve let someone down The only thing that has kept me going till now was the constant deep feeling of guilt Is that any way to live I have no self motivation I can t do anything unless someone s breathing down my neck about it Left to my own devices I get high play video games masturbate and sleep Wake up rinse repeat I let my lizard starve and dehydrate to the point that when I finally tried to give him water he was so weak he drowned in it I got a puppy with my previous roommate and we neglected him until he took off one day and got hit by a car And that was the better fate for him Two weeks ago I skipped an entire week of work I haven t gone to work since Thanksgiving now I m an embarrassment to my dad he wants me to do well he tries to push me but I don t respond I haven t said a word to him since Sunday not even to tell him I won t be coming in Because then I d feel worse and I m a coward I have a sense of responsibility but no willpower so my commitments end in disappointment for all and guilt for myself Somewhere along the line I failed to learn basic human social skills I can t carry a conversation I get scared and can t describe my ideas to anyone I m reading a book you ask me about it I give you a dismissive answer and go back to reading not because I m an asshole but because you scare the shit out of me I m terrified of touching people anything from an attention getting poke to a hug Hell I can t even say people s names because it feels wrong Because of all this it takes a huge amount of effort for me to even be in social situations let alone try to talk to people I end up isolated by choice and hating myself for it So that s what it comes down to I m a selfish loathsome person and I hate myself for it I feel nothing but guilt and self loathing except when I m escaping through drugs and entertainment The only thing stopping me from killing myself now is figuring out the best method and who to leave notes for EDIT I drove around today looking for a good place to jump from but couldn t find one I spent the rest of the day in a weed fueled haze at a friend s house almost entirely quiet drifting in and out of consciousness Then as I was coming home I pulled into a cemetery and spent the next hour holding a knife to my throat and listing the reasons I had to die But obviously I couldn t do it I called my therapist to schedule an appointment as soon as possible Clearly my antidepressant is no longer cutting it I m going to talk to my mom about my attempt tomorrow morning and my dad at work I hope for the best with that Thanks everyone who posted This morning I was sure this was my last day I m not sure how long I ll keep at it but you ve given me the strength to try for a while longer,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is treating to commit suicideI am not sure this is the right sub reddit to post it to I do not know what to do at this stage and I hope this helps somehow Apologies for the long post I had started working at a company where I M met K M We soon were best buddies and after a couple of months he confessed he was gay Now he is not the type of guy you would suspect he is gay In fact he is not out and he tries his best to keep it a secret This is the source of a lot of frustration and stress in his life A thing which most people will attribute to him being a shy person Furthermore hHe has never had a relationship and I am the only guy who knows He has his personal issues why he doesn t want to come out but mostly it is because he is not attracted to the type of guys you see in LGBT parades However I did manage to convince him to seek professional help which he still is continuing on getting Honestly when he first told me about his secret I tried my best to be laid back about it I continued to treat him as I would treat any best friend Admittedly I may have crossed the line occasionally by commenting love you or xx I guess from him end he was interpreting this as being more than just friends However I naively saw nothing wrong in that Thing is he does not believe that my intentions were honest and that I was never interested in him Because of this we have been constantly fighting and it has come to a point were I cannot mention my SO He stopped going out with his friends and I am the only friend he goes out with Whilst I enjoy his company many times it feels like I have to take him out because he is so lonely This is something I had always discouraged but was always helpless in avoiding He is now treating to kill himself because he wants to see me since we are not meeting often He always had suicidal thoughts but he is treating to do it since he has lost all the reason to live for since he does not have me any longer in his life I am mortified because on one hand I wish to help him but on the other hand I know that I AM the problem On one hand I wish to keep him in my life but on the other hand I know that our friendship cannot go any longer like this One thing I failed to mention is that I have never spoke to my SO about this and this is also having serious repercussions on my conscience I feel guilty because I am keeping such a secret from her but on the other hand I cannot break my promise to my friend I honestly do not know what to do Did I do something wrong Any helpful suggestions will be greatly appreciated Thanks TL DR Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is threatening to commit suicide,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Getting to be too muchI gave up on the antidepressants I was taking about half a year ago because they made certain parts of my life dull and numb and at the time I was in a long distance relationship with a girl who was great at understanding my problems and making me feel like she genuinely cared about me About a month or so ago she broke up with me without warning two weeks before we had plans to meet because she had met someone else and she couldn t be with me anymore Obviously this hurt me and left me scrambling and aimless but I ve been doing my best not to let it dominate me and trying to pick myself back up I switched to new antidepressants a week ago because I ve been slipping worse and worse and thinking suicidal thoughts for hours every night at work or home This morning it got so bad I looked up information on my antidepressants in order to find out if I could overdose on them and I ve thought about it four or five times since then I think I m still okay because I haven t tried anything yet and the antidepressants haven t had enough time to do their work but it s scaring me more and more Look I know everyone s got relationship troubles and I know it hurts like hell I know my problems aren t special and I can t pretend they are But I ve struggled my whole life with relationships I m and I haven t been intimate with anyone And every time I get close to someone friend or romantic interest they push me away Every person I ve called a best friend cut contact with me Every romantic interest despite what they would say were not willing to actually be with me I don t know why It became a fear of mine being abandoned by people I cared about and my ex was wonderful to me for many reasons but she alleviated that fear She actually got through my depression and made me feel cared about and I felt really healthy and like I was making progress because of her And then to just be cut off again without warning to have her do to me exactly what I was afraid of happening despite knowing I was afraid of that it s like none of that healthiness and happiness mattered I mean I was suicidal before but now I don t know how much more I can take I still have immediate goals but it s becoming excruciating to get through day after day like this I just want to get over it to not feel like such a fucking failure with people and with myself and focus on other goals for now but I m not letting myself I just want to have someone close to me again I just want to feel like someone cares again Half the reason I m writing this is to just get it out of my system I think it worked because I m crying hahaha but thank you if you took the time to read it Some words of encouragement would mean the world to me but don t feel pressured to say anything Thank you so much,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I just called a crysis hotline what a waste of time and tearsI don t want to make a new reddit account because I tried to last time I wanted to post and ended locked out of the site and it was just a nightmare so ya don t wreck my life and find out who i am I just called a crysis hotline and it was busy lol and I called more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times then I found another line for some local crysis centre i used to work as a telephone surveyer it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell special one time offer how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you actually that sounds terrible I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can t see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem so basically I am alone I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares it s all up to you she says wow what a thing to say to someone with depression yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me i know that my life is either shitty or it isn t based off my actions I very much know that why would I be depressed if I didn t blame myself just fucking terrible now I m just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal it s like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house well I work fulltime so that s not gonna work and I don t have vacation days and I work nights so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever well that s not really gonna work if I get up at pm and go to bed at noon pm so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life I actually don t mind my job I actually like it there it s the one safe spot in the world is work I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since but I know it s not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all and then it s just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house but why don t I just move out well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn t work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I ve maxed out my credit cards paying them rent which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out I didn t even ask them to change their habits I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration so now I m stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt I m not even hopelessly in debt I just can t leave here but I can t live being this fat anymore because nobody will love me or even even affectionitly touch me I don t even mean sex I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female you know I don t even blame them for regecting me anymore they all actually out of their way nice to me so ya whatever I guess I m taking some art classes and I found out I m very talented lol I m a very honest person in a way that s great on camera But I m fat and people don t have sympathy for fat people well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss if you just try to put them in a normal life situation people inheritly react negatively because fat people are ugly I think it too but ya I can t fix it I know people won t accept this statement but when I m on my healthy diet I feel great and am not hungry because it s well balanced and not extremely low calorie But I come home from work and it s just there is food and sugar everywhere and as soon I get eating it I want more and then i don t care because I think I ve already fucked it up for myself I might as well just eat more so I don t feel bad and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won t seem like unenjoyable effort and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don t want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get double cheeseburgers and each has calories that s calories I can eat in I dunno stop lights away from the mcdonalds and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs on top of the regular diet which is about under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around then all of a sudden I m like calories over my needs and then that s evey day and that s like all in the last hours of the day and the next day maybe I just don t care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two calorie energy drinks and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash it s just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself but if I ever try to just anything just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction I know we re in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don t hate me because I act like I think you hate me but it s not because you hate me it s because I love yes I know I don t know what the word means but I like to use it you and you ll regect me and it s easier for me to perceive it as hate and you go out of your way to say it isn t and you care that little bit and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it s just this natural reaction and attraction no desperation there isn t time to get desperate and you just say I m gonna play it cool and later maybe do something and then you get home and you remember I m almost pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she ll regect you like everyone else because you ve done that that same thing has happend dozens of times and you ve played it out like groundhogs day where you ve done every possible thing reacted everyway tried everything including not trying and it has all ended the same you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym years ago and I m actually in pretty good shape I m just really really fat I lifting and flexibility and I cycle even though it s really hard being so fat and I got down to I m which the lightest I ve been in ever even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage the first time I ve been under bmi since I ve remember checking my weight and now in months I ve thrown away all of it and gained lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food mostly it was always an issue always adding a few hundred calories here and there and now it s like you can sell everything you own get your debt to a controlable level and move out but I have to move walking distance from work because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there vechiles to work after they moved and took me with them it was a mistake to move out with them but I would have no car and I couldn t take my art classes or even have access to a gym because there isn t one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in thin ice around some shores and I m not tryhing to violate the rules it s just it seemed like a good idea I was just gonna jump and swim to shore if I could make it and that seemed like a good idea then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something I dunno it seemed lik e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone but whatever I m really tired now and I just want someone I dunno there is nothing I know nobody can help me the things I want that will make me happy I can t ask and don t have any right to ask but crying makes me tried and I don t like having to hear myself crying wouldn t be so bad if I didn t have to hear the whale it s like someone else it s like I m hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me I m just thinking wrong reacting wrong I just don t interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over or go to therapy for and all of this will start over again tomorrow but it ll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I ll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I ll be happy that s what I have to look forward to the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental

Dear my friends who read this and everyone else Hi I m James You have never met me or will likely never do so I am a depressed year old boy who is trapped in life and a viscous circle It started at the ripe old age of Entering Year th grade I always knew adjusting into a secondary school wouldn t be the easiest but hell I tried getting on with everyone It seem some people just don t get along I was average weight for a guy my size and was always healthy Now however is no longer the case You see bullying destroyed me Not in the sense of mentally where i just lost it one day and lashed out No it literally picked my life apart and my future bit by bit The person i was back in Year th grade no longer exists I was happy looking ahead to what could be an amazing life with a nice enough personality likeability and body to go with it But that changed I got along well with the group of friends I joined in the second year of my secondary school Though we were classified as I suppose the nerdy ones Up to this point everything was fine That is when I was destroyed forever past present and future I started to get bullied then again so do a lot of kids but it affected me more than others For months I would take the bullying and abuse shrugging it off but I was comfortable I started eating more and more to feel safe it was my little thing i always held close food It was like an anti bullying anti depressant for me it was weird but nevertheless what comes with eating more food is weight I started gaining weight out of control I went from this little lbs kid to over lbs in a matter of a couple months I could no longer run hell even jog By mid end of Year I was heavily obese with asthma problems But i wouldn t run or exercise in general because i was still made fun out of You know fat fuck running to loose some weight yeah I was but I said i was just going somewhere and would just stop running Moving on i was bullied through my schooling more and more Still gaining more and more weight by the start of Year it was Suddenly noticed by a relatively new teacher a teacher who came to be a saving grace Though too little to late a saving grace nevertheless This teacher we ll call him John saw me gaining weight eating way more than i should getting told off for eating in class or slagging off daydreaming probably about killing myself or how much better my life would be somewhere else Now in the UK year is the final year for schooling so it was highly important to revise for exams and get through the school day This I could not do hell I couldn t even get to school without being out of breath or faking an illness to get a day away John finally gave in and gave me the rest of the year off to revise for exams and get prepared for the end of the year I never did prepare i slept my days away glad that i would never have to go back apart from exams where i was separated from the people who destroyed my life I did my exams and failed most of them Completing my schooling This was the best thing that had ever happened to me leaving this place Though it still lived on in my head and heart killing me every time i thought about it Even to this day if i have to walk past or drive past the school i end up in tears over the time i spent there The only person i have to thank in my life the only person who cared Who gave a damn The only person who loved me like a brother Who saw the pain the suffering The times i said i wanted to kill myself Wo then went and told John the person who saved me more than anyone else could My friend Niall He is part of my little family My true saving grace Months of grief even after leaving the school i kept saying i was ok even though dying inside I luckily got accepted into a college that i did fine at I stopped eating as much though Still way more than i should I was left alone there i didn t know anyone made no friends and was alone THIS is where everything stopped being about the bullying and the shit i was given at my last school But inside i knew they caused me to be overweight and not great to look at So now i was lonely and sunk into deep depression a depression i never uttered a word about for years I dropped out of my college for personal issues and had months off Still obtaining a good grade from that college i moved into another one immediately as the next school year turned over Thinking i was over from all this shit thought everything was ok after my months off It was not i entered the new college where there were girls everywhere with boyfriends being happy my mind slipped back into a state of horrific depression worse than anything else I started eating more and more again on top of that i was still lonely with know one i know attending this college either After weeks at the college i cracked to my parents i cried for hours that day pouring years of abuse and depression all at once but never once uttering i was lonely because the way to deal with it is loose weight and become healthy young guy again become who i wanted to be since i was that little th grader But i knew that i was never going to be that person so i decided what i was going to do But that would have to wait First i went to my doctor who put me on the SSRI Citalopram i was taking mg for weeks to no effect I was then moved up to mg and i was sent to emergency youth counselling I was there for weeks once a week Telling this woman everything about me and what went on not once crying or hurting It was just nice to feel free telling someone that was going to tell know one else about the real side of my depression After the first week i told my closest friend Niall about the real side of me everything I continued on with counselling as did my depression The Citalopram didn t work After weeks i told my councillor that i was fine and that she helped a lot But she knew that i wasn t fine I started to self harm and drink making myself more depressed and wallowing in self pity I went out a lot of times one month with friend told not to drink But i still did I self harmed more and more Then the best thing that ever happened in my life came up It was a weekend in mid April A weekend i was looking forward to no special event i just was Niall invited me to an anime convention Now i wasn t even an anime fan I d only ever watched Gurren Lagann but i went along and for that one weekend i was free I was happy i had camera round my neck and by GOD did i abuse it I used it as an excuse to talk to people Girls mostly I got more love and affection in that one weekend than i did in my entire life I was truly not alone or unhappy I had people notice the cuts all down my arm being only a day or old they were raised and red Rather easy to see Though know one questioned them and for that i was happy That one weekend was the best days of my life Thank you for that Niall After that i was next sent to the doctor weeks after initial counselling ended The doctor saw my wounds and suggested i go to a psychiatrist So naturally i did still on the citalopram so at this point i was still depressed The psychiatrist put me on a new drug called Mirtazapine i was in mg of the stuff for weeks and it did a hell of a lot more than the citalopram ever did I was feeling better I wasn t depressed but i was still a bit lonely Now i not usually the one to beg people or bother them but the only other assistance i had stopping me killing myself was music this artist in particular being Veela one night i sent her this email http i imgur com PPbHq png I didn t expect a reply from her being as popular as she is I mean she made some pretty popular music http www youtube com watch v HzBL nK Zo among the gaming community To my surprise she did Not by a simple little email either she went out of her way to record me a video http www youtube com watch v sdTfm LzHXk amp feature youtu be which was attached to a tiny email simply saying lt http i imgur com Eizlr png Now i was super excited that i got some love from some relatively unknown Canadian girl I was extremely happy I am much happier now and I m grateful for my friends that i have and for Veela keeping my little boat afloat some

Things are not going amazing in my life at the moment, but also not particularly bad, either.

Nobody in my family deals with any mood disorders, so they are not very understanding when i do go through slumps, so i feel like I am not taken seriously and no one truly understands how bad i feel.I also do not want to try therapy again for the simple fact that i cannot afford it. I make too much for Medicaid, and even with good insurance i was paying almost $300 out of pocket, twice a month, just for therapy alone, not including my general appointments for my medication.I really only have 3 people i can talk to. One being my boyfriend of 6 years, who is supportive and as helpful as he can be, but given the fact hes never struggled with it himself, he does not really understand. The other is my best friend who is honestly not the greatest friend in general, and i feel like i bother her when i talk to her.

Watch Bottom Tier Nozaki Kun I got up at pm today after a heavy night of gaming and decided to check out some of the new seasonal shows One caught my attention Bottom Tier Tomozaki Kun It would be insufficient to say that the show changed my life Being a gamer myself I too looked at life like it was a horrid thing and that the only saving grace of living was gaming But watching the first episode of this show really ignited the gamer in me Thinking of life like an easy to learn difficult to master game really opened my eyes to going outside I haven t left the house for around weeks now but I think today I might step out into the world as a level one player and Ill keep going till I get Grandmaster rank I m This show is truly inspiring and my only show Go watch it Gamers,"['Positive Coping', 'Mood Tracking']",low

survived attempt last year feel Death laughing in my face ever sinceprobably attempt or was last year lost count when i moved to the city haven t died died soo idk if its even considered attempting just hard failing hahaha havent slept so this will probably be ranting Got a sous job felt great started to feel alienated hosts werent listening chefs weren t listening i just felt over whelmed like what the fuck am i even doing in a kitchen whatever it s not like they even called my ICE contacts to check on me so pfft lets die ok boom lets go I think at the time I woke up again and just started dying I just felt weak like I would probably bust my head on the way to the bathroom I remember wanting to die but just panicking bc i knew that this would just end really badly I took somewhere between and hundred pills of zquil tylenol advil pms And all I could think of in the moment was fuck No anti nausea meds dumbass so I start blowing chunks obvs lost my pill count I knew if anything I just fucked up my system and it s going to be long ass week I remember smiling at whoever intubated me bc I knew it was all fucked stuck in icu for a few days but i enjoyed it my dreams were the scariest but turned into the most beautiful things after i m guessing a few days I really hoped in my heart of hearts that I was at least in purgatory I wake up to find a friend at my feet I didn t want that I wanted everyone gone I didn t tell anyone bc I really just wanted to die y ya How did this turn into a whole thing I didn t want her there or SOs mom looking at me as i lay passed out I just felt more alone with everyone Even Sos friend knew i wouldnt have minded but they stayed over like the next month and i could just feel quiet judgement or at least weird quiet no one talked about it but his friend and his SO knew his friends SO said she was glad I was ok before they left after the weekend Fucking slutbag idk u or your bf but you both are balls deep in my business ok anyway I remember waking up again on one to one but I had my phone I looked up my balance to check my deposits and either my balance was or was missing I think it was supposed to be around something or almost I bring it up to SO who got defensive saying so much was going on and he was worried MTG games Beer Cigarettes thats where the cash went He said cleaning but there was still friggin nyquil goo on the floor and the trash wasn t taken out when I got back from the loony bin call me heartless but idk i was out for a few days and hundo was gone lol how would it have been if i just died like So i was supposed to see a friend after it all almost died near Katz deli light said walk and I was inches away from getting it by a produce bus that ran the light and I felt so alive now I just wished i took a fucking step real quick I wanted to think there was a reason I was here that it was the universe saying I was leaving on her terms or not at all Go to this place to wait waited almost an hour for my friend to come by while the waiter ignored me which I guessed made me feel smaller than most times Ah well still alive but since then it feels all downhill Lost touch with that galpal but we were both sad I felt like sometimes she did things to make me feel smaller but also feel like its just the fear of inadequacy telling me that I do feel like she took me to a dark place that was unnecessary though I felt wasn t allowed to really have problems there was someone else who had something terrible happen couldnt visit or call the loony bin bc she was busy then why be over me in icu with ur sister who doesnt even know me But at a certain point I felt like she always wanted to be the little wounded deer everyone helped but refused help bc she was too tuff She talked about how certain people resented her and how shitty everyone was but I feel like she was a mean girl on the low Like she has called me crying she has been to my house at godless hours bc she was alone i have literally dressed her wounds we were thicc thieves together for a minute then I guess I got too much Always late to see me not texting for days not really asking about me and I felt like the one always seeking approval and I felt she liked that bc she also felt shit Or maybe she was too depressed for friendship and maybe i m just a needy piece of shit Alone now so who is really laughing SO has been supporting me on and off bc I can t hold a job anymore I think a few months before my big job he kept saying how I can t hold a job idk it was in an argument and now I really can t Both drank and argued a lot think it calmed officially a couple of months ago once I officially lost income for my own hard stuff Right now he is playing fortnite Before he took a nap at he was also playing it And yesterday Yes Also playing We went to the store yesterday and just holding the basket not talking about anything not discussing anything he just took time off work to get a different job and I feel like I am good bc I am convenient I gave up my lease to be with him and now I feel like it s an obligation to take care of the things he can t won t because he supports me and is happy with me sometimes I feel like he s just been accustomed to having a plus one it s not like a partner I have no one and no where to go no money and no income as unhealthy as we are together sometimes he is all I have here aside from immediate family he talks to sometimes I feel like I am also his only friend sometimes i don t want to die I just want to go far away so he can develop on his own He doesn t get depression and I remember even throwing a noose I made at him he was shocked and we stopped arguing that night but guess where that noose is still on my dresser and we live in a studio wild I ve had terminations and one miscarriage st was bc of my new job which was a simple choice save up and start then the second I had been home from hospital for a little over a month the last one I got a pill to finish bc I was but it was gone already He doesn t want to be a father he said yes the last time but it was so scared and hollow i just had to go with my gut and went to the doc for the news and I don t think we should raise a child who will grow up around resentment im a foster kid so tbh i would rather be a single mom but that was a whole thing so I can t see myself having his child and remaining happy for the next year even still think what would have happened had I just hit the road and started my own thing for me and my kid think I wouldve been a good mom my dad friend keeps telling me to make moves to get back into painting but I wasnt even great at I don t want anymore tiring adventures It seems so pointless I m not even sure if direction is necessary anymore I feel like I can t find my footing I m fucking tired of the kitchen but i ve been here since I was it s all I am I feel if you re not planning on being a chef you ll be a linecook forever while there s no shame in an honest job I feel like I wanted more from this life I wanted to dream and I feel like I dreamt too big I feel like Death is laughing at me and just waiting for me to fully get it through that I am alone i feel like anyone s attempts to help are meant to sate their own senses of fulfillment no one knows me no one really cares,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping',

You don t have to read this it s too long I could care less and or more but I have little actual life in meThis is just another one of those days Another meaningless effort to socialise and be part of the collective without drawing attention Of course my mind wasn t going to let this down Multiple professionals have diagnosed depression and Asperger s but only fairly recently I feel like shit on a solid majority of the day and always turn to memes and videos to distract myself I have a pretty dark humour and enjoy abusing it to shock those around me which inevitably pushes them away Obviously I take my choices in practicing that abuse Main focus is a nihilistic approach at things with an affinity for factuality Our existence is meaningless null and void until we ourselves make the difference But I never could bring myself to do it The closer I get to real life and all it entails the more I try to reject it both sub and conciously I am repulsed by the idea of having to struggle even a bit so that I could continue living at a satisfying point I have little idea what real ward work is and never planned on finding out years of age seem long enough since I kept hating myself for about a third of them and thought I wouldn t last before high school graduation I have gone to several doctors all while aiming to fight back against my instinct to deny their help Taken pills drugs of different kinds anti ts could only do so much Because of the afforementioned and in addition to an enjoyable imagination I find human life to be uninteresting and lacking of a specific charm so I would always wonder why we aren t endowed with more fascinating abilities that have been concieved recorded and shared through hundreds of thousands of beloved stories I keep fantasizing about the big what kind of answer I would give to an offer of wishes and go over it again and again trying to perfect the phrasing the expression the absolute perfect way to request my most deepest desires to the dumbass higher power that has the ability to grant them while incapable of understanding them completely Ultimately I feel like scum for living in my own head more than on the outside although I refuse to do anything to change it I deserve not what was given to me from birth and if only I didn t care about the people i ve interacted with just enough so I despise the idea of potentially hurt anyone at the news of my death I would have already left,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I think I just made suicidal gesture Okay So I m in grad school and it really sucks I m really not into the idea of going into academia but I don t want to quit I love my discipline and let s be real I have nothing else going for me That said I can t stand my peers or the faculty I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further given the cost I got into a language program that would be great for my CV but financially speaking I just can t afford to support myself through the summer Outside of loans I m on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don t do this I will not get my degree My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning I have no clue what to do I don t want to give up my degree but I really really HATE my program If I stay I ll be miserable if I go I ll hate myself for quitting I know what your thinking but transferring in grad school is easier said than done Last night I got into a really big argument with my parents It wasn t so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself A few hours later after I got done studying I was really upset I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it So I took my belt off fastened it around my neck tied it to a rack in my closet not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head but either I didn t think it would work or I chickened out I don t really know which it was I took it off and just went to bed So I guess my question is did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it I don t want my parents to worry about me I don t want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation But I also don t think this is something I should brush under the rug,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Hi I m not feeling too hot I know it s common to feel depressed once in a while but today I m actually starting to scare myself I saw a reddit ad yesterday said something like help the DREAM act pass or something like that So i went to comments and all i see is just Hate The DREAM act is supposed to help illegal immigrants get a work visa or something Well that s pretty much how everything started If you haven t guessed by now I m illegal i guess I am an illegal human being Wow kinda feels good letting that out That s good i was hoping this venting would make me feel better Anyway I was brought here when i was years old i had no choice on the matter Now I m still in the same situation I don t have shit for rights can t get a driving license can t get into college because i don t have a ssn always trying to dodge the police but hey they make sure i get a number to file taxes every year so i can pay up because supposedly I make too much But that doesn t matter almost years of living this way kinda sucked My childhood and teenage years were stained by all of it I was always too scared to go to parties in case they got busted or something like that or just scared of going out in general Because of this i was never able to keep many friends i would always just blow them off because i was just scared of getting in trouble Till this day its just the way i am full of anxiety and self pity i guess Back to the ad maybe I m preaching to the wrong choir here It was just full of hate Uninformed people just talking about a subject they have no clue about We re labeled as criminals and selfish we re seeing as rats I don t want to be here either man But what do you want me to do Go back to my own country The country i have almost no memory of I am just as American as you are the only difference is that I m shit and wasn t as lucky to be born here I m miserable here I love this country i love its people but I m not allowed here I m not going to say everything else is perfect but i feel like this is the root of all my anxiety and depression Well there was another pretty big bump in my life I had met a beautiful girl we clicked right away after about two weeks we started dating i like to think that i was truly happy with her There was a problem she had drug issues that she was overcoming I had no idea how to deal with all that i didn t know how bad heroin withdrawals were i was just ignorant of the whole subject Time passed by and everything was good i felt like i loved her we always joked because when she came out to me about being former drug addict i told her that i was an illegal immigrant so we both stunned each other that day it felt great because finally somebody i trusted knew about my situation and she reacted positive to it I think that really strengthen our relationship Well long story short everything that is good dies She relapsed took too much i guess and overdosed leading to her death It s been two years and i still can t help to feel guilty A person on that state of mind shouldn t be dating a relationship can be stressful a recovering drug addict shouldn t be put under even more stress Damn i sure spilled my guts here Well i honestly don t have a motivation to live anymore I just don t feel like i have the strength to wake up in the morning if it wasn t for work i could sleep for like hours straight lol I know life is a precious thing and some people have it much worse but i just don t want to deal with it anymore i give up They say God never hands you more than you can handle so i can more than likely get through with this but i don t want too I m tired I originally wrote this because i was seriously considering driving off a bridge on my way back from work i don t think I will be doing that anymore So i guess this helped I m going to stop writing now because im tearing up and i can barely see my computer screen lol Sorry i made it so long i just wanted to vent Good luck to all you guys going through the same thoughts You probably shouldn t do it though And to the lurkers seriously type up your problems and send them venting makes you feel so much better maybe it just changes your mind Sorry about the grammar and shit Take care SW,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

What does seeing a doctor about depression actually do for you I m not really at the suicidal level yet and if I ever were I have a plan in place that would take years to finish anyhow I m not sure if this is the right place for this then but I ve been wondering about what seeing a doctor for depression and getting a diagnosis will actually do for you I ve never talked to my doctor about mental issues but from my experiences and looking at the symptoms I m fairly certain I would be classified as having some form of chronic depression dysthymia and or cyclothymia possibly venturing into a major depression at times It s been this way for years and at times I wonder about asking a doctor about it but I always think back and figure Well what good is that going to do If I was offered a card referral to some counselor I don t think I d be very interested in going I don t have the time nor the money to dedicate to something like that and even if I did I think I would be so against the idea of talking it out to someone about problems that it wouldn t be very effective I know it s a mental issue so it s not like there is some magic pill or surgery that takes care of it I just feel like I d start a process of being thrown to an endless cycle of therapy and counseling So what purpose would there be to seeing a doctor or would there not be any,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
"Hi there, I would very much like to talk to anyone who has done or is doing Transference focused practice for BPD or other issues. I have tried it but haven't found a therapist who is a good fit yet and would also very much appreciate any names of therapists (any area) since it's so difficult to find TFP specialists.
 
 I know TFP is supposed to be a challenging and non-supportive therapy, but so far I've found it very difficult, at times I honestly have felt like I'm going crazy (perhaps from the inherent message you get that you don't know reality as well as the therapist) but I really don't want to self-sabotage and quit.
 
 In case it's interesting to hear my experience, I've briefly seen a female therapist in Mexico who disappeared when she didn't have availability and a man currently in the U.S. who has made me uncomfortable by repeatedly asking me about my sex life (mostly at the beginning but it's hard now because I don't feel I can discuss similar topics since I've been pressured) and who at times comes off as sarcastic, he has no Google reviews but was the only person I could find and is in my neighborhood but all my TFP sessions have been online so I'm happy to talk to anyone in the world.
 
 I'd also love to have an actual phone (or at least text) conversation with someone doing TFP so we could support each other going through it.","['Seeking Help', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update']",medium

"attend a business trip while starting new medication tldr i should be going on a business trip for 4 days with a colleague tomorrow and started new medication bupropione 2 days ago im really stressing out about the trip and dont know whether to got or not
 
 so i have very bad health anxiety since the february similar problems years ago but thats another story probably due to stress since im moving in another country for work next month stress gives me tension headaches and that leads to me thinking i have brain cancer and whatnot
 
 however since march im in a small startup until end of next month for the next funding round we got a business trip this week one of our ceos couldnt attend since shes busy otherwise therefore i am the only option left to go with our other ceo and also a friend of mine since 3 years the organizer specifcally required two people and one is not enough for whatever reason 
 
 i was really stressing out about this since small meeting directly put me into fight or flight lately last week i made a spontaneous visit at a psychiatrist who describwd me 150mg bupropione he told me side effects are not very relevant and i should start right away rather than wait for the business trip to be over the medication relieved my depression but anxiety is unchanged and i wake up at night with panic 
 
 like this i really just dont want to go on a business trip but canceling everything would mean that my colleague has to go alone 
 
 i cant decide what to do disappoint my colleagues and cringe because i have to tell them about my mental health issues or suffer really hard for a few days hoping i get no major panic attacks

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

A letter to my grandmother Hey just a warning this is kinda sad A few years ago my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and she s developed another type since then She s been going to chemotherapy for a while but about two months ago she picked me up and she was wearing a hat I realized that it was because she had lost her hair and she was afraid what I would think That broke me inside a little That really opened my eyes up to the fact that she isn t doing too well and that someday soon I might lose her It took everything in me to not break down during that visit It screwed me up for the next few days I really didn t know what to do but I couldn t just say nothing and do nothing I couldn t just let her go without any effort on my part to love her while she is still here I ve never lost a loved one and I didn t know how to handle that possibility but I couldn t let her worry if I ll be okay or not after she leaves Finally I decided to give her a letter to let her know how I felt I was really scared because I didn t know if it d be acceptable to do that because how do you talk to a person about the fact that you might lose them soon But I did it and this is the letter I m so glad I gave it to her Hey Nana I love you I wanna start out with I love you because I think it s the most important thing to say I also really want you to know that no matter what happens I ll be okay I know you aren t doing too well and that you haven t been for a while And I just want to let you know that even if you pass away I ll be alright I ll be sad yes It ll hurt yes But I want you to know that I ll be okay I ve been through a lot and I m a strong kid nana I don t want you to pass away but I know that everyone has their time And I really want you to know that when your time comes I ll be alright Even though it ll hurt a lot I ll be okay So please don t worry about me I know I don t come over as often as I should I really want to fix that but with this virus going around and there being so many confirmed cases at where I live I don t know if I can safely I know that normally when I come over I spend most of my time looking at a screen And I m sorry about that I know that when I eat at the dinner table with y all I m usually the quiet kid who listens to everyone else speak And I m sorry that I don t participate more I want you to know that behind every time I ve hidden behind a screen or hidden behind my silence I ve been making an effort to show you how much I love you I m good with words but I never have been good at speaking my mind especially when it comes to family But I want you to know that all of you are so important to me You are all my family I ve had a lot of people try to fill that role and no one has been able to do it except for y all No one has been able to fill the role you fill except for you But please know that no matter what happens I ll still be okay And I m going to try harder to do better and be better I remember that one moment where I grabbed your hands and we had a meaningful conversation I ll never forget that You said you hated seeing me hurt I m doing better now Nana And I m gonna continue to get better I m always going to have that memory and because of that I ll always have a piece of you So please please don t worry about me I love you Nana And I hope you have a wonderful day Sincerely Your grandson I was in tears for days when I wrote this and terrified after I gave it to her I was told the next day that she hadn t read it yet because she didn t want to cry yet I told her when I handed it to her that it would be a sad letter But when I went over after a few days she just walked up to me and rubbed me on the back and went to go sit back down I didn t know for sure at first whether she read it or not but now I m certain And I m so happy that I gave it to her because now she can know that I ll be okay after she leaves I just didn t want her to worry She s still alive btw I hope to go over to her house this weekend I avoided posting the letter for a while because I didn t want this to be a publicity stunt or something I did for attention But some time has passed by and I want people to know that it s okay to reach out to loved ones like this It s okay to talk about stuff like this And personally I think it would be much better to do it while it they re still with you than regret it when they re gone and not be able to do anything then,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

The feeling of isolation It s so hard to put into words the feelings emotions and urges to want to give into giving up I just don t see what the point to life is anymore It s become this rinse lather amp repeat kind of existence and I never thought I would ever feel like this but I do And while I know I have family amp friends who care or supposedly care I can literally go DAYS without a call text or some kind of human interaction and almost of the time I m the person who initiates it Which just reinforces the thoughts in my head where I sit here an think of just how easy it could be it use to be feeling guilty that would make me think exiting stage right would upset people amp it would maybe but now I don t care any more about them because I feel like if any of them gave a shit I wouldn t feel so alone and rejected So the why is complicated I ve been dealing with various health crap my entire life from the mild of dealing with learning disabilities caused by brain damage I was born with to finding out that my dad had a rare genetic disease which caused his cancer and my parents coming clean when I was and ironically right before I was diagnosed with it myself Surgery to prevent cancer to surgery which found cancer to getting poked prodded amp probed between once a year to every few months to more surgery more cancer somewhere in the middle of my mess my dad died my world crashed and my mom decided to start smoking again and waste so much money on opiates to not have to deal with the emotional pain of losing my dad I lost parents that wee early morning hours before the last semester before I graduated w my AA I worked so hard trying to get it before my dad passed my dad and I were close he was my go to for how to deal with shit and now that he s gone it s kinda me going alone we ll it wasn t always but last year my BF tells me the day before that he s moving out what No discussions noth ng just peace out I ll try to help if I can then I figure out how he was able to do it he took advantage of my trust and my memory because he d take money out to pay the rent only I had already paid it now I m dealing with the fact that I have cancer w o a cure and no one cares enough to want to help me or really be there for me so if I ever get to the point where I can t live alone they want to put me in an old person home wtf I d rather end shit on my terms and give those assholes in my life who supposedly love me the finger and let them deal with the fact that I d rather die free than live ina place that wreaks of disgusting bodily fluids and decay no thank you which makes me wonder why I bother doing all this crap to myself when ultimately no one cares if I m here or not I just am so tired of being alone tired of fighting and then confused when people tell me not to give up but then flip around and question why I fight so hard wtf am I suppose to give up amp in and just wait to die If so screw that Not saying I m going to do it now but some days it s really hard to find a reason to keep fighting especially when the ones who supposedly love you could give a rats ass if I m here or not I m just so tired,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I don t belong here I m not sure what I to say or how I to say it I m not sure why I am even writing this because I don t want to hear what people have to say I guess I just want this out there somehow Even if I did want advice no anyone can say anything that will help I highly doubt anyone will even really care Sometimes people think they care but how much of that is because they actually care and how much is because they ve been conditioned to believe they should Have you ever had the feeling of being at a party or event surrounded by people but still feeling alone I feel like that all the time One time in college I decided to get a minor in math I tried to make friends in that department as well as my own department but I always felt like an outsider I felt like I was looking into a fish tank While I liked seeing them and while I felt like I could understand them and their behavior I simply could not exist in their environment I feel like I don t belong on earth My dad had some anger management issues when I was young I never really thought anything of it I just figured that s how things were and it was no big deal Now that I ve been seeing a psychiatrist she explained to me that even though consciously I don t see it as a big deal subconsciously it has left me damaged somehow she didn t actually say damaged As I got older I found out my dad was suspected by a psychiatrist of being bipolar he never went through the full range of tests to prove it I don t blame him because he can t control being or not being bipolar I wonder if I will end up with it as well or if it s true that all his anger has affected me I ve read other stories of people who were abused and therapist type people say that can lead to them being easy targets for others to abuse them later When I was about I was molested by a neighbor who was just a few years older than me I m curious if one of the reasons why I was molested was because of what I said in the previous paragraph I remember a therapist once told me I might have a fear of intimacy I m not sure if that could have been caused by the molestation It only happened once so I m not sure why I can t just get over it I ve tried finding a girlfriend in real life and on dating websites but I get nowhere I ve been able to meet some women but as soon as I get too close to them I start to get nervous and anxious I ve had sex but I never really enjoyed it I think mostly because I wasn t really into them but I kind of just went along with it I m not really sure why I ve also had a lot of what I call pseudo girlfriends women who I m just friends with but we hangout a lot and sometimes even cuddle I know you re probably thinking why not ask one of them to take our friendship to the next level Well I have and that s never worked out for me and I just end up losing friend The more I go on I feel less and less connected to the world I know eventually I am going to end my life one day maybe not soon but one day,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Advice on getting drunk for the first time This may sound a bit vanilla or jokey or whatever but I got properly hammered for the first time ever last night at Overall the experience was enjoyable but I thought I d share some tips from the experience as underage drinking is very common these days Definitely do it in the company of adults and in a safe place Amongst friends in a field is a very very bad idea Make sure the majority of people there have experience being drunk so they know recovery mechanisms or how to deal with you should something go wrong Make sure you have multiple options for sleep so that should you not be able to return home there are other options be it a friend s house or whatever That s the major points out of the way if I think of anything else during my current recovery I ll update this later,"['Seeking Help', 'Mood Tracking']",medium

disgust that they deserve someone better than their shit mommy is mingled up I feel sick because I haven t eaten again too But it doesn t make a difference I m still fat I m not losing weight My attempt was as pathetic and stupid as I am I tried to run outside naked in degree snowy weather and throw myself into water I didn t even make it outside My husband wrestled me to the ground first while I was screaming like a banshee The bruises are a reminder of how pathetic I am I ve been married for six years I ve been in a poly relationship with my boyfriend for four Ex boyfriend Yeah look at the drama queen having a breakdown over her worthless ex My husband is an INTJ He loves me deeply but he s terrible at showing it He s very neurotic read the wikipedia article for Neuroticism and you ve got his biography He s also the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac His upbringing was conservative Christian style abusive and he reacts in a volatile manner to almost everything I m ESFJ I try to keep everyone happy but I guess I m shit at it I rarely clean because I m always tired Keeping him calm when the kids lose it is a strain Keeping myself calm when the kids lose it is a strain Some days I just can t anymore Those are the days we fight He loves me he works very hard for our family I just feel very lonely and not understood Or that he even tries to understand He just wants the fight to stop but also to win it To explain to me with anger skewed logic how I m wrong nomatter what in the heat of a fight When not in a fight he still doesn t know how to do things make me happy even though we ve been married for six years Even though I know how to make him happy I ve tried to tell him sweet things to try he ll do it for a day or two then forget I feel so lonely At some point I d started cutting but rarely Maybe once every few months then a year or two between Four years ago my husband had had a girlfriend on Second Life for awhile and I d been ok with it our marriage had been rocky and it kept him from harassing me for sex so much He had encouraged me to talk to guys there too I met my boyfriend by roleplaying on Second Life and the connection was instantaneous and intense We talked for hours and hours and hours the first few days He understood me the way he thought made sense We had the same interests liked the same games liked the same themes My husband was jealous that we had so much in common but he was getting a lot more sex so he didn t complain much My boyfriend was my social life I told him everything though I told him too much so many times its probably what killed it at some point or another We moved around a lot so I wasn t able to meet up with him until the very end of those four years Well after he was already over me though he always said that he loved me We kept moving then I got pregnant He was sure I d disappear but I didn t No one would hire me pregnant I became a stay at home mother before I even had the baby Childcare would cost the same as me working my ass off at part time jobs just to pay for someone else to raise my children for me My husband hurried and got a job in NYC and we moved to a shitty part of NJ when I was months pregnant The birth was traumatic for me the doctors were horrible to me and bullied me into a cesarean I probably didn t need The new baby was colicky and miserable My husband s job was hell the commute was hell I was alone all day with a miserable baby and my online boyfriend Then the job cut everyone s already spectacularly low pay down by We lost our apartment I had to move in with his control freak hyper conservative christian mother borderline fundamentalist My husband had to move in with a friend for a longer commute for shit pay while the new boss they assigned when the old one quit screamed at his three person department in front of the entire office He had sleep apnea and wasn t sleeping He was in hell His mother is a hoarder I was crammed in a tiny basement filled to the ceiling with bullshit and an extreme mold problem that made everyone sick I had my tiny miserable colicky baby down there while failing at breastfeeding and was in pumping hell He would cry all night and refuse to eat and I had to be chained to a breast pump I was supposed to be illustrating a children s book I hated I eventually finished it but it took months and I still don t like looking at it Talking to Seth was hell I needed help and relief and so did he and we had none to give We would be snappy and miserable at each other So I stopped talking to him My boyfriend was the only thing that got me through it I talked to him a ridiculous amount I was nocturnal to avoid a large portion of everyone s unending stress and talked to him while I tried to work He loved me then dearly He got so much attention and we would spend hours and hours talking and roleplaying and just being together It was unrealistic Then my husband would make the hour long commute to our apartment from work on fridays then the three hour commute to his parents to get there around pm He would be tired and angry and snappy He didn t want to look at the baby We would almost always fight He was miserable and I was miserable and he was jealous He didn t have his girlfriend anymore It was the ugliest time in our relationship It was the ugliest time in my life except for now I think Eventually he quit the hell job and we immediately moved in with my parents because living with his was hell on earth My boyfriend didn t manage well Suddenly that constant attention was pulled I couldn t be on calls much at all I had less childcare and I was severely depressed My husband jealously tried to keep me away from the computer too after I had abandoned him for my boyfriend those six months It was rocky For awhile my boyfriend railed against it fought to have me back like we were before Even if my husband hadn t be jealous that could never happen Not without leaving my husband and through it all I didn t want to I still loved him He couldn t ask me to but I know my boyfriend wished I would Its a natural selfish thing we all do I d been unfair and told him things I shouldn t have told him when I was hurt and when I was angry with my husband It wasn t business to share I d planted strife between them I d always held this naive belief that my boyfriend would love me forever He d pulled away gotten a lot more quiet He didn t respond to everything I said anymore instead I d be writing pages to myself That was around two years in My husband got a job a new job in Pittsburgh We moved for the fifth time in the years I d known my boyfriend We got an apartment I wanted to fly him up but money was tight from all the moving and we were behind on everything Also having a yr old toddler was tough and my relationship was still strained with my husband My boyfriend was around probably out of the same lonliness I was suffering from We were making plans to meet Then I found out I was pregnant again A failed IUD that had been put in incorrectly Who knows if I d been unprotected for a year or if it had moved somehow I ll never know It was dangerous They tried to get me to abort immediately just to be safe but I refused I had to be monitored for a month to make sure I wasn t in danger of ectopic pregnancy Once I was out of danger my boyfriend became cynical and distant He was sneaking around on Second Life with random people e clubs He still played games with me and playing some Warhammer roleplaying games with him and friends revived it a bit I tried to fly him up but became violently ill with morning sickness and he cancelled the flight when I said I couldn t do it I m pretty sure that was the moment it was really over The pregnancy was miserable My husband doesn t do well with small children at all Baby cries make him panic and respond unreasonably and he constantly talked about how awful it would be to have a baby and a toddler together Even though I talked throughout the day every single day my boyfriend was also distant and uncaring He d offhandedly mentioned meeting a girl but her husband had been so jealous it only lasted a couple of days I wasn t carrying a baby it seemed I was carrying a nuclear bomb It was a long lonely miserable pregnancy I cried so much When the baby finally came I had to have another cesarean this time because I d been sitting in a shitty broken chair for years that screwed up the alignment of my pelvis It was my fault You can t have a trip with a new baby You can t have your boyfriend up when your body is shitty and you re breastfeeding While family is constantly in and out While my life was hell At least I d thought so I should ve just let him in I m practical to a fault but I don t think he was even that interested at that point We still talked every day We played games together I tried to make it through my lonely stressful life I held onto him and he was sort of there but I railed against the distance that was so plain Finally we made plans The baby was finally old enough to stay away for a few days We would get together at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh where we live My husband s girlfriend would come up to meet him too a girl he wasn t much into anymore either but wanted to give a chance Just weeks before the trip my boyfriend had a heart attack It was the true end because when he wrote about it on his FA and that girl from before attached herself to him He began talking to her constantly more than me Roleplaying with her doing all the things he did with me when our relationship had been new She was married too She just didn t have children He talked to her for months She began posting pictures of their characters fucking She told me to my e face that it wasn t like that and she respected my relationship meanwhile she wrote all over her tumblr about her new boyfriend I d postponed the trip to October for him to heal It was for two weeks It was pleasant but he was distant and had issues making love to me He spent a lot of time on his phone The second week my husband s girlfriend came up and there was trick or treat and I took the kids to zoo boo and a hallow birthday party for my boyfriend and a friend of mine It was chaotic and my husband had a breakdown because he didn t know how to deal with the jealousy but felt too guilty to leave his girlfriend for long enough to get comfort for me We had a fight where we had to talk it out It was awkward The rest of the trip was ok but the second week was stressful and messy I d made a bad choice in timing and by adding the girlfriend It was too much At Christmas I found out that they were together She posted pictures of her and her husband and him all nude in their furry forms cuddling together I got very upset Then I got dumped I cried I was told at first that I had been chosen The pictures came down We got each other Christmas gifts Then they all reappeared And he chose her I spiraled It was the worst Christmas of my life I spent hours on the phone with him The first few times were sweet and caring Eventually he couldn t keep the facade up anymore He plastered her on his profile immediately I cut myself Five stripes to numb the drowning feeling At some point before then I d figured out that a clean razor stored in a sterile bottle would cut cleanly enough to give me a dose of adrenaline that would numb an episode of drowning It wouldn t make me feel good but it would get my head above water until I just existed in a cold lonely world instead of drowning in a chaotic whirlpool of hurt I took a break from the computer Stopped taking commissions and withdrew to try to get through the holiday I bought a bunch of games on steam and spent a lot of time playing them with my husband He was happy to have me back and since I wasn t outwardly being miserable he assumed I was all better A month of back and fourth with my boyfriend still trying to play games together but his platitudes wearing thin and his promises falling through again and again Then she posts about how he had visited her In November Immediately after seeing me I d been cheated on in the flesh I found out about a week and a half ago I called him I cried a little but I was mostly numb He didn t sound very sorry about it I told him if he wanted me around he would have to talk to me He said he would He barely tried I cut again Four stripes to breathe Then a few days later he leaves to go see her He s at her house right now Fucking her I was stupid I kept looking at his profile on FA As long as things weren t being posted maybe it was going badly Then the flood of blissfully happy images appeared He knew I was following him so even if I hadn t been checking they all flooded my feed I doubt I even crossed his mind when he did it Imagine if someone got a divorce then a month later when his ex found out she d been cheated on he starts plastering his facebook with images of him and his new gf together It was the final blow I ve never felt so ugly so fat so useless in my life or so alone My artwork is constantly surpassed by others and its my own fault for not spending more time on it The time I do spend is away from my children My house is a shitpile because I don t clean When he posted all that I went upstairs upset and sad I was angry and tired I told him what happened and he scolded me for looking at his profile I snapped I told him to say loving words or to shut the fuck up He didn t like it he kept shoving his advice down my throat and I got more and more hysterical I ran downstairs I ve threatened suicide so many times in my hysteria during our echo chamber fights he didn t even follow Then I slammed the silverware drawer and he angrily yelled down at me and ran downstairs I told him to fuck off He tore into me verbally I tore back We worked each other up until I was done I was betrayed and heartfucked by one asshole and would be spending a life with the other who would never ever be able to lick my wounds to actually care Just fucking correct until I gave in I ran for the door I was naked I tried to get it open but he stopped me I ran for the other He stopped me again I ran a third time and got it halfway open he overpowered me and wrestled me to the floor while I screamed and screamed He held me down until I gave up I should ve gone to the hospital but I didn t He stayed home the next day to make sure I wouldn t do anything I asked my ex to call me he said he would then he didn t I m not worth it I m not worth bothering with I m not worth figuring out what I need because why bother on a fat waste of air I m so sad Sorry for the life story It doesn t really tell that my husband is a good person that my boyfriend was too He said so many sweet things but his actions do a lot to prove how false they were That my kids are smart and beautiful but extremely stressful Some days I don t know how to keep going The house is getting steadily more disgusting I m getting snappy at the kids because I want to do nothing but sleep but I don t get the option Its too hard,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress

Just a piece of shitI m and I have had serious relationships in my life My first one started at and went through I was diagnosed with bpd and bipolar disorder at the age of and it caused a lot of problems in my relationships in regards to my being insecure and jealous We ended up getting married but years after we got married I left because my husband was constantly on dating websites which he said he did because I was jealous and nagged at him My second relationship was awful I m pretty sure he has NPD We started as open but he constantly cheated on me then he would claim it was my fault because I was insecure He also got fired months into our relationship for constantly being late to work every day which led to me and his mom financially supporting him I finally got tired of the lying cheating and being used Now I m with a great guy and I can t help but feel like I m fucking up again and I can t deal with it We ve been together since August and I moved in with him last August We had known each other since him and his ex were friends with my ex husband and I so we know each other pretty well When we started dating we discussed having kids he has from his marriage and in November I got pregnant It was my first pregnancy and I was absolutely over the moon We planned it so we found out very early about weeks in Literally the day after we found out I got a call saying my mom was sick I was worried she was going to lay in her bed and die so against my better judgment I told her the news and since I told her might as well tell everyone else Well fast forward to days before my first ultrasound and I start spotting Everyone said it was normal but I was worried The day before I started bleeding heavier and I knew in my heart something was wrong We went in the next day and the screen on the machine was empty and the doctor told us it was a blighted ovum I was devastated That was January th I had a d amp c the next day Ever since then I m so easily irritated and I have no patience I feel like I can t do anything right I used to love to cook but now I worry my boyfriend hates everything I make We talked last night and he basically said he thinks I m not happy and I hate him I told him I feel like he hates me In addition to all of this my dad verbally abused me regularly because he gifted me a car years ago that he bought for his girlfriend who later dumped him I m in no position to buy myself a vehicle so I just have to take it He went off on me yesterday because he didn t like my tone when he made fun of me for making a frozen pizza for dinner Started telling me I m a piece of shit and ungrateful and that I can just pay for my car and he s fucking done with me etc I just feel like a worthless piece of shit,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

The worst most meaningless life is still better than no life at all At least you still have the chance to do the things you love Even if it s only eating your favorite cereal in the morning watching that tv show book you love so much over and over again and waiting for the next sequel falling asleep while listening to the rain drawing at am while drinking your favorite tea etc etc I guess what I m trying to say is life is not to be seen as a whole Life is the little moments you love so much you look forward to everyday YOUR little moments MAKE life If someone would ask you what you love about life those little things would probably not even cross your mind because you see them as meaningless But then again what exactly has meaning in life Everything is meaningless Feeling content while doing the things you like doing is at least for me the ultimate form of happiness and meaningfullness And one can only be happy while alive,['Miscellaneous'],low

My suicidal thoughts I am typically a person who tends to internalize a lot of my problems and do not usually express when I am feeling depressed or sad However I do want to express these problems and talk about them I know I need help with this because I have obsessed over these thoughts for years now I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it s almost no wonder they do But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy so easy compared to most people s it s pathetic I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn t awful I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I m real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I ll die I just feel so lost I am trying to find a path in life where I am not doomed to suffer the majority of the time and live for those small bits of time where I can do what I please I want to live for what I like all the time but I m afraid that s too greedy too much to ask for the majority of people don t how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence Does it even exist Am I chasing after something that can never be attained And if that s the case how do I endure the suffering Because I feel like I am weaker than the majority I am pathetic when compared to the majority People have endured so much more than I have yet they still have the will to move forward when I am here wallowing in despair over the inevitable suffering I will face in the future One day I fear when I finally face my moment of profound suffering it will give me the willpower to end my life If you have anything to say please do I really want to hear your opinion on my circumstances I have kept these thoughts to myself for too long,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

life just seems pointless im senior year i guess i ll start out with how i got to this point i started to feel down th grade around the time my grandpa was in the hospital which i wasn t close to he would come in and out of the hospital and i guess seeing him that way just hurt i dont even know why i felt that way when those words that he said when i was in th grade still lingered i still enjoyed doing simple things and still wanted to try out new things i bought a ukulele got in to drawing and tried making friends i actually met one of my ex best friend she will be coming up at the end it wasn t bad at all but i felt this nagging feeling above my head that i was able to ignore cut to th grade oh boy was that year fun thats when i started questioning why i was still even here breathing i started high school and most of my classes were filled with people from others schools which already had their own friends of groups compared to how i was in middle school i started to become real quiet my middle school wasn t that big and everyone pretty much knew everyone so it was easy for me to conversate with others at the end of th grade i also realized that i was starting to develop anxiety i would shake and my body temperature would go up amp was on the verge of passing out anyways as you can tell trying to talk to others was quite intimidating i started to feel alone and just isolated from everyone in my classes not only that i was in advanced classes and felt so stupid in all of them i couldn t even reach their level of intelligence i was dumb compared to all of them i no longer wanted to participate i would hate when teachers called on me it was the worst feeling ever oh i forgot to mention my grandpa died a month later after my freshman year started i pick up others emotions so i was sad would cry over everything and just felt like complete shit i had about friends at the time which i guess you could say i no longer am friends with them anyways school work started to pile up i started getting stressed about it and would even cry at times because i couldnt understand some of the stuff i started to develop some thoughts that weren t healthy in my head i would tell myself im stupid worthless all the teachers saw me as some excuse o a student and so on i started to just lock myself in my room and sleep i developed an eating disorder which i thought was normal at the time because teenagers right i wouldn t shower for days yet my anxiety kept me worried about how i looked imagine caring about what others think of you while you don t even care about yourself its a fucking pain in the ass i gained a friend that year but eventually cut ties with her during the summer th grade came along i continued to take advanced classes just to make my parents proud i wanted them to be proud of me and tell me that just one time turns out i just disappointed them more this is when i started to skip days at school telling my mom i felt sick and so once i even faked i was sick but it turned out i had strep throat kinda funny tbh ayways my grades started to go down i was usually and A or A B type of girl but my grades started going towards C s and at times D s I met this guy as well that i started to develop feelings for this was the first time i actually wanted to step out of my comfort zone and get to know them i still dont know till this day if it was a good or bad idea i honestly don t remember much about th grade year it seems a little fuzzy all i know is that my depression and anxiety got worse i was thinking about suicide more often and even thought of ways to do it just a reminder my parents and siblings had no idea that i was feeling down i would always act hyper and made jokes just to make them laugh i fake laughed and tried not to get them worried th grade i had only like adv class and an AP class to get myself to take a break i told myself at the end of th grade that i would get my shit together and even managed to get decent grades on the st weeks of school i started to have trouble sleeping my thoughts started to get more vivid and had nightmares i also almost passed out while talking in a group discussion because i was so anxious i dont know how many times i started to write suicide letters i would have breakdown every other month thst led me to just wanting to end it all this took place so last yeart then started everything started to go to shit the guy i mentioned earlier yeah i admitted my feelings towards him and he then started to talk to me less eventually we stopped talking completely mostly it being my fault i also lost my bestfriend i dont know what happened or what i did but we just stopped talking it hurt a lot it really fucking hurt i went days without eating and lost almost pounds i was pounds foot inchs so i finally became underweight that was the only thing i had under control my weight i felt at ease i liked seeing my ribs popping out i liked the way i looked for the first time even now i wish i would stop eating so much this was around the time finally talked to the counselor and my mom and sister came up and talked to them about how i was feeling when we walked out of school my sister just told me you should ve judt killed yourself in there i got a therapist around march i started taking medication went from lexapro prozac some sleeping pills and some other stuff i cant remember lexapro left me feeling numb i couldn t cry i couldn t feel a thing i remember explaining to my friend the feeling its as if you are trapped in the glass box and no matter how many times you try to break it and get out of there it didn t work you just yelled at no one when me and my bestfriend defriended i got a new friend i wasn t at the best state physically and mentally i wouldn t shower for a week i was just bone i would skip a lot of class oh yeah did i mention that i started skipping almost everyday i remember thinking whats wrong with me i wasn t like this how would i let myself get to this point i was someone that cared a out school even if it was challenging i wasn t one to get down over small or big things i wouldn t get hurt over one small comment almost at the end of march i first tried attempting with the lexapro i only took but i called my friends and they picked me up i spent time with them for a little while i stopped myself before i took more so im not sure if its really an attempt i didn t mention this to my therapist because you know i d get sent to the hospital weeks later i attempted again this time i took some pain killers it was at the time they were like mg per pill I just felt a little sick from the stomach but that was all I called my friend again and told her what was going on of them came over and talked to me my friend asked me if i wanted to tell my mom in which i did we ended up crying a lot she kept asking me why do i want to die why am i feeling like this why dont i see value in life do you know how shitty i felt i the person that lives in this body doesn t even know the cause my friends had called out but i started to act hyper i always do this to make others think i am doing well now they ordered pizza and we ate they both worked at the same place so they called the manager and told them that they could actually go in my heart broke a little that day i always wished someone would stay with me even when i told them the opposite they just left they believed i was doing well i ended up telling my therapist what i did a week later since thats when i was scheduled to go she ended up sending me to the hospital and told my mom that its best to do so or i ll end up succeeding although it was nice for me to not worry about anything anymore i didnt like it i wasn t with the people that i cared about all i needed was to be with the ones that cared and loved me even if they were acting as if they did thats all i needed i pushed them away so many times and i know its my fault i know i am the one to blame but i still felt even more depressed because i wanted them to tell me no i am not leaving i wanted them to just lay with me and hug me and just tell me everything was going to be okay even if i didnt believe that thats all i ever wanted june came along so school ended i tried again i tried overdosing on sleeping pills i took about this time even till this day i still have no clue what i meant to text one of my friends ah i forgot to mention the friend i gained after i lost my best friend dated my brother i started to like her a little after they broke up and she even admitted that she was kind of gaining interest on me while dating my brother i was so confused during this time though because she never told me straight forward if she liked me or not i wasn t in the best state of mind obviously so all that made sense to me was that she hated me she never liked me and just used me to gain information about my brother i had also stopped talking to my other friends and even stopped telling one of them the same one that works with her about what i was thinking because the first thing she would do is tell her anyways im pretty sure it caught her by surprise that i texted her that day and it not making any sense all i remember was going unconscious and then waking up several times i would try to plug in my phone to charge and i thought i would and would pass out and then wake up to do the same thing standing up was hard i almost fell because of how heavy my body felt thankfully i didn t throw up i hate throwing up cue to the next day i had my therapy appointment im surprised my therapist didn t ask if i was okay i was shaking a lot and couldn t focus i was still out of it and had the same feeling i had the day before but without feeling my body heavy passing out randomly and so i even drove that day which i know i shouldn t have but i wasn t thinking I can t even remember much of that day I do remember around pm though I started to text my friends I cant remember what i said or what they said i do remember getting angry and i started to get aggresive the last thing i told the friend that i liked at the time no wonder that my brother left you before that i do remember her saying that you can t help someone that doesn t want help thats all i can remember that just hit me for some reason all those months that i tried getting help seemed like nothing to her i was so fucking upset this was the same person that dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression someone that even attempted thats why it hurt so much i was trying so hard to get help even if it was hard for me to open up i was never taught to talk about my feelings so the fact that i told an adult meant that i seriously was in need of help i ended up blocking everyone and i cried so much i cried a lot it hurt it still hurts she even told me she thought of telling me that i should ve killed myself now i wish that she did say those words then i would have an actual reason i texted them the next day and told them i was sorry they forgave me which they shouldn t have maybe it was better and if we just left it like it was i still hate myself for saying those words till this day i haven t been the same ever since nothing feels real cut to th grade which is now i was planning on doing it on my birthday i wrote a note each day leading to it and i decided to do it days earlier i was supposed to start my first day at my job i called out and told my mom i was working i went to the park i was planning on slitting my wrist turned out the blade amp pocket knife didn t work so well on my wrist and barely did anything i didn t tell my friends about it and decided to just wait till my actual birthday thinking it was just the day you know my birthday came up and i was waiting for my friends to say happy birthday they didn t i posted on my story crying i wrote on the last note they forgot about my birthday the day i hated the most my birthday made me hate it even more i wasn t worthy of their time they saw my stort and felt bad and texted me they came to my house and gave me last minute gifts they felt forced i doubt they even wanted to be there cue to now i finally pushed them off for good i told them what i was planning and told them how i was feeling they ended up writing a letter to my mom like days ago and left it in the mail i was the one that went to get the mail that day i read it and i got really upset angry sad the people that i thought knew me the most wanted to send me to the hospital all i wanted was for them to stay with me not send me somewhere in which i feel trapped somewhere where they are not i got angry and texted them were involved in this one wasnt i texted on the gc where all were one the one that wasnt a part of it got upset over what i said the others didnt say anything until i said if that was all they got i started saying to tell me how they really feel about me because i knoe they are holding themselves back just because they are afraid i ll break i blocked all of them after that and now i have no reason for no longer to stay here even one of the people which were feeling suicidal a while back wated to send me to the hospital when i didn t even think about sending them there because i know it wasn t what they needed or wanted they needed to be with people that loved them and made sure they were safe i didnt get out of her car that day and told her i wasn t leaving she gave in and slept in my room why couldn t they do the same for me am i not worthy of having someone do that for me its kind of funny i was in my car the other day in the same spot we were in when we skipped school one day at that time i thought i was really alone but now now i ve actuall reached that i am alone now i have no one in the end i am the one that never deserved to be here i didn t deserve them i didn t deserve to live i should ve died a long time ago i dont know how long i ll be here there is no point in living anymore im just a walking robot at this point i no longer have anyone or anything to live for,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood

I just got yelled at for bringing an empty cup into my livening room Ok so it all started earlier today near the afternoon and I noticed we had some apple cider in our fridge so I grabbed a mug and poured it and then put it in the microwave to heat it up I used to do this a lot when I was younger and I still love even as I am older so I heat it up then I drink it in the kitchen when I am sloshed to drink and eat things However when I was done with the drink my sister called me over to help her and her friend so I set my drink and the counter in the livening room and go to help her out So my day goes on and around ten minutes ago I heart mom yell my name and it s her and her boyfriend just sitting there and she ask me about the cup I then explain to her how it got there and her boyfriend then yells at me saying I am lying like a little kid and that this isint the first time he caught me Ok the first time was around two months ago when I ate a popsicle while standing on the floor in the livening room So now he s pissed and my mom took his side and now they want to turn off my phone so wish me luck boys,"['Mental Distress', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium
My chronic depression is getting worse This world feels like a nightmare NSFL I m thinking about suicide a lot I want to be dead I once thought that human problems were surmountable but they re not They re just not I only want to live if I can think of a scheme in which humans aren t doomed and I can t I ve tried and I can t and that depresses me Everyone I ve ever loved is going to die I m going to die Everyone works hard for things which they forget about when they die Everyone feels pain There s so much agony in the world So much madness Small animals by the millions are being poured into grinders alive their meat comes flowing out a tube like shit from an anus Young children are beheading people but tiny baby arms are so weak they saw the heads off slowly And then other children listen to music that s merely people screaming Screaming This is a world of endless screaming High school graduations happen and the young men and women without scholarships walk away knowing that they will live lives of struggle which will be harvested as tax dollars for the state no differently than the way human batteries are harvested by the machines of The Matrix The planet is suffering and the minds able to come up with schemes capable of reversing the damage being done are killing themselves The leaders we elect have values not plans or schemes Human history is filled with torture slavery and suffering I hate being human Most of my friends are depressed because I find happiness intolerable pathological happiness in the face of this worlds past present and future seems like a crime to me Every religion secretly prescribes nihilism Humans exploit one another in life because nature has been overridden by the state thanks to human nature And I feel worlds away from it all I don t want to participate in human affairs but go in direction completely opposite to wherever this leads I don t have any hope for humans I just hope That this is all some kind of simulation intended to teach me how not to behave What if evolution made us miserable so we could survive I don t feel like anyone can relate to me I don t feel human I don t understand what I m supposed to do for you I don t understand why as I ve aged I ve become more sensitive and not less The adults who raised me were so stupid that I assumed I would become numb when I grew old but it seems like the complete opposite has happened These feelings Was I programmed to function in a smaller world I drive down the street and it scares me that I have this urge to meet everybody I see but I roll past them like they re nothing And I m nothing too What s the point in being a nothing that feels something And there s no such thing as help People don t help they help themselves by getting jobs One of my only older friends she s really jaded about life she feels like it let her down She told me that I should try not to obsess over these things our world and universe is eating itself that people who do do end up killing themselves I just can t though It s getting harder and harder to wake up in the morning and when I do wake up I ll go back to bed to cover up my disgusting self I will delete this post to cover up my disgusting self but I promise I won t kill myself I feel so torn because I want to like existence but I don t And it s the only existence I know And that hurts even more If only I could go somewhere else,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I need helpBefore you get to thinking I m just some crazy person over the internet im still in highschool I ve tried finding all the outlets I could from playing sports learning guitar focusing on academics and even getting extra care from therapists counselors along with antidepressants but I feel like I can t do it anymore All the memories are too much and people are too bad for me to see the good in the world I have vivid memories of being that little kid around the ages of who was getting verbally abused by his parents and being outcasted by everyone around his age for being different I never really had friends I just remember always being by myself and it got so bad that sometimes I would just run outside and find some corner or crevice to hide in because I was so scared of the world and the kids were so fucking mean to me Public school wasn t any better I only had one friend the entire time who later would just fade off like the others and everyone would just use me for personal gain while I would get nothing in return From bullying me for my lunch lunch money to pushing me in the restrooms to having me do their work for them I was just a little bitch and those memories are so traumatic and hurt to think about to this day plus my life at home was full of seclusion trying to find a way out of all the fighting amongst the members of my family that at times did involve the choking and hitting of my siblings and even sometime me simply for just being annoying or talking when I shouldn t of I found my escape in technology and sports and really didn t develop any relationships with any of my family My brothers and sisters never even talk to me and my parents just ignore me once I get home now a days I used to wait everyday when I was just for one of my parents to come in and have a meaningful conversation with me but they would never talk to me They would just make fun of the videos I would watch on YouTube and the games I would play with my dad calling me a faggot and a loser throughout most of that stage of my life He would tell me that sometimes he wishes that I was never born so that maybe our family could ve been better Around I would pace around the halls late at night with tears in my eyes trying to build up the courage to go to the kitchen get one of the knifes and slit my wrists but I was too much of a pussy I don t know whether I regret not doing it to this day I still have to live with the painful memories and I feel like no one can understand the life that I lead and all the pain I carry with me Now that I m in highschool I ve built I large number of friends I play varsity sports I m excelling academically but I feel like my mental health is slipping My family is coming together but the memories are almost everyday the simplest thing triggers everything to come back like a wave I just feel so alone and I really just want any help I can get a lot of stuff I don t tell my closest friends about because I m afraid of them getting sick of me If anyone could reach out and just let me know I m not alone that would be greatly appreciated,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
Goodbye Deb I quit my job last September because it was killing me That was my first mistake For a while I was fine Made some great friends online and started looking for a new job One by one each of those friends moved on lost a bunch to a big argument about another of my friends and things went downhill from there In the end I landed myself with a single friend A really really good friend but just one none the less Last month her husband was diagnosed with cancer and I spent every waking moment trying to help her get through to his surgery that was last week The surgery went fine and he is recovering well they have yet to confirm that it was indeed cancer but they removed the thyroid successfully regardless but the problem is That time I spent taking care of her took its toll on me She is still super emotional with everything that has been going on in her life and I broke last week and started feeling suicidal The problem is I told her And she cried about it A lot To the point where her husband has forbidden her to talk to me anymore I wasn t in any place to handle that news and I am ashamed to say I didn t handle it well especially considering the last time this happened see my previous posts but now I am left with no job no money no friends And I just miss her so much already I don t know how I can go on,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Hmmm just thinking Today me and my friend started talking about girls when i just suddenly remembered something i had with someone who meant and means a lot too me they don t know it obviously So i was camping with a friend his sister and her friend and parents obviously we were sitting around the camp fire and we run out of camp chairs and i offered my chair too my friends sisters friend she declined and sat on my lap instead as the night went on we got closer just talking about bs and at dinner we shared a plate After that i sat her down on the chair and washed up came back and she stood up and said sit down she got back on my lap but this time closer she had her legs on the chair down one side of me and her head on my shoulder and snuggled into my shoulder neck Then we were offered a can of soft drink coughs in beer i said no but she said yes and we shared it which i wasn t expecting by now it was like and everyone had gone too bed but we were still in the chair around the fire we just talked then she fell asleep and i couldn t move cos it was one of the nice stuff feelings ever i eventually fell asleep and sometime during the night it got really cold and we ended up with a blanket over us idk who put it over us we woke up i took her too go get coffee cos they had a mobile coffee shop and we held hands on the way then the next day we had too say our goodbyes and it was like nothing happened between us which at the time i thought nothing of but now like damn now at school its just a nod too each other and occasionally saying hi it was one of the nicest experiences of my life and its sad that theres nothing between us cos i still like her a lot well im going camping in the holidays with the same people most likely so i hope something comes of it if you read this thanks just hit me today and it hit hard and i really miss her thanks again people,"['Positive Coping', 'Mood Tracking']",low

Alternatives to seeking help Hey so over the summer there have been longer times sometimes over several weeks where I ve felt what must be almost completely normal I had an almost positive or at least hopefull view of my future things interested me again and I got like a spark in my soul to do things I could talk to people and handle conflicts without any issues or anxiety and even heavily boosted my confidence from any social contacts What struck me the most was that I went to sleep at peace every night confident even an looking forward to the next day Anyway well that s all gone now and my depressed shitty thoughts torment me all night and the thought of suicide lingers in the back of my head all day which I mostly spend doing absolutely nothing and having anxiety now from all social contact even social mistakes I might have made during the time I felt better I know now that I can t escape this on my own I just accidentally stumbled into having a few good weeks by some lucky coincidences in my life and since that s all gone now I know I need outside help amp nbsp amp nbsp If you want to stop reading right here the problem in a nutshell is that I have from experience lost all faith and respect for professional psychiatry psycology Does anyone now of any kind of alternatives that doesn t require me to spill my soul out to any person or therapist who would most likely be incompetent won t have the time just wants to get my money while doing as little as possible amp nbsp amp nbsp The long story is I tried getting help a long time ago when my depression forced me to quit med school before even the first tests of the first term I went to the state health provider in my country and just got worse from it They made me see different doctors at each appointment every one of which needed to hear my story from the start which I really hated to tell people I had just met My meds where changed almost every second week for no reason since the antidepressants I mostly got need around a month to even show effect After around a month and a half of this I tried to kill myself with prescribed anti anxiety meds and alcohol woke up in the hospital where a new psychiatrist made me promise to her personally that I would not kill myself until I came to see her again two days later I did but she was apparently busy walked past me in the waiting hall without acknowledging me so I got to meet a fourth year med student this time doing her clinical experience time or something She drilled me about if med school was too hard for me I told her no since we hadn t even reached the first exams yet but she ended up writing that as the probable cause on my medical papers anyway For me this was like a fellow med student writing I was literally shit on official papers any kind of confidence I had completely destroyed and I just felt abandoned by the whole thing So a few weeks later when a different doctor forgot to set up a new appointment before which another doctor had refilled my prescription for the same anti anxiety meds while saying no joke you must have run out of them by now I just allowed myself to slip through their cracks and disappear amp nbsp Around six months later I tried to get help again from a private psychiatrist which felt like it was going well I got the meet the same person every week and got to know him and felt confidence in him and everything I told him how I was feeling every week and while he couldn t pinpoint a cause or a solution I thought he was working towards something Until one day shit hit the fan completely and I got really really suicidal I went to the next appointment with my parents and he told me he couldn t help me anymore I was too serious For the several months I had been going to him and assuming he knew what he was doing and working towards something with the questions he was asking he actaully had no idea but didn t think to mention it until I got really suicidal again and was a danger to becoming a bad statistic in his records I got the blame both from him and my parents since if I really had been honest with him he would have known I would be getting seriously suicidal again before it happened My parents actually chalked up the failure of the state health provider to mostly be because of me not being honest and cooperative enough with them too after this amp nbsp amp nbsp So if any of you read all the way here you know why I don t want to get back into any of this shit again it only made me worse But now I m feeling suicidal and shitty again and I know I can t fix it by myself so what other options do I have,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Paranoia controlled lifeFor the past three years I have been suffering from an extremely strange twist on my reality I still have not been able to explain well to others what exactly is going on in my head because even I don t fully understand I will start from the beginning with my best attempt to summarize the problem When I was I was self medicating with weed and alcohol on a daily basis There s no doubt in my mind that smoking pot plagued me with a lasting paranoia beyond the initial high or trip Say what you want about weed but the fact about it is that it can be very dangerous for some people It shattered my self esteem and I still feel like I am in constant danger At this same point in my life I was very isolated and depressed The most regretful part about this time is that I was self loathing and didn t realize how much opportunity around me there was to make positive changes In other words I was being a bitch about the life I had I am a lot better about this now and have no problem displaying positivity in front of others when I have the chance to do it I freeze up with nervousness in some social situations but I kicked the tendency to try to look sad for sympathy The subject of looking upset in front of others was not a completely new thing either Even as a little kid and teenager people would say to me things like what s wrong you look sad or you look like you are in physical pain what is going on or you need to smile more Also I have always had red watery eyes This led people to believe that I was stoned all the time even though I had never even seen weed until I started college I say this to explain that others have seen sadness or seriousness on my face when I am not trying to send off that energy and to transition into the beginning of the traumatic part At the job I had when I was self loathing I was purposefully looking down enough to the point where my coworkers thought I was actually crying I wasn t actually spilling tears because I had to work and didn t want to but I was figuratively crying about my life at work in front of others It took me awhile to figure out that people came to this conclusion but when I did I quit If I could choose a saying to apply to this it is definitely you got what you wished for I wanted people to see that I was sad and I got that in a way that was humiliating I was happy to be at work I really liked that job I had perfect attendance and took pride in my position with nerdiness Realizing that people thought I was crying over having to work made me panic to the point of having to hold back tears I let the opinion of others take control of me The next job I started was bussing tables I went into this job care free ready to forget my previous experience of regret and embarrassment I had already started to make an effort to act uplifted when I started working here Even when I felt comfortable and believed that I had picked a good gig because the restaurant speed and environment was enjoyable people thought I was crying over the work I swear I would feel totally calm and ask a customer if I could take a plate and they would be holding back laughter refusing to make eye contact with me When I realized this I became so self conscious about the way my face looked that almost every time a customer would ask me something I would feel like I was about to cry My face would twitch and my lip would quiver I never had tears streaming down my face at work but I would be on the verge of tears from the paranoia and panic This was an even more humiliating work experience for me because the public was there to witness and the town began to talk My reputation was completely stained with pathetic stories This same thing repeated with three jobs after this one After over three years since the problem first appeared there have been brighter times from then until now where the problem has not been fully surfaced in my every day life like it is now But it always creeps back in and pulls me down I still can not figure out if I looked so anxious and depressed that the appearance of my watery eyes led people to believe that I was crying What I do know is that I allowed it to push me over and become a reality Now it completely controls my life If I just talk to someone face to face it makes me want to cry Imagine just having someone ask you directions to a train station and becoming so overwhelmed with self consciousness that you begin to shake and tremble with a face about to weep When I walk down the street I feel like everyone will look at me and think I am crying So I always feel like I am about to do so It s not to the point of tears streaming down my face in public but it s everything that starts before that when anyone cries It s a cringed face quivering lower lip trembling etc I now live in NYC and just walking down the street is a horror Everyone on my street recognizes me as the young guy who you can see trying not to cry The delusional thoughts I have create the reality I can t think of anything more embarrassing for a twenty two year old male to be going through I am only still living because of the fear of hurting family and friends I would leave behind I think about jumping in front of the train a lot I go to a therapist once a week have tried multiple anxiety and depression medications currently tapering off Lamictal which makes everything a hell of a lot worse and the only thing that really helps are benzodiazepines Smoking weed definitely exaggerated panic in me and I believe this is why I am easily overcome with fear when people look at me A lot of the thoughts that would float through my brain during stoned contemplation would be self critical so I believe that those thoughts created an immense negative view of myself that I wrongly presumed people saw too It has been over two years since I bought weed but I have accepted hits every now and then Now I will completely refuse it because of the state of my brain To make matters worse I have used cocaine a little bit It was never an addiction but just an unhealthy choice I made several times which obviously did not help with paranoia Before I started getting high I was a bright kid and handled conflict well with my first job I knew how to handle customers yelling at me I would appreciate any stories of overcoming serious paranoia or advice on treatments that I may not know about I am trying to find some kind of practical coping method Thanks for reading a post this long edit I am new to reddit so any subs you think I should transfer this to would be

First times thinking about suicide recentlyBeen on antidepressants for half a year now things have only gotten worse since taking them Recently started thinking about what the repercussions of suicide would be and what would happen after i die How would I do it What s the quickest most efficient way that s least painful I don t even wanna act like I ve got some huge sob story and my life has been doomed from the start I m just sick of hating myself and wanting to be somebody else I m tired of waking up and wanting to go back to sleep even though I m not tired I wanna just sit in a metal box and stare at a wall for a long while I wanna just stop existing for a little while I m so burnt out Not even from school I m burnt out from life The nice thing about it all though is that I kinda like the power of not caring anymore I m about to graduate high school and go to my dream college and all I can help but think about is how much I don t care about my future anymore I don t care about the consequences of my life anymore It s nice to not care about all the little things that used to make me hate myself Now when I screw things up instead of feeling like crap and just think about how it won t matter in the long run since there won t be a long run A part of me hopes things get worse so I can just off myself and not have to care anymore so my fuck ups stop having power over my mentally ill brain,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Life is pain m My life story is long upsetting and frankly a little unbelievable at points so I ll spare all those details despite the fact that they give context to my suffering The point is is that recently I ve moved states because I wanted to leave a very stressful job I had elsewhere I now live with my father who is mostly insensitive and mechanical in regards to my existence The extent of his relationship with me seems to be him asking why I don t make much money and constantly telling me to get another job and suggesting random jobs for me to do He also says I should just get up and go even though I have no emotional motivation Unfortunately I now have a tedious and mundane job working at a call center and it feels as if my mind has been put through an incredibly dull blender The majority of my co workers are in their sixties or more and what few people I can relate to don t care enough about me to remember I exist outside of the office so I don t have a strong friend group or support system What s more is that I was recently diagnosed with genital HSV I ve had two sex partners my entire life and I know I got it from my first one because we had unprotected sex once and the infection is localized to a point that is usually covered by a condom She decided to ignore me a long time ago so I can t tell her about it Anyway with a lack of money a car friends and now the end of my hope for a sex life I no longer want to live I ve felt that way for some time now but the feeling is especially strong now I have been diagnosed with clinical depression in the past No offense but I don t need to be told that things will get better and that I just need to hold on Are there any suggestions as to what I can do I m not stoic enough to put myself through rigorous daily exercise The pain of it outweighs any other feeling I get I do take a lot of long walks,"['Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

I feel like I ve lost my mindMan life sucks This will be a long summary of what led me to my caption above I F am so tired of living Every single day that I wake up feels like a struggle so I just stopped waking up I sleep all day I sleep until it s the middle of the night and then I wake up because I can t sleep anymore I hate my life In summary I was born as a refugee and brought here as a severely malnourished child with many health related issues that I overcame Due to the fact of assimilating to America as a small baby with a mom who barely could speak English and older siblings with severe PTSD we had an extremely rough upbringing We were starving and hungry most of our days We landed in New York and were brought to Boston The income disparity between me and my peers were staggering My older siblings got jobs to support us and my mom fell into a deep depression that debilitated her and in turn made her completely bed ridden I wouldn t consider my mom abusive but after going to therapy I found that I was severely neglected as a child My mom had really bad PTSD and horrific depression Most days she stayed in bed as I watched her body deteriorate She was prone to many illnesses due to her major depressive state My mom had also been brutally sexually assaulted and raped trying to emigrate all of us Due to this fact she always assumed that I couldn t be around anyone of the opposite sex including my own brothers uncles cousins and most especially others My mom would do daily checkups and check my genitalia anytime I would leave the house and come back home just to see if my hymen was intact still I was such an anxious kid because of this I would always jump when she would come around Yet on the flip side I was attached to my mom at the hip in a very unhealthy way My dad came to America for two short years and could ve done so much for us He was an engineer Yet he was a scumbag and decided to leave my mom because of his toxic habits and laziness He went back to the homeland so he could have maids and cooks and marry a young year old woman who would bear more kids for him Anyway I was the youngest out of I was advanced in school I did EVERYTHING I needed to do to escape poverty and to escape the environment I was being raised in I told myself that this life wouldn t last long I told myself that one day I would be able to take care of all of us included the rest of my extended family who couldn t escape the war torn country we emigrated from My mom moved us to a different state when I was about years old so we could be closer to people who were from our ethnicity since Boston had very little refugees from my country This was the biggest mistake We went from a city that had ample opportunities to a place with little to none We were subjected to even worse poverty and hunger and terrible living conditions Boston was more of an advanced city they had programs for people like us and educational opportunities that kept my mind working and my stomach full I spent most of my days daydreaming I would write a lot and read anything I could get my hands on shampoo bottles textbooks anything to keep me from my mind Most of my younger years were spent in my bedroom I wasn t allowed to hang out with friends go to the movies you can say I was extremely sheltered I wasn t allowed to leave the home unless it was for school or a doctor Me and the rest of my siblings always assumed it was because my mom was protecting us but as an adult I found out that it was because she had agoraphobia and severe anxiety She wanted us around because she would have panic attacks if she was ever left alone Up until this day shes never spent one day by herself At the age of I skipped my th grade year and tested out straight to high school I was in my freshman year of high school albeit being socially stunted compared to my classmates I was cognitively equal I spent three years in high school and skipped my th grade year I was when I graduated high school I got accepted to a plethora of colleges including Harvard It was my dream come true I was finally going to be back in the same city I used to live in Cambridge Ma My mom wouldn t allow it She said no to everything because I was too young She instead had me enrolled into a local community college My dreams were shattered Everything I had ever worked for was gone At I received my associates and finished my degree at the community college It was at this point when my mom had to leave the country to visit family This was the first time in my life I spent a single day without her During the time she was away I decided to be a teenager for the first time in my life I hung out with my friends attended parties and smoked my first joint By this point most of my older siblings moved out and began lives of their own There were only two of us left in the home me y o and my sister who was y o It was one of my older sisters who took the task to watch over us while my mom was away I met the love of my life while my mom was gone He was much older than me but we aligned in every single way He was I was I ve spent everyday with him minus a few up until now I felt like life was finally going to be great A year later I got accepted to the local university to finish my bachelors and found out I was expecting a child I had several good years and went on to finish my bachelors and land a job at the worlds leading tech companies The depression finally went away This is when we were given the horrible news We found out that my husband was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease and was in end stage kidney failure He required dialysis x a week to survive He lost his ability to walk My heart was broken The depression returned My life turned upside down again years of panic and anxiety and finally he received a kidney transplant It s been months since he received a new kidney and he has a few more surgeries left to help him walk again but I can t feel anything anymore I m numb I should be happy but I feel nothing at all I turned to alcohol because everything became too much I became an alcoholic I drink every day I drink my days away I think about how there s darkness looming around every corner I don t take my medication because I ve been down that road and I feel like it won t stop life from causing me to suffer I ve done therapy group therapy inpatient and outpatient treatments I feel like this shit is never going to end I just want to make it end Life is miserable and I really feel like I lost my mind TLDR I had a shitty upbringing and as soon as I thought I escaped my adulthood was even worse I ve lost hope,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress

Lookin for Some AdviceHey so I ve been pretty down for as long as I can remember Always seem to feel out of place unless I m sitting around by myself I have several groups of friends which don t interact with eachother in any way but still I always feel like a loner There are the typical depressed feelings like being a burden or that somehow in someway things are just better without me but my family was usually there to disperse those At the end of last semester I was dismissed from college and had to move home School is fairly easy for me but I have grown so apathetic that I simply stopped going to class For whatever reason upon moving home I decided it was a good idea to tell my family that I smoke weed I tried to explain that it helps me to just get out of my head and let go of my anxieties but they all still treat me like I m some big drug addict burn out They may be right although I really dont feel so Also my girlfriend broke up with me but still works at my families restaurant I really didnt want the relationship to end and she seems like she doesnt either I feel like she is scared of me I have been good at being alone for most of my years but now I cant seem to stop thinking about it I cant shake this terrible anxiety that I feel is constantly circling me I have been to doctors and psychiatrists and am on several different medications to attempt to remedy this but nothing seems to work I feel like dying would be a great solution for everyone but I dont really feel like killing myself It seems like it is too easy of a way out for me and I would just be leaving behind all of my messes for someone else At the same time I would love to die I dont know I suppose this was a bit of an unorganized rant more than anything but if anyone has any advice or anything really it would be greatly appreciated,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Why are people so quick to jump on the pro life wagon every time someone mentions suicide First response anytime suicide is mentioned is call a crisis line or get help or etc What really is so bad about taking one s life aside from potentially hurting family friends if you even have any Personally suicidal thoughts are the only thing that get me through the week I think to myself that I ll do it Saturday night and I just bide my time till then It makes me feel relieved inside to think about not having to deal with anything anymore Only thing stopping is me is being scared of actually doing it But as each weekend goes by I get closer to overcoming the fear So why can t other people especially strangers give their blessing when someone expresses their wish to die rather than try and talk them out of it right away,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Mood Tracking']",high

destroying myself on purpose but too afraid to die I ve been reading y all s stories for a few days now and it s convinced me to finally make a reddit account so I can tell my very pathetic story When I was around I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on medication for it This medication Vyvanse is really good at killing your appetite I have a bit of an eating disorder so I quickly became obsessed with the meds I still only eat one meal a day at best and I love it The downside to Vyvanse is that when it wears off it makes me EXTREMELY depressed and suicidal After a while though I developed this weird masochistic appreciation for it Like my eating disorder made me decide it was best to purposely find something to make me suicidal I lost so much weight with the meds that the only thing to do now is get rid of my body completely My eating disorder isn t about losing weight to look pretty in fact I think I m adorable My eating disorder is about wanting to get rid of my body I don t want to have a body I guess Am I making any sense I knew I d be ok without the meds I knew I could get help and live my life happily But I didn t want to have hope I wanted to suffer and die You can often see me cringing People point it out sometimes I literally cannot help but cringe at the thought that I m a human being that exists I hurt myself a lot too I used to cut but I ve gotten bored of that I like banging my head against stuff mostly Stupid I know I feel like if I hit myself over the head hard enough my soul or whatever will come loose and I won t have to live in this flesh prison anymore I remember once I slammed my head in a very heavy drawer and everything went black God it was blissful I ve tried recovering multiple times I ve tried throwing the meds out and looking for help But the problem is I EAT when I m not on them I EAT a TON and I can t have that I can t I can t I can t I can t I ve tried reaching out to people but I can t connect with anyone I m disgusted by the idea of telling my family and I only have two friends but I don t feel comfortable around them There s no one I just can t form meaningful relationships with anyone and I can t talk to anyone So recovery is out of the question I have to kill myself I ve spent all this time purposely making myself suicidal and it s gotten to the point where the thought of the sun rising tomorrow morning brings me to hysterical tears I ve only tried killing myself once I found the key to my father s gun cabinet and took out his pistol I sat on the floor asked the Lord for forgiveness and then put the gun to the roof of my mouth I got a horrendous image of the way my head would fold open when the gun went off I dropped the gun and cried harder than I had ever cried in my life I ve never been that scared before The only thing more pathetic than purposely making yourself depressed and suicidal is purposely making yourself depressed and suicidal and not being able to pull the trigger I m now I m and weigh lbs which is a lot for me I m still on my meds and still depressed just like I wanted to be but I know I won t kill myself I m sorry if this is a spit in the face to anyone I know it s horrible and pathetic and disgusting to ruin yourself this much on purpose I m still hurting myself in the hope that I ll toughen up and finally end it I m sorry that this is so long and confusing I ve never really had anyone to talk to It s a weird situation too I guess it needed a lot of explaining,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

The worst most meaningless life is still better than no life at all At least you still have the chance to do the things you love Even if it s only eating your favorite cereal in the morning watching that tv show book you love so much over and over again and waiting for the next sequel falling asleep while listening to the rain drawing at am while drinking your favorite tea etc etc I guess what I m trying to say is life is not to be seen as a whole Life is the little moments you love so much you look forward to everyday YOUR little moments MAKE life If someone would ask you what you love about life those little things would probably not even cross your mind because you see them as meaningless But then again what exactly has meaning in life Everything is meaningless Feeling content while doing the things you like doing is at least for me the ultimate form of happiness and meaningfullness And one can only be happy while alive,['Miscellaneous'],low

Not really suicidal just depressed For a while a couple of years I have been getting more and more depressed However I m very good at hiding it so the only people who know are my close friends who cared enough to listen to my stoned rants about how shitty my life is Actually that s not true My life is great compared to a lot of people my family rocks I have a decent amount of money I m in college and good friends But there is one thing that has been missing from my life a relationship I m basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl I m now and it s awkward to admit I have a girl I kind of like who I work with but she s from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopes I really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am but I don t want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist They have enough worries without worrying about me I know they would give me all the help in the world but I just can t bring myself to telling them about it Every time my Mom randomly asks Are you O K I think for a second to say no and tell her everything But instead I smile say Of course Mom and move on with my life Anyways I just wanted to vent here because I know the people here will listen It actually really helps to type out my feelings like this,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
Could this be considered an attempt I ll begin with that I am not currently depressed anxious nor receiving any kind of treatment However I often find myself reflecting on an event that took place about eight years ago At the time I was diagnosed having an anxiety disorder and likely depression Though I m not a physician I was reluctant to accept the doctors diagnoses of depression but having had a prior bout with anxiety I began treatment for both In time and under medical supervision I was eventually permitted to cease treatment Some time later I went though a period of limited and difficult sleep Sleep has been an issue for me since early adolescence One night after about hours of sleeplessness I had become so desperate and exhausted that all I wanted all I could think about was sleeping I took a handful of pills muscle relaxers a couple of different narcotic pain killers and diphenhydramine Probably around pills total washed down with about half bottle of liquor The drowsy feeling I had been seeking was upon me in short order Before surrendering to sleep a though crossed my mind It may have been too many pills to much liquor I had my phone by my bed and two flatmates within earshot I didn t care I just wanted to sleep and soon I would be I awoke about a day later with evidence that I had pissed myself sometime during my drug enabled sleep I did not actively seek to end my life however for that brief moment before surrendering to sleep I was honestly indifferent about ever waking up I ve not since found myself in such circumstances and have been mostly happy for the greater part of the past decade but I often think about that night and wonder how to classify it I ve never spoken to anyone about it and this is the first time it has even been externalized put to paper computer screen TLDR Couldn t sleep Took a lot of pills and booze Before passing out honestly thought it may have been too much but I didn t care Help was readily available just needed to shout for one of my mates thin walls or could have used the phone sitting right next to me Wasn t trying to kill myself but I didn t care if I never woke up,"['Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking']",medium

"Hello fellow friends 😄
 
 I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.
 
 There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?
 
 For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 
 
 I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:
 
 ""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""
 
 To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""
 
 So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: ""There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?""","['Cause of Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping']",medium

"Hi there, I am a 23 y/o girl with a single mother who is presumed to have bpd or c-ptsd (suspected by my counsellor). I love her a lot but I just find it endlessly difficult to get along with her as she is very intense. We argue a lot, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I do hate that one silly argument can result in a week long silent treatment/ resentment in my mother. This period kills me as I love to sort things out soon (no later than a day), say our apologies and move on. After every argument she’ll say something along the lines of “it’s not like we have a good relationship” “I will get back to you to set up new boundaries for our new relationship..” or she’ll threaten to never talk to me again and accuses me of causing her lots of pain. This is why I moved out.
 
 Ive notices that she copies a lot of the things I do and that she is finding herself at the same time I am. There’s nothing wrong with that but it makes me feel icky. She copies the shoes I wear, wants to travel when I do, wants to suddenly move to another area when I’m moving out of home (when she’s never had any of those thoughts growing up). It feels like she sees what I’m doing and compares it to herself. If I wear new pants she says “where are they from? How much? Why don’t I buy myself things like you do?”. I got annoyed the other day when she wanted me to get her the same shoes I wear so I said “mum you have your own identity I’m sure there are lots of other shoes you’d like” and it offended her. She tried to clear this with me on Easter, I apologised and she stopped talking to me and it was awkward as hell. Shes used the line “I’m going to establish new boundaries for our relationship [implying less connection etc”. I know I shouldn’t have questioned her identity but I wish I had a mum who had her own taste and timeline. She’s 53. I hate that she holds resentment for so long. It’s awfully tiring and I can’t sleep. Me and my bf can sort issues out more efficiently and it’s so much healthy.

"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I will try keep this short and to the point.
 
 I am part of a friendship group. We've been close friends since middle school and are now in our late 20s.
 
 Amongst this group is L. I have known L since I was about 6. I used to love going to his house on play dates because there were no sense of rules. He's from an incredibly wealthy family who never spent much time supervising him. Play dates at L meant no bedtime, do whatever you want, buy whatever you want, reality did not exist there.
 
 L grew up without ever needing a cent - he was and has always been very generous about spending on his friends, sharing the hedonism, etc. He spent most of his 20s bouncing between various colleges but not completing any courses. He managed to receive a diploma in video game development.
 
 In his early 20s he began to develop this misogyny that has just gotten worse. He is an overt (who thinks he's subtle) pickup artist. He will bounce between his ""tinder boos"", hanging onto them until he's fucked them and then dump them and move on. His father was the same and it's surprising that he does not realize the implications of that kind of behavior.
 
 To get a girl in bed he will use every trick outlined in The Game as well as more insidious techniques. He will tell them they're the one and he loves them. He'll be fucking other girls on the side until he beds his latest conquest, then she gets thrown into the gutter.
 
 This bothers all of us in the group, we don't agree with that kind of misogyny. We give him shit for it, we know it's not right, but he's always been good to us. He's funny to be around. His warped sense of reality can be hilarious.
 
 But now here's the kicker.
 
 L has started working at my company. He's been there for less than a month while I've been there for two years.
 
 These traits of his are coming out very negatively now. He is trying to seduce every girl in the office. He is subtly undermining my authority in the office in front of woman.
 
 At a staff function on Friday (which I left early) he got incredibly wasted, hooked up with a girl from the office (at the same time, cheating on his girlfriend who he was taking out for a Valentine's day lunch the next day), lied to my boss about taking the taxi she ordered for him home and drove himself without bothering to inform any of his friends.
 
 We spent all night stressing and panicking because he was supposed to meet up with us an hour earlier and was unreachable. We drove around the city trying to retrace his steps before finding out he just went home.
 
 I've been paying more attention to his behaviour in the office. He is telling outright lies to people, his intonation changes when he speaks to females - he is simply a different person than the one that we chill with out of work and it's actually become very worrying. When I try call out his bullshit in front of other people, he will either totally ignore it or he reverts to some PUA technique he's memorized about handling conflict.
 
 Last night, another friend of mine asked me some yes or no questions related to L's attitude towards woman, and his attitude in general. I answered yes to every question. Turns out it was an ASPD checklist.
 
 I'm incredibly concerned now. I've never really known what a sociopath was but I think I'm dealing with one now.

Day of walking away from a toxic friendship She scares me Yesterday was the first time I ve felt a sense of self after walking away from a seven year toxic friendship She d conditioned me to rely on her for all my happiness so I couldn t walk away Now thinking about it she scares me She scares me because not only is she a bully and a bitch she s incredibly smart She s scary because she knows exactly how to manipulate others and use them to her whim without them ever saying a word about it It takes an incredibly strong person to walk away from her the only three I know of that have ever broken her hold on them are my best friend one other guy friend and myself There s others who ve seen through her before being drawn in though which takes a very perceptive person to do,"['Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

I m going to be meeting with a friend in eight hours but I m not sure I can pretend today I ve been doing well but have had a small relapse of sleep deprived madness the past few days I m not being hyperbolic either you would be appalled at how I have been conducting myself in private Usually when we hang out it brings me such joy and I can match the energy I am kind and friendly in the most genuine ways but I deliberately avoid showing even the slightest sign that anything is wrong Why Because she s a girl That reasoning might make you upset That s fair honestly I ve just found that on a subconcious level girls will only tolerate negative emotion from other girls There s probably other factors at work of course and I desperately want to be wrong but Gathering more evidence isn t worth the risk But it seems like that will happen today anyway She will know something is wrong and perhaps she will ask No matter how much I refuse it is inevitable I will let something slip She s a very smart girl so it s decently likely she may be aware of her instincts and be able to compensate for them but again I don t want to take that risk At any moment she could cut off contact badmouth me to mutual acquaintances and disappear She knows where I live but the same can t be said for the reverse She must never find out how lonely I am must never find out she is my only true friend must never find out how desperately I need a literal shoulder to cry on I want to be vulnerable but I have too much to lose,"['Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

Just exhausted of continually feeling this way and it s not bound to get any better The past months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me In the time that s passed I ve experienced the following Experienced the end of my first adult love leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me and even if they did they d just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway Lost the majority of my friends after this and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I ve been reluctant to reach out to them Almost didn t graduate from college but barely got by and found myself neck deep in student loan debt Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another This has gotten to the point where I don t even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use Also generally work graveyard hours but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful frequent headaches Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day to a point where I just don t want to deal with it anymore I m just so tired and I can t see this getting any better The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened but as time passed I started leaning more towards it quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won t have to see them because it always ends the same way with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances I don t have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I ve regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back I did want to further my education but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring I think I m at my breaking point I don t know what to do and I don t want to tolerate this anymore I know I m on the younger end of the spectrum and there s the unknown that s waiting for me or whatever but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once I hate to think of using it as an easy way out but at this point I really just don t want to deal with the pain depression and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I need immediate help I m a year old boy and have been heavily depressed and suicidal since I was when I for the first time tried hanging myself I ve been seeking help since age but with no great succes For the last years I ve failed different educations because of my mental condition which is slowly tearing me apart I am constantly imagining guns to my head ropes around my neck the ground smashing my body etc and it haunts me even when I m in a somewhat good mood About a year ago when I help finally came I was by mistake diagnosed as a schizophrenic I had to walk around with this dagnosis hanging over my head and swallow anti psychotics that would eventually make me fall asleep in the middle of every morning classes After a half year I demanded a new diagnosis because I ve NEVER been psychotic After a single conversation with a leading doctor I was diagnosed with dystymia and heavy depressions I was prescribed prozac and when I started on mg things suddenly became joyful I was open hearted I was happy and I had confidence While everything suddenly was going well I decided to drop acid with some friends all of us with an already daily usage of cannabis It was wonderful and for the next weeks I was happy I dumped by girlfriend through years at the time I was certain that I would start from scratch All of a sudden girls were attracted to me I had no problems getting laid and my friends jealousy was a sign to me that I was on the right track I was sure that the days of my suffering had end and I could finally be happy For some reason ONE weekend could destroy all those thoughts I ve had the best days of school ever As another weekend approached everything went great But after the weekend I was back in school and NO ONE seemed as happy as me Suddenly depression hit me I was lonely again Yeah I was happy but no one around me were Ever since then I ve been extremely depressed I m losing friends and I m losing my grip It seems to all start over again For the last month I ve tried suicide times Last time yesterday My only will is to die in peace I am a lonely soul,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"So within the past couple months ive came to the realization that I have to deal with my borderline and bipolar. 
 
 Been out of the dating scene for two years after a string of awful relationships. Me and this girl have talked as friends everyday for 6 months been dating for 3, and it’s great overall I love her very much. 
 
 With the new relationship ive found myself creeping into old thought patterns and codependency. I’ve never been to a psychiatrist or anything, just been obsessed with personal development since I was 14. It’s hard to deal with because logically she has done nothing to trigger these emotions.
 
 I thought I had these aspects of myself dealt with and released but there’s still more. I find myself worrying about every little change in energy or if she will just get bored and leave me. I feel as if I never do enough when I give my absolute all. It’s very confusing and I struggle on my end to not resent myself.
 
 I can’t afford going to therapy or anything but, I’m just wondering if anybody feels the same or has any advice. I really do love this woman and refuse to let bpd run me, it’s just so hard having the “flip” and spinning thoughts over nothing about someone you know cares about you.",['Cause of Distress'],medium
The time I almost got fired for pretending Garfield s favorite food was Spaghetti I originally wrote this in the comments of this post https www reddit com r confessions comments jwulcn anytime garfield comes up in conversation i felt it deserved to be posted properly i used to work at an ice cream shop near a plaza and some docks my boss was from communist romania he loved to remind us he had come here and established his own business i was one of maybe six employees and was fifteen at the time the work was pretty awful the actual shop part was a breeze but once a week we had to unload a wheeler full of frozen duffle bags full of ice cream boxes only half of which had handles id guess the bags were maybe pounds each that s awful already considering im a teenage girl but the truck was also like and it was usually like outside so id go into the truck throw the bags into the back of a pickup and then get out and sit in the back while the driver took us about minutes away to the walk in freezer during that drive i d sweat but once we got to the freezer the sweat would freeze then melt on the way back then freeze in the truck then melt again i used to have icesicles coming off of my hat and ponytail the whole truck would take maybe hours with four of us we didnt always get four and we had to empty the bags and sort the boxes in the freezer with almost no light so yeah maybe the worst job ive ever had To be clear I definitely don t hate the guy man was one of the friendliest people I ve ever met but maybe he shouldn t have hired a teenager to help handle the really difficult parts of his business I mention all of this because context is very important here He used to sit in the back for the first half of the day doing computer shit criticizing us throwing things if we cursed near customers and during his lunch break he would eat a ham and mustard sandwich while reading the comic strip section in the newspaper and laughing like santa claus but his mouth was ALWAYS full after he left and we went into the office to grab the keys you could see the wall he faced that had pictures of his family on it just covered in yellow mustard spittle like a shotgun spread anyway if one of us walked past him during that window to take the trash out or go on break or something he would always pull us aside and point at it laughing usually saying the punchline that got him There was of course one glorious exception BAAHAHA THE GARFIELD CAT He NEVER pointed out the punchline I think he just liked how he looked or something He did say HE HATES ZE MONDAYS sometimes too but mostly he d just roar out GARFIELD CAT and lose his mind choking on his sandwich sometimes Anyway this time I had JUST gotten in from like six hours of grueling ice cream truck freezer dufflebag HELL and as soon as I walked through the door he GRABBED my shirt and pulled me down laughing splattering mustard in my face laughing about garfield Now at this point I was just about fucking done His breath stank I was sweating and shivering not to mention this was all for minimum wage I had done the garfield bit twice before but not so die hard I d fuck with them for a minute or two then burst out laughing This time it was WAR I burst out laughing too instantly winning me an oscar and returned volley AHAHAA the SPAGHETTI CAT He stopped in PLACE No more laughing no more mustard He turned to me genuinely shocked at my misunderstanding You not mean the Lasagna he asked I shook my head looking at him quizzically instantly snagging my second oscar No no Garfield s favorite food is definitely spaghetti He grumbled about it searched the paper but that strip didn t mention it The next day I came into work though he was VERY quick to grab me again pretty much YANK me over to the desk and point out that TODAY S paper had a picture of the lasagna that Garfield was eating unfortunately for him it did not have the word lasagna written I claimed it was spaghetti he was very visibly frustrated but then we had a rush and he let me go The next day same deal but this time it had it written I had the balls to just laugh and say Wow this is a really elaborate joke you re pulling on me and he went BALLISTIC NO the PAPER SAYS LAH ZAGG NAH NOT SPAH GET EE He was very adamant about it for the rest of the shift not even caring that customers were there but I acted TOTALLY unfazed by it I d scoop their cones and checkout all while he trailed me like HOW CAN YOU THINK THE GARFIELD CAT EAT SPAGHETTI THERE IS NO NOODLE and I d reply with some total BS and confuse frustrate him even more I finally broke near the end of the day HE STAYED LONGER TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH ME when he whispered to himself Does poor girl not know difference Her mother I just couldn t take it I laughed for like two seconds but he caught on I think his phrasing was YOU YOU HAVE BEEN A TRICKING ME and he started bellowing about it again We both fuckin cried about that for maybe an hour and we closed early Before I left he said I was Very funny girl but I was lucky he found out it was a joke because he was losing sleep over it and he couldn t handle working with me I laughed again and we said goodbye I got a new job a few months later with much better pay and less manual labor and he bought me some spaghetti from the pizzeria across the street as a parting gift on my last shift labeled lasagna Jesus that s a long post but it s one of my favorite stories glad to have it catalogued somewhere Hope you guys enjoyed reading haha,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress',

HOOOOOOOOLY FRICK I JUST STEALTHED BACK UP TO MY ROOM WHILE MY MOM WAS AWAKE BUT ALSO PEED IN MY UNDERWEAR So lemme start with a basic layout of the house My computer is in the basement my mom sleeps on the living room couch and my room is on the second floor The stairs that go from floor to floor are right next to where my mom sleeps I was on my computer in the basement playing a game that didn t end till AM when my bedtime was AM I turn off the lights when it hits so if my mom looks at the door she can tell I m not awake The game finishes at three and I shut everything off But the moment I do that I hear my mom get up to go to the bathroom from above me I realize I lost my shot to go upstairs seamlessly Also I suddenly really had to pee My first thought was Oh god oh heck oh frick I NEED TO PEE So I began devising a plan to get to my room where there is a bathroom I first thought to wait a couple minutes to hopefully hear her snore As I m waiting I try to think of a safety net excuse to lighten the blow I strip to my underwear so that if I were caught I might have a slim chance of explaing that I couldn t fall asleep and I was getting a drink or something minutes pass no snoring I hear her shift on the couch again I really need to pee at this point it s go now or die I begin heading up the stairs and as I hit the rd to last step I hear a couple of drops of liquid hit the carpeted stairs Thankfully it really was only a couple drops I look to see with my phone light that my underwear is now streaked with urine Cool deal with that later I continue heading up the stairs and I finally reach the same room my mom is sleeping I need to pee now I quickly yet quietly walk to the bathroom that my mom just used which is right next to the living room and relieve the urge that has been there for so long At this point I think I screwed myself There is now way she didn t hear me go to in the bathroom I wait a couple min and decide to just go I walk past her as quiet as possible Quickly crouch and climb the stairs on all fours the stairs that go upstairs have a foot wall of one side that block her vision and finally get to the second floor I see my room I pretty much made it I walk to my room silently and successfully make it without her noticing Now I wait till morning to see if she really didn t notice,['Mood Tracking'],low

Is this actually DBT or is this just bad therapy for depression My therapist s response to I wish I could die without affecting anyone else was Well that s impossible Of course people who love you would miss you I would miss you It would be devastating That seems little short of guilt tripping I won t say it s totally ineffective but I kind of expected more from a DBT intensive therapist Or does DBT assume that the greatest motivation is positive attention Because it totally leverages the therapuetic relationship like it means more to me than anything else in the world Like Sorry you re ok and all but you re just my therapist I don t even know you Self harm has been officially unamed unacceptable and is punnishable by hours of no contact no phone coaching Phone coaching the thing they re supposed to try to get you to use instead of trying again to kill yourself If somebody s so desperate they re self harming possibly with intent to kill You can totally fix it by leveraging the need for continued attention against the need to feel better at any cost For the love of god why is there the assumption someone really just wants attention more than anything and if they get it for being good presenting as asymptomatic and not for being bad symptomatic they ll stop self harming or attempting suicide being symptomatic You cannot just manipulate me out of being suicidal That s not how this works I came to DBT for a robust empirically proven form of therapy that is supposedly heavy duty or industrial strength or whatever Supposedly perfect for severely depressed chronically suicidal people That s what I came for but I m not sure what it is that I m getting It assumes people are illogical attention motivated children above all else While I m not some mastermind genius I find that pretty insulting What do I get a gold star for each day without self harm too I know Let s go full out in behaviorism and do a token economy s I m studying psychology and neuroscience and this shit does not jive with what I ve been taught to expect of DBT I m disappointed really Flat out salty That and it s full of jargon that I can hardly begin to parse out My therapist says I need to work on my Committment to Living like it s a proper noun or something Oh and Mindfulness as a cure to everything including all misery of existence I don t like mindfulness I actually kind of hate it and the deep breathing bullshit too It doesn t work I don t like this toolkit I don t like this therapy and I hate this life Treatment resistant depressive Nothing works Not even a little,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking']",high

"I am someone who has older parents than most people, my Dad is 44 years older than me and my Mum is 40 years older than me, I am in my mid teens.They have had heated arguments years ago, and they used to happen very occasionally. If they were a few years younger they would have got divorced, I am sure of it. There is no doubt in my mind that they do not love each other, or at least not anymore. Over really simple things they just yell at each other constantly, and recently its happened for four days straight, very long arguments.I absolutely hate it. It makes me cry away to my room and shut the door tight and put on headphones so I do not hear a word of what they are saying. I want nothing more than for them to stay together and not spilt up, for the sake of the family. If they divorce I do not know what side to take, but I know them well enough to tell that they will make me choose one.I am well aware that divorced parents is a very common thing. I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other, but clearly I was far from right. I recently have felt the urge to step in myself and just tell them both to shut up and get along, and have even considered buying flowers for my Mum and telling her it was my Dad so that they would hopefully calm down or something. It sucks, it really does. I just want them to like each other again. Hearing your parents fights everyday is just the worst.",['Cause of Distress'],medium

I m just gonna not make any sense here for a while I really don t know what s wrong with me I ve always been like this the tiniest argument or foul word will completely destroy me I never talk to anyone because I m terrified of rejection or disapproval But the strange thing is when I do talk people seem to like me My best friends would tell you or rather have told other people that I have no personality I simply act like whoever I m hanging out with and they re true I hang out with people because it makes me feel normal but most of them only talk to me because they think I m normal It usually takes about a month or so of knowing someone before they realize I m different than who I pretend to be and slowly cut off every tie we have So then there s alcohol Alcohol is what I turned to a few weeks before the only person in the entire world who understood me hung himself to death while masturbating So that s how my cousin died he was pretty much a big brother he always around the only other DUDE in our family Dead as shit naked with a god damn belt around his neck So then there was my girlfriend I started dating her a few weeks later and not until two years later did I find out she was an actual nut She was insane and would always scream at me and throw beer bottles and shit because she didn t think I loved her and for some dumbass reason I kept trying to convince her I did because for some dumbass reason I did love her and all the while feeding my alcoholism Then she ran off with my best friend feeding him the same lies about me she fed me about her ex boyfriend about how I beat her and hit her every night to the point she was actually describing things that she did as if I did them So I broke up with her terribly and moved back home where I am now facing a year of jail for getting a DUI that violated my probation for psychedelic mushrooms that weren t even mine And although real life for the past three years has seemed like mindless distractions from thinking about killing myself I ve only ever seriously considered it three times and every single time i regret not killing myself I always wait around hoping things will get better and all of a fucking sudden I just lose a handful of friends who probably never fucking liked me to begin with and I m going to jail or somebody s dead All I can think about is if my cousin just hadn t fucking killed himself I could because my family can t take another trauma I hate being like this but craziness runs in our family especially in the males I have a high IQ which I view as like having a quad core processor on a linux computer with MB ram designed to do nothing but word processing The only things I m good at are making music which will never make me any money and talking to people which is simply something I m completely good at fucking faking And on top of this I don t have any money we are literally fucking poor I make bucks an hour and my dad makes minimum wage the only reason we haven t lost our house is because my Grandma who leases it to us stopped charging so they could afford lawyers to cover up the fucking shame they feel like I ve shat all over their family I m twenty one Only twenty fucking one not even almost twenty two How much longer will it be before my fucking brains starts being normal again,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Might as well post my story here My troubles started late last year At around the time I was starting work an ex employee came on to the property and started shooting people He would end up killing one injuring then killing himself I never heard any of the shots I never saw people running I only heard on my walkie talkie Call shots fired I couldn t believe it I looked at my coworker he looked at me and we got moving He got people in one direction I went in the other and we started letting people know that we had to get to safety We all gathered in the designated emergency safe zone and for the next few hours we would be there wondering what was going on Wondering what happens next Wondering if we d be found by the police or the gunman We didn t know he killed himself soon after it started We didn t know if this was some crazy guy or a terrorist attack We didn t know if he was alone But for hours we sat in that room And for hours we would know only the fear of the unknown This was the second time in my life I d been through this The first was in high school My senior year This time however noone would be hurt I have always been thankful for that fact I don t know much of the details of that shooting only what I heard from the people that were in the cafeteria that day What I heard was this A male student angry about a breakup came into school with a gun to kill his ex He got things started by firing into the ceiling of the cafeteria He fired a shot from his semi automatic and gun Then he pulled the slide back and fired into the ceiling again Then he pulled the slide back on more aimed the gun at his ex and pulled the trigger His gun jammed No bullet came out He dropped the gun and ran He made it a few blocks before being tackled to the ground by the French teacher For a long time I ve been thankful that this guy didn t actually know how a handgun was supposed to work I know all this now At the time it was just like when it happened on the job For hours we huddled around the class no idea that it was over No idea that no one had actually been hurt Just the knowledge that someone came into the school and started shooting and the fear that we would be found by a gunman rather than police That fear then only affected me for a few weeks Returning to normal would be a short process then I don t even remember much besides not going to school the next day This time has been different This time the fear has had a profound effect on me that I simply haven t been able to shake I find myself thinking about it all the time Being in that place of fear and ignorance of what would come to pass And the unshakable feeling of worthlessness that comes from feeling this way despite never having been in actual danger I was never in the same room as the gunman in either time I wasn t close enough to even hear the shots But I still fear these events happening again I imagine most people won t ever go through what I ve been through once in there life let alone twice At least not in civilian life But all I can feel is that there will be a third for me It feels like an inevitability that I will find myself in that situation again But I feel like the third will be the last It s given me this sense of an invisible clock on my life One I can feel but not see or read One that says I will be murdered in a random act of violence and not of old age peacefully I m not alone completely though My wife was in that same high school My wife knows the fear of being there wondering what happens next Wondering if anyone got hurt If I got hurt And she knows the fear of wondering if I d make it home that day Sometimes I feel like shes the only one that really gets it I wish this were my only problem The fear soon turned into depression Depression is something I know I m familiar with the desire to simple stop existing I know the pain that comes from wishing to God that life would just end for me so that my loved ones could cope with my loss rather than my commitment The shame of these thoughts is something that I ve dealt with on and off for a decade now What s new to me is this horrifying feeling of rage and hatred that the depression seems to have manifested into I hate every single human alive right now Myself more than any I hate myself for the hatred that I feel towards you reading this right now The hatred I feel towards my neighbors and co workers Toward my own family These are the feelings that scare me more than anything I feel them every night as I try to sleep These horrifying thoughts make it difficult to sleep I ve never been an angry person But now it s something that I feel so much of I m losing sleep over it and I feel that s making things so much worse The last issue I m going to mention is a drug I m taking It s a drug called methotrexate I started taking it in December It has some pretty bad side effects for some people Some people take it with very little side effect I take the drug once a week on Saturdays When I take the drug I feel nausea abdominal pain head aches and ridiculous levels of fatigue I usually sleep around hours on Saturday because of the fatigue I think beyond these the drug may be affecting me psychologically I don t know how to verify besides by not taking the drug today If that s all I have to do to go back to normal then that s what I ll do I m just scared that won t be enough I started therapy in January He was quick to diagnose PTSD but no method of treatment has been offered yet I know these things take time though He also recommended coming off the medication After writing all this I don t even know what to expect people to say Generic Just hang in there bro I don t know Maybe some one else I can talk to would be helpful I feel a little better having written all this out like I could go to sleep without rage I scare myself lately In this moment I don t want to hurt anyone I feel like I should take myself out while I m like this so I don t hurt anyone else I m scared of getting locked away in a ward too The loss of wages alone would be devastating I don t think anything good would come of that I don t want to put my wife through that I just want help I m scared of help but I know that s what I need I just don t know where to really get it from I m so scared of you reading this finding out who I am and reporting me as dangerous That my life will be ruined because I sought help But I can t let fear stop me or I will die and it may not be alone It s that simple But I m still so scared right now,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress',

Bad at titles I just feel like tonight is really it for me It s been a rough year for me I ve been stuck at the same crappy job now for years and I m just stuck I m stuck needing to help my mother who didn t have a job for a long time and only now is making slightly above minimum wage And yeah a big part of it is that I m alone My first relationship ended horribly lying cheating etc So after one or two other failures I spent the next few years not trying to date sticking to casual stuff and not wanting more Then I was set up with a girl who really changed my views on it She seemed to actually care and made me want more for myself she wasnt like girls I d been with before We were together about a year before I found out she had been sleeping with several of her coworkers To say the least it crushed me Every thing she ever told me that made me rethink my life suddenly faded away Now everything seems like it was a complete lie And now to make things even worse she is starting at my workplace in a week It just hurts because she was the first girl I trusted in a long time She started to heal old scars and then turned around and made them even worse and left me wondering if literally any second of the last year was what I thought it was I ve always struggled with depression but this year just seems to be kicking my ass I really feel like I have no hope in life anymore I ve always struggled with an alcohol problem and over the last year I admit I ve gotten much much worse I dunno These probably don t even seem like big deals but to me they are,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Not sure if I should be hospitalizedI ve been going through some issues with an ex this week that led me getting hurt a lot There aren t many other times where I recall being in so much distress and where life seemed so unbearable I ve tried to kill myself multiple times over the last couple days as well as this morning I felt like trying again most of my time at work and then towards the end of my shift it felt as if this burden was magically removed for no apparent reason I don t know if this has ever happened to anyone else It makes me feel happy obviously because I don t feel the pain I felt before but at the same time I know myself well enough that something could trigger those feelings again I want to start seeing a therapist but I feel like it wont help as much if they don t know the full scope of my issues At the same time I feel like it would seem weird for me to go to the hospital now when I m feeling perfectly calm Not really sure what I should do Edit I m also really hesitant to be hospitalized because I just moved to a new city kind of far from home and started a new job and I m afraid if I have to stay in the hospital for too long I ll lose my job I also don t want my mom to find out because she s already been through all of my previous suicidal episodes and I can t imagine the anxiety it would cause her now with me being so far from her,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"idk what to do here and could really use some advice
 
 i was seeing a nurse prac for adhd, which i was diagnosed with in elementary school. max dose of adderall did nothing to help me so he told me i should get neuropsychologically tested 
 
 i just had my last one, it was a pretty lengthy questionnaire. i guess i’m in denial about a lot of the issues i have, specifically with anger and pretty much how i view myself 
 
 i just found out about bpd from dr daniel fox on youtube (lmao) and went on a binge, and damn, so many things i KNOW i underplayed on this test were brought up in some of these vids. 
 
 paranoid ideation (ive had a handful of insane episode ive always had trouble explaining) absolute gut wrenching obsession with any romantic interest, lack of self, seething hatred that i keep inside and im in denial of, this numb void feeling in my chest, constant disassociation, this is all stuff i guess i always just accumulated to my personality or bc i was just a weird freak, that i always underplay. 
 
 do i bring this up? how do i tell her i wasnt completely truthful to myself or the test? this isnt a therapist i’ve seen a bunch, we sat for 3 sessions and did a bunch of pattern related tests, memory, attention, etc. and only got to talk about personality issues in the last 15 minutes of the last in person session. 
 
 man idk i just dont want to be misdiagnosed because i was in a state of self delusion. but i dont want to seem like im fishing for something specific. i wish they talked to me a bit more :/ is this common for anyone else who’s gotten a diagnoses? will they know regardless?","['Seeking Help', 'Progress Update']",medium

I am a make and I am 16 and I just broke up with my gf. When I was little I was touched by a girl in my school and she kept doing it even after I said no. Although I told my close friends what happened they told me I was a loser and that I should have liked it. Sometimes when I go to sleep at night I can still hear there voices telling me I am a loser and my recent relationship did not help. During the relationship I felt like I was more of a therapist than I was her boyfriend and she dumped all of her problems and issues on to me and expected me to be able to make her feel better every time. This made me feel horrible about myself because anytime I did not make her feel better we would have an argument and then he would say she was wrong and apologize. We have had more than 60 arguments over our 6 month relationship. And anytime I would ask my friends if I should break up with her they would say no. But during my last two weeks of school my parents told me I could not call anyone or play games so my grades would stay up. The same friends that told me not to break up with her told her to break up with me for not talking to her. I broke up with her because she wants me to give her 6 hours a day and anytime I ask for time to myself she would see upset. I hate myself right now and I do not know why. I have cut myself multiple times and have to pretend like everything is ok when in reality I am 5 seconds away from breaking down. I do not want to seem emotional because I feel like my friends are just going to tell me I am overreacting and it is not as bad as I am making it. I am scared to tell my parents because I feel like they will see me differently. If anyone could give me some help I would love it or at least some advice on what to do I would love it.

I think I need to check myself into a hospital I need your guys advice weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder It wasn t really news I ve known I ve been depressed for years approaching years now I got prescribed Zoloft and I m up to mg now I ve also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about weeks now Its not working though If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse and it feels like it s not even getting worse at a slower rate Over the last few years I ve made a lot of changes to try to help I went from to I started eating healthier I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects I transferred colleges since the first one wasn t working out I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends I even attended my first college party after years of never being invited to anything Now I ve finally gone to get professional help both psychologic and psychiatric And none of it has helped If anything its only gotten worse since I don t even have the hope that any more changes will help The hope is gone When I was a kid I used to get Pneumonia a lot I had it like times before I was I wish I d have just died back then I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me The latest I think I would be happy if thing has been getting in a relationship I think I m thinking this is the latest thing since its one of the only changes I haven t yet made and because I pretty genuinely hate myself I ve pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA I don t really believe in inherent self worth I m almost now and haven t ever been on a date let alone received a non platonic hug Nobody ever expresses interest in me I always have to initiate thought I ve found this is usually the case with my friends as well if I don t initiate I d never get invited to anything I can t even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit It s not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to It feels like all the changes I ve made over the years have amounted to nothing I m just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time I haven t been able to cry in years so I just self harm when I feel like crying It s not the best release and it feels like it has diminishing returns since lately it doesn t give me the rush it used to it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense Besides it beats drinking heavily like most normal people my age do though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers It feels like I ve gotten left behind on the road of life Everyone is dating some are already married with people they love I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I ve started dating yet I keep trying to explain to him that I m trying but not having any luck Whenever dating comes up that s all I ever get I m sure you ll find someone eventually Thing is none of the I d might be happy if things before have obviously failed but this is the only change left I can make since professional and medical help has failed I don t enjoy anything anymore Dota and CSGO feel like chores EU is too frustrating now I ve already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through I don t enjoy running or hiking as much now and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year I don t have any shows I really enjoy I ve always wanted to learn to draw I m actually a huge fan of furry art but I m pretty bad and I m a perfectionist so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can t do it and get better Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better The logic I mean with get better is that zero is still larger than a negative number so I d be better off I used to think Ok I ll wait until I turn and then I ll kill myself if things haven t improved However as things have deteriorated I ve moved that up to More recently I ve moved it up to after graduation I m thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself I don t even know how I m going to make it that far Suicide feels inevitable at this point like its something I have to do I don t buy the whole it gets better thing anymore Its been over years It really doesn t in my experience All the medical advice I ve been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself I don t understand to what end though Like if I don t kill myself now then what I get to continue hurting tomorrow The only end this seems to lead to is why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum I don t see the appeal in it I think once I do it I ll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night Nobody would notice I m gone possibly for a few weeks nobody would hear a thing I might not even be found My body can feed some scavengers I don t have to hurt anymore people who love me don t have to see me hurt anymore everyone wins I ve been dead inside for years its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up Of course this is still likely a few years away so I m probably not at immediate risk of killing myself So thats where I m standing It s AM right now and I can t sleep anymore because I went to bed at last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again The Zoloft just gives me headaches makes me hungry and gives me constipation Nothing has helped and I don t think I can get better anymore I have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon I don t know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point What should I do,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress',

I guess this is it I always knew that I d end up in the obituary section of a small town newspaper My grieving parents would find a picture of me maybe one from high school and it would be pasted in grayscale between Doris Smith survived by seven grandchildren and Emory Deacon who succumbed after a long illness People would see that I was only and wonder what happened Was it a car accident The poor dear probably had something terminal It s a shame to see someone die so young Is it I m years old and I don t remember what it s like to be normal This dusty room and my elderly parents are all that I have left in the world The anxiety is constant and the panic attacks even happen when I m sleeping The doctor s office smelled like Lysol and the nurse didn t mind when I cried The white pills make me drowsy and the small green ones make me sweat I can t stop grinding my teeth but they say I m getting better now I accept that I m dying and offer this as my final testament Paradise is understanding Words are better wasted than unspoken I would have named my daughter Adeline I can t stop grinding my teeth and I would have named my daughter Adeline,"['Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

I don t think it will ever end For context I am a year old male Growing up I was always the life of the party Sure I drank more than my fair share but i was never angry or abusive Everyone loved me I can t think of a day that i spent alone years ago i decided to take my ex back We had broken up years prior for numerous reasons i told myself i had forgiven them We caught up talked apologised and a couple of months later they moved interstate and moved into my apartment with me A couple of weeks later the fighting started The fights were over drugs them not me and not working Getting tired of being the only one trying in the relationship i cheated Honestly i know it wasnt my smartest move but i did it I kept it a secret I found out my SO had cheated on me and i berated them and yelled at them knowing full well that i had done the same One night whilst fighting my SO punched me in the head In that exact moment i became withdrawn reclusive introverted I stopped talking to friends and family I stopped leaving the house A month later i admitted that i had cheated My SO went through my computer including social media my phone everything They texted everyone and posted all over the internet what i had done This has been ongoing for the last months now They still do drugs pot and meth and everyday i am yelled at screamed at I only go to work I don t leave the house for any other reason I have tried to But i came home to holes in the walls My things smashed When we argue they take my bank cards my public transport cards They have thrown out my passport and ID I am the only one who works Everything is in my name I can t leave I can t throw them out on the street I can t be that person Not after what i did in the beginning I can t leave they will destroy my life The only thing i can think of is just going I don t want to but i don t see any other way,"['Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

Do people with lived experience of suicide attempts make a difference for people who are suicidal As a person with ideation and previous attempts I know that people who could relate to my pain helped me to feel less alone and more connected Sometimes they came off as self serving and not really caring about anyone but themselves Sometimes a bit condescending as well What s your experience with this Have you ever talked to someone who was not part of the system that has lived experience Was it helpful Did it help with self stigma did anyone like this talk to the family to help them understand and be supportive,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Mood Tracking']",high

I m not suicidal but I need some help and advice I really hate living at home with my parents I m and without a job because I was convinced by my parents to go to TAFE and get more qualified to go into the industry that I love but now it has left me over qualified for anything that I apply for and since the tech industry is small in my country the market is empty I apply for ANY job and I mean anything retail cleaning and janitorial sales and marketing Shit I don t even know a thing about just because I want a job so everyone can stop rubbing it in my face and making me the butt of all their jokes even though i m trying as hard as I can I m also told that I can t have an opinion on anything I tell them that they can save money by shopping at a store we have here called Aldi as apposed to Woolworths and I just literally get told this verbatim from them You can t have an opinion on this subject i m told that I can t give them suggestions because I don t have a family i also have some problems with them accepting a phobia I have where I can t leave the house by myself without having a mini panic attack here is the story of what happened pasted from another thread gt About years ago A friend and I were walking home from a coffee shop We would have been about at the time and I spotted someone that I recognised It was a person that I had been having dramas with at school and he was running full tilt at me Luckily for me I was walking past my school at the time and it was open for a play they were putting on I ran as fast as I can into the school and got a teacher called my parents to come pick me up I should also explain why I was having dramas with this particular person Myself and his brother who was in my year both have hated each other for about years before all this happened One day he stole my phone and I knew where he lives so we went to his house and got the phone back I later learned that his mother had sent him to live in another state with his father because of that and now his brother blames me for it Ever since then his brother has hated me and now I have really bad anxiety every time I leave the house I can t catch the bus home from TAFE because he rides the same bus as me and he gets off after me We don t live far apart stops so I get worried that he might get off and hit me Whenever I talk to my parents about it they just tell me to get over it because He probably doesn t care about you anymore and call me a pussy and faggot but where I live we have had a recent spat of one punch deaths and it makes me scared to be put in that position where my life could end with one punch and it frightens the hell out of me So instead of catching the bus straight home it s not walking distance I go and see movies and my parents pick me up from the theatre but they have stopped doing that because it is a minor inconvenience to them I have told them why I do it but again they shrug it off It s not like I m depressed though I would never take my own life and the fear actually is because I don t want to be put in a situation where my life could end I m actually a generally happy person I have some really good friends Who I haven t told about this because we really don t talk about problems and I have made some new ones at my TAFE course I have anxiety and it runs in the family but no one understands how I feel because mine was caused by something other than just thoughts and it seems like they quite frankly don t care I don t want to talk it through with him because I don t want to run the risk of reminding him just in case he did forget about me So I want to move out but I don t want to live with other people I don t trust I live off of Centrelink welfare payments while I find a job but it won t be enough for a decent living out of home especially me living in Sydney one of the most expensive cities in the world I don t ever swear around my parents EVER I feel it is disrespectful to swear around people but it has driven me today to tell my mum to fuck off and say it multiple times today because of how they make me feel So that is how serious I feel I asked a GP about the anxiety and stuff and she referred me to a psychologist but it s WAY too expensive and my parents won t help me with the money because they don t give a shit anyway I guess I just want some advice on my current situation and just want to reiterate I don t have suicidal thoughts I love life most times Just when i m home life drags me down when I m reminded that i m useless for wasting my life so far,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

How to help my best friend with her depression suicidal thoughts My roommate is my best friend of almost years and we have lived together for about a year now We have both always struggled with depression but she struggled with suicidal thoughts a lot more than I did and she has been to multiple therapists and has been on medication since she was a teenager She hasn t seen a therapist in over years so she s been on the same low dose Zoloft prescription since then She was also admitted to the hospital on suicide watch when were in high school She has always been very adamant about the fact that she is going to kill herself at some point in her life and how she doesn t care if she dies When we talk about anything related to death car accidents coronavirus murder etc she will bring up how she doesn t care at all if she dies and she welcomes it Today she had about shots and we got into an argument about it because she was saying some concerning things about drinking about how she could drink the whole bottle and she would be fine it was a liter bottle and doesn t care at all if it damaged her organs cus she s gonna die at some point anyways And when I proved to her on the internet that it would kill her she just shrugged and said it s ok if I drink it all it s because I want to die and then I started to get upset and she said don t worry I would never kill myself if you were going to still be alive and be sad about it but if you died or something then I would probably go for it She says that she has just always felt like this and no matter what I say in return she refuses to say anything other than I know my brain and I know that it won t ever change I told her she needs to go back to therapy and even offered to pay for it but she said that she s been to years of therapy and already knows exactly what they ll say so there s no point I told her it s not normal to feel that way for your whole life We argued about it for a while and she just says the same thing over and over and over again I know my brain completely and I know it will never change Over and over it s her only argument I don t know what to do She had an incident a few months ago where she got really really close to attempting suicide and she didn t tell me until the next morning and yet she claims now that if she was at a point where she was thinking about it then of course she would tell me But she didn t before so I don t know what to think Thanks in advance I don t really know what to do,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

There s so many ways I could kill myself right at this very moment I ve never noticed this before and it s really scaring me My mind is absolute chaos right now and I don t know what to do Everything I see has potential to kill me Everything And when I close my eyes it s limitless I m young enough that people would say I have too much to live for I feel so fake whenever I try to start a conversation about my depression because it s probably just hormones or being a teenager and then I end up making some half hearted suicide joke and everyone around me feels uncomfortable It s not like I ve ever been diagnosed or anything I know that so many people self harm I know that all of them have real problems and struggles in their lives I don t There s always food on the table and money in the bank and while I may not have enough money to go to college I definitely am a very privileged person I m just looking around the room right now and it s freaking me out I think I m going to cry To be quite honest I shouldn t I ve been crying a lot lately because I m a really weak person and I don t know how much longer I can do this But I still don t know if I could really commit suicide I m such a fake person I probably just self harm for attention too because even though I haven t told anyone I do it I really want to I would love to just sit and talk and talk and talk for an hour straight about everything I would love to tell my story from start to finish You see I m selfish You see how many times I ve said I I m selfish I think something s wrong with my mind It just keeps twisting and turning I don t think it s supposed to do that I can t focus on anything and this post is getting really out of hand I m sorry I just can t concentrate very much I think this is getting really long and I m can t go back to read over this or edit it right now because I can t think properly I m sorry TL DR This was a completely useless post and I can t make my brain shut up Sorry,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking']",high

Failed university thinking of throwing in the towel on life altogetherI ve been pursuing a bachelor s degree for four years now and I just found out I failed classes this semester which means my financial aid will be terminated Without it I can t afford tuition I have no idea how I m going to break this to my parents This was not suppose to happen I was suppose to graduate this spring and find a decent job with a decent wage that would motivate me to pursue professional help to confront my avoidant personality disorder and possibly move out of my parents home I was so so close sigh University was really the only thing I had going for me it was the only redeeming aspect of my life I have no friends no significant other most people would probably consider my lifestyle boring I read books browse the internet workout attend university while making sure to always keep to myself i m basically a hermit I would only venture out of my house to attend classes or the gym I guess the thing that bothers me the most aside from fucking up my future is that I know why I failed it s a mixture of a lot of things really I was studying a major a didn t care for that had lousy job prospects worse part is I chose it I chose it because it required very little math my brain doesn t work well with numbers so my choices were very limited to begin with Some of my peers dropped out after the first year but I kept going passing by doing the absolute bare minimum C s get degrees right I continued despite feeling deeply dissatisfied because my whole life I was conditioned to go to college and obtain a higher education there s a stigma attached to those people who take alternative avenues I m already judged enough by the abnormal life I lead really didn t need to add another thing to the mix Do any of you guys have any advice I have no idea where to go from here Once the anger wears off my parents are probably going to demand I get a job and contribute with expenses which is totally understandable If I was a healthy functional adult I would comply without hesitation but I can t even imagine myself going through the whole interview process much less sustaining a job All I know is how to be a student I suppose not even that I m filled with absolute apprehension when I contemplate my future I m soon to be and I have nothing to show for FUCK,"['Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium
Week of grad school and I m already a failureI started grad school last week I was so excited and prepared already having chapter of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook While I anticipated grad school to be challenging especially when I work a full time job I did not expect this quarantine to make things x harder I thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes Instead I m being buried in emails from school directors and from parents I have to send emails every Monday with homework packets in addition to making phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day along with attending morning teacher meetings With all this extra work and stress of parent complaints because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we re putting in for their kids my anxiety has been through the roof This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork as I m constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough so I ve struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers I procrastinated because I m a fucking dumbass and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school Because of this I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at am It had been due at pm I had no idea that even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time days before the deadline I only procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class My other online class is fine I have an A But now thats my only class which means its going to take me even longer to graduate and I m going to be a fucking underpaid kindergarten teacher forever I m never going to get my PsyD because I m a fucking moron who can t manage her time and swallow her stupid fucking mental issues for important shit like this Its almost am and I ve been trying to calm myself down for the past hours I finally found this place to vent to I hope that s okay My cat is with me so I m not going to hurt myself I m trying so hard to control myself but it s so hard and I m so tired,"['Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

"Hi all! I've been on this sub before, but I left a while back because of the whole, y'know, denial thing that anything is actually wrong and putting blinders on. You know how it is.
 
 I've been a total piece of crap to my husband, who has been my biggest champion for YEARS. I've allowed myself to be a total slave to my illness and basically refused to do anything to better myself. I didn't feel that I needed it, but holy shit I do. On top of that, I've discovered that while not diagnosed, I do actually fit the NPD criteria. Not fun in. The. SLIGHTEST. But it really explains a LOT and knowing about narcissistic rage answers a lot of questions, which helps.
 
 I've lost all of my friends and family and while my husband still loves me and cares for me, he is so hurt by everything I've put him through. I am at a crossroads in my life: I either keep putting fingers in my ears and insisting that I don't need to change, and thus getting divorced and being completely alone, *or*, I can make the damn changes, make amends, and have the family, friends, and husband I love, want, and need.
 
 It's time to make my indecisive ass choose something for once.
 
 For those of you who have successes and have been able to make amends in damaged relationships, and have made changes in yourself; what are some ways I can be better about my illness and more aware of the effect I have without hiding from it? How can I be a better person for the people who love me dearly, but are very tired and hurt?
 
 Thank you so much.","['Cause of Distress', 'Seeking Help']",medium
I envy most of the people on this sub You all have such simple problems like Oh my boy girlfriend abandoned died cheated on me Oh my parents are the worst Oh I am alone Owow my cat died I have no actual friends or anyone who genuinely cares about me I have not the best health I am ugly as shit and on top of all have something like bipolarity or whatever with some shitty skin syndrome because of which I feel discomfort itch and even pain all over my body every single second I never had a girlfriend and to be honest I wouldn t want to be with a psychopath who can actually like such an abomination which is me To top it all I don t have any citizenship and cannot visit a doctor because if they diagnose anything bad they can just kick me out of the country Looking at me you know that this guy has no good future other than maybe working a mediocre low paid job If I were a girl I would never date this piece of shit My best bet is either trying to pursue education and achieve a medium salary workplace with small apartment by the age of at best or fleeing into the woods and living with wildmen If somebody can tell me any reason why I should live you re welcome in the comment section,"['Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

TIL Nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously even your doctors and therapists Everybody thinks you re just being immature or finding excuses for your failures The only time they realise that you re really in trouble and need supports and helps is when it s all too late You might think the professionals would act totally different But the truth is that the therapist I met literally told me to grow up and be responsible and that the doctor I saw more or less implied he couldn t help and wouldn t care as long as it s my life not his child s I m trying to gather the courage to off myself within one or two days Don t want to live through a life I m incapable of living through while nobody cares at all,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Mood Tracking']",high

Stories of people mistaking me for adults Im quite big even though Im and from behind one could realisticly assume a late s early s man was standing in front of them This turns out to be really confusing for some people My dad and I were at a department store that was specialised for tech stuff and we were looking for a dongle for my macbook The store we were in was quite small and you had to squeeze between people most of the time this was pre corona As my dad and I were looking around I hear someone asking how much a terabyte cost Initially I just assumed a middle age man from his voice was asking an employee even if his question didnt exactly make sense hard disk or ssd presumably so I ignored him The guy repeated his question a few times but again I just assumed he was trying to get an employees attention and ignored him Now I was wearing a fluorescent shirt Mistake The employees also wore flourescent Eventually the guy got frustrated and tapped me on my shoulder How much does a terabyte cost Oh I dont work here I say revealing my baby face The confused look on the guys face was a sight to behold and he apologised for being rude We still laugh at this instance today even though its been a few months Never saw the guy again TLDR someone thought I was a store employee I was not My family were at a school function for my brother and at the end everyone went to dinner together For some context my hypersocial mom is friends with most of the parents and teachers present or should I say all of them The dinner starts it was all you can eat and some of the parents start walking around offering wine to other parents its kind of their thing they drink a lot Of course they arent exactly daft enough to offer alcohol to the students Eventually they come round to our table and someone taps my shoulder quite obviously talking to me would you like some wine I look around and the parent behind me burst out laughing They thought I was my dad in this story i was and roughly the same size as my dad My stature had struck again Maybe if they didnt drink so much they could have seen that I was my dad TLDR semi drunk parent thinks im my dad,['Mood Tracking'],low

I feel empty I ve got nothing leftI ve been suffering from depression for a couple of months now It sort of came out of nowhere It made no sense at the time because everything in my life was wonderful and happy and I had no reason to be so miserable Slowly it began destroying everything I tried an SSRI but it made things significantly worse Throughout it all my boyfriend supported me It was so hard for us and it challenged us so much but he stuck by me I told him everything and he supported us throughout Yesterday after what had been a brilliant couple of days he broke up with me We always kept having silly little arguments I know they were triggered by how stressful everything had been because of me but for the most part we had been having such good times and being so good to each other I tried to get him to stay but he wouldn t he d made up his mind I waited until I was in a more sane mood and sent him a long email telling him everything that I felt I know he read it but he hasn t replied I won t send him another I know I shouldn t have done that in the first place I ve tried everything I can think of I ve got anxieties out of nowhere All I can think about is the fact that I need him and that I m nothing without him I spent years in university to qualify for a job that I hate This morning I got an email from a new course that I wanted to start telling me my qualifications were enough that I could do a conversion course Only I can t because since then I got diagnosed with severe depression and it s one of those careers where a history of depression is enough that you re unable to do it And I just want to tell my ex about this and share with him but I can t I know I can t contact him again I ve tried everything I can think of but I can t pull myself out of this I have the stupid irrational sadness from depression and now the logical sadness from this It s all building up so much He was never completely my life I still had friends I ve texted fifteen people One has agreed to meet over the weekend The others are all busy with their own things It s fair enough I ve tried getting out and doing things but it s just no hope I m not improving I m getting worse I no longer know what to do I can t keep going like this,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
"Without going into detail, this diagnosis explains so much. The sudden break ups, severe mood swings, destructive and controlling behaviour - all makes a lot more sense now.
 We have been on and off for the past 7 months since we broke up, but recently we’ve been on and it’s genuinely felt like we’re rebuilding a meaningful connection again.
 She came to me straight away after her psychology appointment to talk to me about it, and what it could mean for us in the future. She shared her insecurities and concerns about it, but also what she knows she can build on within her self moving forward. She told me with confidence that she is willing to give our relationship a good shot again, and I am too.
 Being aware of her diagnosis, we can work together and with help of her psychologist it looks like she’s getting back on track again - and I’m willing to support her through all of this.
 She’s asked me not to tell anyone about this at least until she’s ready, so that’s why I’ve come here to update this subreddit.
 Anyone willing to share any experiences or give any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",['Seeking Help'],medium

Difficult thoughtsSo I m in one of my crisis and just came across here while trying to find something to get my mind off of everything So I guess I ll just post away and hopes it helps a bit So I had a friend She commited suicide in and I got to know only in I was in my last year of high school when I discovered and I had a fight with her Stupid reasons really Mostly not agreeing on stuff that really wasn t important When I tried to talk to her again to apologize or something I got the news It was heartbreaking and I wish I could have done something anything I mean we were both pretty alone at life really And just like that a person that was one of my only friends was gone just like that Nothing I could feel other than the pain it left that I could never talk to her again That all I have now is fucking memories So you d think due to my experience that I d learn something I don t know But even all those years later I just did not forgive myself I m not particularly alone and I KNOW there are people that care That they are with me and all that Still even when people say that I m worth it or whatever I can t seem to believe it All that comes through my mind is how much I fucked everything up for basically nothing and how nothing I could ever do would revert that It s so stupid but yet every once in a while it becomes so heavy and I just don t know what to do I think that I m not worth it That it d be better if everything came to a stop But yet I do believe in the words of the few people that say they care no matter how hollow they seem when I think about it Basically yeah I don t know Honestly I just feel like utter shit and usually I tank this shit alone as I ve always did And I see where it takes me I just wait and see like the stupid coward I am Anyway I m sorry about this I m not sure it all made sense but this is how I m feeling this is how I usually feel when late night comes around and I can t just so something to make it go away Anyway I m sorry if this bothered anyone I just needed to let this out in a different place in a place where I don t have the certainty people will just say that I should let it go already,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I can t stop crying I don t know what to do So everything in life seems to be piling up on me I have a full course load of senior year classes an entire stack of companies that I need to submit job applications to very soon exams and projects coming up two clubs that I m already committed to doing things for and I missed a lot of school last week for a family funeral I ve also been sick for over a week now and I can t sleep more than hours a night even with medicine The thought of food makes me feel sick so I am barely eating The thing that really is hurting me now though is that yesterday I went over to see the guy I was dating already upset and crying and hoping for any kind of comfort only to have him tell me that he didn t want me We were both going to the same party last night and he told me that I shouldn t be around because he thought he had maybe other women he could get with After he spent the night grinding on some girl he met two weeks ago he told me that he wanted to date her and proceeded to tell me everything that is wrong with me both physically and personality wise Looking back now I should have seen something coming over the last week even though we haven t had any fights or anything I m posting this here because when I came back to my apartment last night I spent a long time thinking about how easy it would be to OD with all the alcohol and drugs I have here I do think I probably have some form of depression based on my past history although it s never been diagnosed or treated Fortunately I ve never been tempted to think about this before but this is the closest I ve ever been and the whole idea scares me I just can t see a way to take care of my pile of work and I can t even begin to describe how lonely I am There s no other way to make it all go away and waiting it out hurts too much I don t have a car so it s hard for me to get out of the area and take my mind off things even if I did have time to do so I also don t have a whole lot of friends here most of the people I did know graduated and are already drifting away I called two friends last night but neither of them live remotely close and it didn t seem to help although they did everything they could for me The thing I need most in the world right now is someone to hold me while I cry on them or even just a big hug would probably do wonders I just feel so alone What do I do,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

who kept me alive met more than didn t stay However accummulated a high amount of student loan because of this Currently on hiatus from university even when I just turned weeks ago Met the man of my life in university went through years and a lot of shit together He was my beacon and support for the longest time However this guy left me because he felt like I wasn t going anywhere which was because of inaction or lack of achievements caused by my depression and he lost feelings for me He was unable to empathize with my depression because of the way he was brought up and saw it as laziness or just plain wasting my life away He broke up with me late november in and I m still not over him This experience still has a leading impact on my mental stability I ended up doing many stupid things after some while heavily intoxicated and I can say for certain that I sabotaged any lingering bridges between the both of us He s not a bad person Family are not supportive of my sexual identity As an asian family there were high hopes and expectations on studies and success Also we were mid low class and we don t have much financial sustainability My parents they are not bad people They work hard but they are not highly educated I had to learn a lot of things on my own I have been supporting myself for the longest time even if I still stay with my parents We don t communicate much the times we do are usually very abrasive and I feel mostly isolated and alone Found my passion for the arts and drive in the media broadcast tv industry through several career opportunities in the forms of external ad hoc internships during the times when I was looking for something to do while on leave of absences However the lack of an official paper qualifications led them all going nowhere The last stint ended in end of April when Covid got serious and I was let go because I was expendable Ultimately much experience but very little income and with my age I m unable to compete for entry level jobs with fresh graduates with the right qualifications Besides I have a lot of debts and no money to start another diploma or degree elsewhere which is something at the back of my mind but never able to achieve I have maybe k usd to my name in terms of expendable cash It has been roughly months since I m unemployed and not doing anything and while I m still on hiatus from university I have to decide by the end of the year if I was to continue or terminate my matriculation I m in my final year but I m severely tormented with the idea of forcing myself through for something that I am not wishing to do in the future and that it will take a further toll on my mental health But if I leave it would be years and money wasted I have Right now I m juggling between part time work but even those are scarce and few heavily strenous and I feel like it s not enriching I ve been sending out resumes and applications but always met with rejection I tried seeking remote jobs as well like ways to sustain making money online but always hitting a wall I m basically powering through just to earn some money to sustain myself and it has been a struggle everyday I never thought I was unintelligent but I think my low level of confidence my inferiority complex abandonment issues with the breakup isolation from my family my financial burdens and the hopelessness of not being able to go anywhere in life with so much potential has caused me a lot of mental anguish I struggle with sleep everyday and I wake up everyday feeling worse wishing I did better I d like to think if I was given another opportunity or more resources in life I will have done much better and to never fall into this state Alas everything is always better in hindsight It s easy to say that you re comparing oranges to apples but when I look at my peers or close friends around me most if not all of them are in a better place than me Maybe they were born in a better environment maybe they have met supportive people in their lives maybe they all chose wiser with what they wanted to do in life and here I am feeling stuck and incredously bopeless I know there is definitely someone out there who has it worse off than me but the darkness is so overpowering that I do not know how to continue with life I wonder everyday when is the day I will finally have the courage to choose to go so that I can relieve myself from this pain I m not okay I wonder if you reading this have any resources or pearls of wisdom for me,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive

I ve caused all of my problems yet I can t fix any of them And I m tired of trying When I was I felt so isolated and lonely that I started turning to people on the internet for attention I talked to one guy who convinced me that we were in a real relationship and things happened But because it was all online I convinced myself that there was nothing anyone could do about it so I have kept it a secret for years And it has affected me so badly I ve been thinking about it a lot and it s no coincidence that I have been uncontrollably binge eating the past few days I ve been thinking about it a lot and it s no coincidence that I want to cut a criss cross pattern into my legs I ve been thinking about it a lot and it s no coincidence that I feel like I should take all of the pills I can find and not wake up It shouldn t be affecting me like this it was a long time ago and I agreed to it I knew it was wrong and bad and I went along for months I m partly to blame yet I can t move on And there s no way to fix this It happened years ago I should get over it Instead I m laying here at in the morning thinking of ways to end it all Obviously this is not the only reason It s just the one on my mind right now Another wonderful reason to end it all is that I am in the wrong body That s right buds I m a tranny have fun judging my pathetic life Also I m depressed To be fair most people are But still it just keeps getting worse I ve been waiting years for it to get better even though all of my problems are my own fault I can t fix it and I m pretty sure that I m just too broken So maybe I should just give up,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

It s All My Fault No it isn t Yes it is I m in a strange emotional state right now I don t know how I should be starting my story I don t know what I m supposed to say But I ll try to make it as clear as possible My house has never been one to display much affection Thats not to say we don t love each other or someone is overtly abusive but emotions are not shown very often do I care too much or maybe I don t care at all and I m faking it As a result communication is a major issue and it strains relationships often Another thing to note is that my brother and I are first generation here parents were refugees from Viet Nam My father never graduated high school He began working early and came over to the states as a group sponsored by a church All his life he has done manual labor of some sort and currently works as a mechanic at a self owned although beginning to fail mechanic shop Despite all this he will never ever pass by an opportunity to help someone whether it is through money work or otherwise In my eyes he is practically a saint despite some minor flaws gambling which he has fixed and a little bit of drinking This is because no matter what he will help and expect nothin in return He sees everyone as being equal and will do anyone a favor with a smile on his face even though it may end up costing him Throughout my childhood he was and still is working six days a week from AM to PM at the shop and sometimes even as late as PM He works all day and he works hard even though the business is meager he still does all he can to contribute whatever he can towards our home Because he worked so much I could never see him often and as a child I always saw him as a kind of distant figure that deserved all my respect but I never quite knew why Of course now that I have grown older I fully understand how much he has sacrificed throughout the years in order to give my brother and I what we wanted and what we needed growing up I love him more than words can explain for it and my absolute biggest regret is not spending more time with him and being closer Don t get me wrong he s still healthy and alive but I just wish I could get closer to him but I dont know how At all And it kills me My mother was one of the boat people that fled Viet Nam leaving her parents when she was only At only a week out to sea however her boat was caught up by a Chinese Hong Kong patrol boat and all the members on board were sent to a detention camp in Hong Kong Thankfully because this was towards t he end of the conflict they were able to negotiate her and the others release and passage to America due to political asylum or something I can t recall When she arrived living with her aunt uncle who were already here at the time her first order of business was to get a job and finish high school After that she perservered and went on despite having limited English skills to graduating both college and pharmacy school to become a pharmacist Again my mom is the type of person to go out of her way to help people even if it costs her as evident to the tens of thousands of dollars we constnatly wire back to Viet Nam to aid relatives However she has a quick temper And I mean quick On one hand I guess you could say I m closer to my mom than my dad since she had more education so I could talk with her with more advanced topics and for some reason I could just chat with her better in general but on the other I just felt that there was always a kind of barrier between us as if I had some understood yet unspoken relationship with my dad that I just didn t have with my mom I know this is getting long and I doubt anyone will read it thoroughly I just want to note that at this point I have mostly calmed down and my thoughts are getting more lucid However I feel like writing this is something that I truly need to write to let it out Furthermore the nature of my issue is something that has and probably will recur constantly so while I am in control of my thoughts I figure pre is better than post As you can see from my descriptions I hold both of my parents in very high regards to the point where when I was younger and to a certain extent even now I could see them do no wrong Growing up everything I did I did it to make them happy to please them to constnatly seek their approval And even now I see nothing wrong with that especially when I consider that everything I have now is because they gave up on their dreams or sacrificed their goals in order to provide And I am truly eternally grateful I feel like it is a debt that can only be repaid by living my life through and raising my own children providing them with the same albeit unspoken love and care that my parents have shown me I have learned so much as a person from each of them the foremost being the importance of family and love from my father and the necessity of knowledge determination and respect from my mother Again I cannot fully encompass the gratitude I have towards them and the debt that can never be repaid However this is where the problem begins Even at a young age if my parents ever fought each other or got mad at me or my brother regardless of fault I would blame myself I would not tell them I blamed myself but in my heart I felt that whatever unhappiness that was visited upon them was my fault And thus I always strove to do as they told and avoid upsetting them This worked fine until I d say starting about or years ago when family issues began cropping up As I mentioned earlier my mom was quick to anger and had very low tolerance for mistakes or disrespect My dad is very quiet and softspoken and often will take t he blame in order to diffuse any situation For that respect him immensely Seriously His ability to maintain composure was astounding When my brother began to reach that age where everything and everyone is out to get you a lot of fights broke out in the family because my brother thought my mother was too overbearing and my mother disliked how disrespectful and americanized my brother was becoming Needless to say fights often ended in tears while my father was trying his hardest to calm everyone down and I sat isolated trying to maintain composure but of course blaming myself and trying to find a way to keep the family together As I said earlier from my dad I developed a kind of do everything I can mentality towards my family I refused to become a broken statistic The fights grew in number and volume my brother became more rebellious my father began getting tired etc etc Fast forward to the present I know this is getting long and to be honest everytime I write something I realize I have more to write but keep in mind this is nearly two decades of bottled up emotions that no one has heard

A Story the quest for love has taken it s tollYou have heard the expression it s better to have loved and loss than never to have loved at all Lies what folk often forget is the psychological and emotional toll that multiple failed relationships has on people each one chips away at your mental health and adds baggage that stays with you for most of your life I have no idea what day it is today but I start each morning with tears flooding my face and a crippling desire to not exist anymore I d like to drop my life story here on the offhand that someone somewhere reads this and can relate with me on some level throwaway for good measure brace yourself for a really long read location UK NO Early life I was lucky enough that my family could afford to place me in a posh private school for pretentious wizards Unfortunately this education was wasted on me as my depression unwillingly began when I was thirteen years old yet I could not comprehend what depression was at this age I was also addicted to the video game world of warcraft WoW Both the cloudyness of being down and the constant thought of when can I get home for my fix left me void of motivation to partake in education University life I had zero social skills due to days I had racked up in WoW but somehow managed to land a girl from a club let s call her X X was half British and half Norwegian she was shy family orientated and equally inexperienced in life We did nothing but watch TV the rest of this chapter is boring let s fast forward UK worklife Through the aid of a lecturer I scored a job working for a top US ISP in a data centre hours north where I lived the city was dirty and work gave me crippling anxiety When you re anxious depressed your judgement is clouded colors are less vivid and all food tastes the same I constantly made elementary mistakes which only made the anxiety and depression worse I never focused in school and the stimulation from gaming destroyed my attention span Four years past and although she never vocalize these words X really wanted to start a family X was also an engineer and quite intelligent We had spontaneous intercourse one night and later I worried it could lead to a pregnancy she reassured me it was impossible on her current cycle I return after a twelve hour night shift to discover a positive pregnancy test prominently left on the bathroom counter I was twenty one years old with no life experience shocked and dismayed did I even love X or did I simply love the security a relationship brings I push for an abortion and she reluctantly agrees I know I m an asshole Things get weird nothing is familiar anymore I m tired of my job hate the dirty city and pose the idea to X that we move to Norway she s fluent I m lost what could go wrong Grand adventure I got a job for another US tech company before leaving UK we travel to Oslo with our possessions and Gandalf the dog and ferry and drive our way across UK up Denmark and across to Norway I did not integrate well mostly my fault and the fact we moved based on a semi ultimatum X is unemployed for months We had been dating six years at this point I had an emerald engagement ring X finally gets a programmer job but cheats on me with the guy twice her age who mentored her I spiral hard new country confused lost heartbroken they speak great English in Norway but I didn t know any Norwegian and this blew my anxiety and depression up I drink for a week straight I got into bitcoin and crypto mining as a hobby before it exploded then I discovered this could be used to buy narcotics off the darkweb Twenty six years old and I d never touched a cigarette or drugs other than alcohol I buy benzodiazepines off the darknet This opened the floodgates as it temporarily cured my issues and my quest was to try the rest V Before online dating turned to shit I met V half Norwegian half American lots of fun I kept up the drug routine and expanded my desk draw with a variety of disassociatives psychadelics depressants and stimulants I wanted to move to California with V as our vacations there were eye opening I got denied after roughly job applications serendipitously I got a targeted email from a renowned tech company doing R amp D work in the video conferencing market dream company and dream job depression and anxiety prevail V and I still had fun but I went crazy and occasionally psychotic I pushed V away and we split and then realised I was back to square X this prompted my first suicide attempt using a litre of sambuca mg diazapam and a gram of mdma in the hopes my organs would cook whilst I was in a benzo sleep state I took the pills and put the bottle to my head I passed out before I could reach for the mdma baggy I woke up in hospital ICU hours later When I woke the first thing I tried to do is strangle myself with the beeping machines power cable staff intervened and I was placed in a psych ward for a while The dream The job was perfect I should be happy I was under qualifyied but these people enjoy the stories and bullshit I spew in interviews Two years pass nothing changes I m lonely abuse takes over Usual life is pointless angle I ve tested all the drugs at this point except opioids I order heroin with the sole intention of permanent overdose No toleranse I snort there entire bag I sink into my bed no further I sank through the ground and down into the earth s crust It felt horrible A part of me didn t want to die just sleep forever I call my Swedish friend and explain the overdose he calls and ambulance Hell I wake up in hospital very psychotic everyone is trying to kill me the walls are caving in and extremely colorful smoke floods the room the tv gives reports of a male rapist and the possible suspect is me I feel the hospital is in on the jig and see them trying to take DNA from me blood in an attempt to frame me for this non existed crime why would Norwegian news be in English One night I escape I run far but I don t know where I am or how to navigate the hospital security track me down and escort me back to my bed The next day a tall in stature ripped private security guard appears at my door Yes Finally protection from the nurses with no faces and the snipers outside that I ve been ducking all week Wrong so so wrong I later found out he was there to stop me escaping and to protect the staff from me I cried in broad daylight when I figured this out Doctors told me they ran MRI s in the extended duration I was unconscious to check for brain activity no dignity left at this point Fast forward back to the psych ward familiar faces Realization I was staying in this country simply for the job yet I was still insanely depressed lonely and no ambition to integrate with the knowledge of the fact that I m here only because of X I met another girl called Y we bonded over drugs unfortunately this is what my life has become she was nice but attraction faded we lived together for six months on and off work was getting more intense I was making more mistakes due to the usual three things Y had a hash smoking habit we smoked a lot but I couldn t handle the pressure anymore and I decide to move back to England Familiar land My tech job and incredible manager let me teleconference work from home for a bit whilst I landed on my feet Problem is I never landed I stayed with my mom for a bit she has bipolar and schizophrenia This is after my parents divorce my dad was an esteemed doctor saw the signs tried his best but couldn t help as she did not believe there was a problem but everyone else is looking at the fucking huge elephant in the room I m talking about the mental health stigma not my mom she s only mildly obese She is money obsessed she divorced my dad for cash She knew I had an engineer job and wanted me to fund renovations on the house she got from the cash split in the divorce I did not oblige and called her irrational over some remarks she made Her response was well atleast I haven t been in as many psych wards as you I got mad and flipped a table in the hall nothing got damaged heated reaction She called the police on me for not paying her lifestyle or making noise Anyway her property her rules the really friendly and pretty cool police obliged and drove me to my dad at a secret location due to being afraid of what my mom is capable of I don t want to go down this road but my father lives a lot of secrecy and I could write a book on the psychology that binds his half of the family together New beginnings I rush and find rented accommodation Things seem good I meet a new girl Z Now Z is incredibly rude but I was attracted to her dark and dirty side Relationship moves fast she drunkenly says I love you multiple times but then forgets it happened at the two week mark I meet her entire family we argued over some trivial things she also lived minutes from my home she broke it off after a pitiful six weeks I make new guy friends and the next months go well However depression kicks in full drive I can t focus function I just want sleep or constant sleep I order a bunch of oxy and heroin and this is attempt four shan t speak of three as it was really dumb I nodded out and awake god knows how many hours later which is really confusing and at the time more depressing I can t even off myself how depressing is that I was out for a very long period of time and developed a blood clot or some issue requiring ultrasounds and blood thinners on my leg The next two months were painful Goodbye Tech last October I just couldn t handle the stress anxiety guilt of underperforming so on and so forth So I yolo resigned and went travelling I went through Japan and I went to one of my best friends who lives in Washington US I had an incredible time my friend in US understands me on all levels but our time came to and end I m back home the past three months have been spent laying in my bed in my room abusing myself with zero ambition to even search for a job whilst burning through my savings These four walls will be the death of me I m in therapy once a week by choice this time and I self medicate because I m not only an armchair

"DISCUSSIONS OF SEX, SELF HARM AND SUICIDAL IDEATION S
 
 Saturday night, I went out. Already feeling pretty down. Met a woman at the bar. We went back to her friend's house. Then to mine. Had sexual interactions. I couldn't maintain an erection. So, I was left feeling off. She gave me her instagram details and I sent her a follow request.
 
 She left early the next morning. Then last night. I got super drunk. Gambled and lost a bunch. I tried reaching out to a bunch of people. Then, I turned up at her friend's house. Scared her friend, then I left. I had an implement to harm myself on me. I was going to, with the intention of finality, when I saw a message from a friend I'd called earlier. I called him. He talked me down and I went home. 
 
 This morning. The girl who stayed over told me she'd had fun, but what I did was unacceptable. She wanted no further contact and was considering filing a police report. 
 
 I completely agree. I apologised and told her I understood. Then asked if she could contact the police. I unsent that message and she has since blocked me.

I am nothing I have nothing My husband has been having his last night of drinking for three months After years of problem drinking This excuses maxing out my card his card spending every dime including change from penny jar getting deposits back at the beer store it s always the last night so do your worst right For weeks I ve worked overtime shifts from am and again from pm midnight just so we can pay bills I literally sleep non consecutive hours each night I m a teacher he hasn t been to work since the rd because of medical leave AKA he was hungover two days running and then has been drinking every day since I have to fast for the next weeks which is actually ok I ve done it for weeks before but also necessary because we don t have any food He s skinny and can t skip meals I m a fucking fatass which is probably partly why the only man who wanted me is a useless horrible drunk My friends have homes have families He s alienated me from everyone I no longer speak to anyone in my family after one nightmarish drunken episode after another I have no friends I have become a drunk too at first it was to cope and then it was to keep him from having every drop I spend most evenings hiding booze from him hiding cards hiding keys He drinks until his head bobs around until he stumbles and breaks things and denies he s drunk I never should have gone to university I never should have left that shithole town I should have married the best farmer and shut my fucking mouth I hate my life I hate every day I wake up I hate myself for not doing it already I ve cut my arms open but never deep enough I hung myself but not privately enough I ve overdosed but barfed most of it up The only thing keeping me alive is knowing he won t take proper care of my dog,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

My Story I Don t Want to Be Here AnymoreHello my name is Calvin I m a year old kid and I think I m done for good this time As far as my backstory I don t know where to start I grew up well had good parents and being an only child I ended up being spoiled as fuck looking back I wish I wasn t as it played into some bad mindsets later down the road but never mind that as I grew up life never had many issues until the early teen years and onwards Since then was an absolute downwards spiral there started my porn addiction loss of friends lack of connection with everyone in my life lack of desire for anything on the flipside when age hit the drive struck to turn all of it around since that point I started working on quitting my bad habits and made progress I have reconnected with friends I have started working on music that makes me feel fulfilled more than ever Looking back on this year the most things have happened this year than any point in my life despite the pandemic What went wrong Ever since three days ago something happened it was like the energy got zapped out of me Not just mentally but physically aswell Usually when I hit a low point there s always some sort of big spark that arises that inspires me to get back up again That spark hasn t arrived I ve tried everything in my power to build the momentum again Better sleep eating healthier working out everything that used to revive me in the past nothing Nothing is working I genuinely feel like my soul does not have the power to get back up again this time for good At this point I m looking for a quick way to end it I ve lost all interest in my hobbies relationships and myself I am ready to be done with this,"['Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

Cold empty alone I m currently sitting in my room after a particularly horrible moment with my mother and don t know what else to do You probably already know what I want to do I don t even know why I m here Just turning to the one place I know Reddit Sorry for any mistakes my eyes are leaking I know no one cares about any type of backstory or even me but I guess I should give a bit more background to make myself seem a little less like the shitty teenager you ll think I am But first of all what sparked this particular fight if I can even call it that was I was just having a generally shitty day Felt nauseous all day for some reason my mother drove over a curb which caused the pizza we had just bought to spill onto my brand new white shirt plus my mom has just been rude all day to me to strangers It s just your typical annoying day I was annoyed and you could tell Wasn t really speaking much but when I did I was short with her and bitter This annoyed her and I knew that but I couldn t make myself cheery Right before our fight I was telling her about Juice WRLD and how sad it was I had already mentioned his passing earlier but I m a big fan of someone he had collaborated with didn t know they had collaborated until that moment and was explaining to her how they apparently collaborated During saying this she was nodding her head and acting like she was listening but apparently she wasn t She started coughing a few moments after I was finished speaking and said I was choking the entire time you were talking Thanks for noticing and caring Really means a lot Now if I had noticed she was choking I would ve immediately helped her I m not that horrible When speaking to her I was looking directly at her and she was nodding the entire time and didn t seem in distress whatsoever I was confused and told her this but she said she was making it obvious but couldn t tell me she was choking since she couldn t breathe and was coughing I pointed out she didn t cough until after I finished speaking but she just said I was wrong I let it go because I don t want to argue so I just go back to browsing Reddit She asked me now what did you say and I just told her to forget about it it didn t matter This is where everything went horribly She persisted come on tell me Now I ll admit I yelled at her Everything was boiling right under the surface and I just couldn t keep calm anymore She proceeds to tell me she heard me mention Juice WRLD and my favorite band but she didn t know why I told her then she must ve heard me This is when she decides to push my buttons She starts saying how I m just the happiest little girl she s ever met I m almost how I m a ray of sunshine and SUCH a good daughter and she s laughing this entire time I m ignoring her because she does this all the time looking for a reaction and I don t want to give her the satisfaction This is when she mentions how I need happy pills and she doesn t know what type of pills that would be but I need some kind of pill she didn t mean antidepressants This seemed incredibly insensitive to me as I was just speaking to her about Juice WRLD and of course so many people are thinking his death is caused from drug use She knew what she was doing I ll admit I said something really disgusting I said good maybe they ll kill me so I can finally die She s known about my suicidal thoughts since August of this year and didn t much care when she found out She actually found out because I had told my sister about some notes journal type things I had written to help me cope She confronted me like I was in trouble saying we need to talk and you know exactly what you ve done She didn t do anything except threaten me with making me go to a hospital and sent me to my room I ve brought it up one other time on Thanksgiving after a huge family fight saying May I had a handful of pills ready to go and didn t do it She made this about herself saying how she must be a terrible mother I just ignore it at this point After I said maybe the nonexistent happy pills she s speaking about would kill me she started going off She said I have no business acting like my life is so horrible how I have the easiest life in the world how other people my age have school jobs and even kids and how she doesn t make me do anything and hands me everything on a silver platter I ll get to why this really hurt me later But she just kept saying that I shouldn t act like she s the worst person in the world because she s the best mom I ve got she says this every single time me or my sibling is upset with her and I stayed silent the entire time I was crying but silent She knows why I struggle with living but doesn t care She dropped me off at our shared home and left She has actually came back home as I was writing this I m currently locked in a bathroom A big reason as to why I struggle with living is because of chronic illness For probably years I ve been sick I genuinely don t remember what it feels like to not feel pain It started with a rare condition which was causing me to vomit every day of my year old life and I started to lose my vision Took a year before they figured out what it was but i was on medication for a long time spinal taps every couple months before I finally had brain surgery in A few months after the surgery I had a fever every single day of August It took a while before they discovered what it was IBD Not many people without IBD know how much it sucks and I m sure my experience is unlike other people suffering with IBD but when I say my IBD has ruined my life I mean it I haven t been in remission once since fall I ve been close but there has always been something wrong My GI office that I stuck with from beginning to summer of this year also didn t help much as I found out I had been on medication I shouldn t have been steroids for years which has also made my life a living hell I have since been diagnosed with cushing s syndrome because of the steroid use I also have fibromyalgia osteopenia and gastroparesis Things were bad May since I had that handful of pills but that summer I was started on chemotherapy and it genuinely ruined my life I don t know if my reaction was normal but after a couple doses my days started blending together It s hard to describe but it felt like my average day was maybe an hour or two long During this time I felt absolutely zero emotion I felt nothing I just remember wishing I could feel again Crying and being upset hurts but being physically unable to feel nothing being completely and utterly numb is so much worse I really could not feel And I thought it would get better after I was off of it but I didn t for a long time I was so numb and so scared I m still not back to what I was before The only way I can describe how I feel is like I m in this super deep dark hole I m completely alone it s freezing cold and all my senses have been ripped from me All I feel is so scared I m always scared I have nightmares every single night about my worst fears and I have flashbacks about different procedures Sometimes I ll be sitting doing nothing and feel like a feeding tube is being forced down my nose I know it s not really happening but I get so scared A lot of traumatic things have happened to me and my doctors and mom make me feel like I m being a baby about it I ve never sought help for any of these mental issues because I know I won t be happy or okay til I m normal Not sick Not in pain For my mom to tell me I have the easiest life in the world really hurts I am in misery I keep trying to claw myself out of where I m at and recently I ve been happy Or I thought I was But last night I felt a little strange and then today this all happens and I realize I was never happy i was just trying to pretend I was I m exhausted I m tired I m having a hard time breathing and I just want it all to be over I don t want to be alive but I can t make myself kill myself I m a coward I pray every night that I won t wake up the next day so when I roll over and see the sun through my blinds see the posters on my walls and feel that I m still here I m upset The one thing I want won t happen unless I do it myself And I can t bring myself to do it no matter how hard I try What makes it so much worse is my grandmother dad s side called me while I was writing this She brought up how our entire family has been depressed and how she felt like she was in a fog She told me this while I m ranting about wanting to die How cruel is that Even worse my grandfather wanted to talk to me He is the only father figure I ve ever known the only man I ve ever trusted and loved and my light and purpose He is the only person to ever fully love me His love is unfaltering and he s always been here for me I had to give short responses because I was sobbing but I m really good at hiding it now so I don t think he noticed And then he told me he loves me so much and to please take care of myself He told me he loved me again I broke I think he might ve heard me but I don t know I needed that so badly but the worst part is it isn t changing my mind I still want to die How can I be so cruel and selfish That s

I want to die honorableI don t know if this is suicidal but I want to die in a way that I myself find glorious While I know I would never harm myself willingly I yet desire to cease existing But as the good nature in me calls for doing something good and helping others I want to die in a battle I would like to join some militia or organization that fights terror groups or generally saves other people so I could at least do something good for other people one last time before I leave And in case I don t die from that then great But I doubt it because I am not good I have never been to the military because my health problems are too much of a burden And where I live almost every male goes to the military at adult age So I also feel like I am missing out on something important even though I don t regret having to go there But yet perhaps that would make it up for this I mean someone without experience like me will die fast anyway right So doing something good and something I feel proud of while leaving with honorable actions is just the perfect setup Because else I am just a burden and non loved by anyone I cannot love myself because I can only do that if others love me as well I am the kind of person that depends on others I have to push myself and if I can t go on I just feel horrible For years I have tried following my dreams actually doing my best to achieve things in life but all failed Sure I tried and did my best there is nothing more I can do But this is exactly what bothers me If my best isn t enough to continue what else can I do You don t wanna see me try my worst if my best is already that horrible And I had enough always having to fight for things I never get in the end while others get it laid out on their hands Be it job and career or love life Sure I have friends and family I have a roof over my head and food on the plate But life is more than just surviving especially in these times where society expects much more of someone I often say I just wanna die but when I say I wanna die I really just mean I wanna finally start living and not just surviving like right now But the more days pass the more I think perhaps it actually is for the better if I do die Today it pushed me on the edge I had to hold a blade to my throat and chest for the first time in many many years To think I really be pushed that hard But I don t know why for some reason I still do have hope I kinda always have hope for something I cannot explain this phenomenon Even if I think I plan to die in battle I yet have hope to leave it alive and gaining new experience and mindset that could change me positively Even in such negativity I find positivity But this all is a double edged sword the one side that has hope that something good could happen but the other side that is right now a bit sharper than the other the side that just wants me to die Does anyone else feel like this Can you understand this And yes I am already trying to get help but I will not know the outcome in the end of all this,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Yesterday I was talked out of suicide by my ex boyfriend I don t really know what to say here I just feel like I need to get all this off of my chest For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone even when I was in a really great place in life Recently the past few months things have gotten worse for me Multiple factors are piling up and it s starting to feel like it s entirely too much to handle This past weekend I stayed at my ex s house and tonight when I got home something just changed got worse somehow and I just wanted to end it I was actually going to do it For some reason though I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed he has school today he wants me to get help but I can t afford to get any He told me that he might turn me in which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I ve been thinking of I told him I d never forgive him and I can t handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone but deep down I would give anything to have some help I ve told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he s just now starting to believe me He told me he will get me help no matter what but I m so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I ve been thinking of doing I can t even talk to anyone face to face about it I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face I m not sure if I have social anxiety the talking to people being around people part depression both or neither but I m sure that I m sick of my life being this way I m sick of existing and not living I found this subreddit through MMFB which I found through IAMA and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown I don t know if you ve read this far but if you have thank you If you care for me to I can try to keep this updated Also in case someone was wondering why I don t go to another friend for help instead of my ex it s because my ex is literally the only friend I have I had a clique that we both hung out with but I stupidly pushed them away,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I m too stupid to achieve anything in life I m thinking of taking my life tomorrow night I have a low IQ Twice I ve been tested and both times I got an IQ around Somehow I didn t do entirely awful in school I was able to be a B student without much studying When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the s and even some at Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades I barely retained any of what I learned Nobody around me believes that I am stupid because of my grades but that is all they go off of I have a poor vocabulary overall especially in spoken word and I cannot do basic mental math I still count with my fingers and I am nineteen years old I am from a low income uneducated family so I was innately disadvantaged from birth also with having my mom smoke weed and cigarettes throughout her pregnancy with me During the th month of her pregnancy I detached from the placenta and they had to preform an emergency c section It is very likely that I have brain damage from oxygen deprivation I just feel incredibly empty every moment I am awake My favorite time of the day is when I go to sleep at night but night always goes by too quickly Lately I ve been spending everyday sleeping because I have much more joy in my dreams I just want at least an average intelligence at least It is unbearable being aware every moment that I am dumb and will only ever be dumb I have always aspired to leave the financial hole but everyday that passes reminds me that it will probably never happen At this point I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place because I am terrified to leave behind my family and my pets but I know if I continue living my life will only get worse and worse Please if anyone could give me even just a smidgen of hope I will be greatly appreciative,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Dark Realizations Planning for the futureFor a long time I have been teetering on the living vs dying debate Obviously I want to live but at some point it stops being worth enduring existing Responsibilities offset this and delay death but when those responsibilities expire I don t see the point of living any longer Yes there are experiences I have yet to have Yes I could have happy days or even contentment but at what cost I don t want to go through life in a medicated stupor in attempt to offset the remnants of an evolutionary advantage I m not interested in self medicating either If I live I want to live in sobriety and awareness I don t see much point in existing unless I m living for the benefit of others Martyrdom seems like a silly reason to go on existing There is always the selfishness argument but at some point there must be a threshold where you ve done enough and clocked in enough time I am definitely not at that point yet but I will be and I know it So when that time comes what reasons do I have to live I can look back on my life and see happiness and regrets I can think about what will become of my survived loved ones and create narratives where they suffer and grieve but that grief won t be about me It will be their own regrets They ll wonder what they could have done differently and what could have pushed me to that point all the while knowing and understanding my struggle They ll regret being self absorbed like we all are and wish they could have done things differently but they can t and neither can I Some may carry it longer than others and I ll do my best to write heartfelt notes of absolution so that they understand that I finally crossed the threshold and that it isn t their fault I ve had practice at that I ve written them on separate occasions but someone s need always overrode my need to die I wish I would have died years ago I m already late I ve already lived too much and too long and brought even more suffering upon myself and those around me Yes there has been happiness I m not denying that but there isn t enough and I have no means to facilitate more happiness in my life I am and have been emotionally destitute for quite some time and I m tired of it The joy I have in my life is illusory and deluded I create narratives where things are different I immerse myself in these narratives to convince myself that I am needed and that the world is better off with me here It isn t So what do I do How do I stop this I am not in any imminent danger but I have a strong sense that it will happen I don t have any dreams left and I want nothing from the future I am not looking forward to anything and every activity of my life is simply passing time until the inevitable end I do not dread this end but I feel the need to test this accepted reality against the harshest of critics Thanks for reading,"['Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking']",medium

Correctable mistakes snowballed into something horrible I end up paying for mistakes I ve made or risks I ve taken in my life ten times over I might also seriously have the worst luck ever I ve looked into ending my life but it says in the sidebar we re not allowed to discuss methods so I ll leave it at that It s almost like I m just a normal person trapped in a very very abnormal life By the time I realized what was going on way too much time had passed So I ve started to formulate my exit plan I hope no one will judge me here My father is something I can t even say on here because I m too embarrassed to even say it You can use your imagination though I was severely neglected by mother she didn t even teach me how to read make a bed drive a car ride a bike my dad provided the bare basics and I learned everything else by trial and error or other people s parents As a child she would throw my shoes out the window No one but my dad knew no one would even think to ask about something so bizarre right She was really unstable and would have very public screaming fits on vacations I ve literally never seen anyone act as crazy as her not even the mentally ill homeless people you might run into like she would be on a small rowboat screaming that she wants to die on a lake for thousands of people to hear She s apparently been in this conditon since she was in elementary school but no one got her any help My mother would try to get into car accidents while I was in her car and I don t really feel safe in cars unless I m the one driving anymore She would sneak up behind me while I showered or hide in closets pretend to mishear me when I spoke and instigate hours long screaming fights like clockwork every time I went out with friends While I lived with her she would leave raw meat out on the counter over night maybe in the hopes I might get sick My mother s thought process is actually even scarier than the behavior that I ve briefly described When I have a migraine she will withhold medication for hours If I cough once she ll keep asking me if I m okay If I have a fever she d tell me I m lazy When I m healthy she screams in my face daily that I turned out poorly because she spoiled me too much even though I was so conscious of money that I wore kid s jackets in college to save money lived in a bedroom apartment with roommates have never been on vacation with her since I was even though she goes on vacation twice a year I know it sounds trivial but she literally can t go a day without putting someone down about what college they went to It s actually crazy though it s not snobbery it s like some really weird scary obsession unlike anything I ve ever seen She only sees people through this one label it s like they are not even humans at all She never listened to music read or did much of anything It s compensatory narcissism taken to the next level The only emotions I ve ever seen her express are rage and sadness and a weird flatness She sees people as superheros or peasants For a while she became obsessed with the idea that I wasn t allowed to do more than survive So I had to convince her human beings are meant to do more than survive This barely scratches the surface of my experiences I honestly should not have been born My life is such a nightmare I m not even human in the normal sense of the word My dad is also mentally ill vindictive and violent They are way more than mentally ill and abusive though They re incredibly similar to the weird neighbors in the movie American Beauty but within the disorienting gritty world of American Horror Story Honestly when that series came out I wondered if Ryan Murphy had been stalking me all these years I was a victim of severe gaslighting sexual physical emotional and verbal abuse What makes it such a trap is that they are basically outcasts so everything is totally weird the way they talk they never joke my dad knows like a total of a words they just don t have the social skills even the average person might have even our house was weird the cars they drove were weird But since they were in such reactive denial about it I could never fully come to terms with the truth So I was so brainwashed my own eyes would deceive me You might wonder how in the world I could stay in a situation like that right I think I m pretty submissive by nature and my parents hammered it into me I wasn t allowed want the stable lifestyle my friends had my life has literally been a prison where I took it for granted that I belonged in a completely different world than everyone else and that led me down a really dark path for absolutely no reason I did try to go college at first I had a dissociative disorder my whole life and my mother constantly sabotaged my college education so I could never get away successfully She manipulated me into applying to lower tier schools than I initially qualified for I still trusted her at that point I was so used to being gaslighted that I couldn t even think they were abusive until I had suffered another years with PTSD while trying to have a normal college experience having to put up with weekly screaming matches where I d be told I would never get a job and be exploited whenever I needed any money I had to move in with my mother to save money and escape but she was aware of my intentions and embarked on this terrifying extinction burst She contacted her doctor and tried to get me medicated self diagnosed me with mental illnesses and tried to get her employees to ambush me catch me off guard in the most vulnerable time of my life thousands of miles away from my support network and emotionally abuse me and completely erase my past They told me I had always been a difficult child that I had grown up a loner with no friends and that I needed anger management I was incredibly disoriented and felt like my whole life was being stolen from me I thought I was literally dead for a full year So I had a total breakdown had to try to heal in the midst of this twisted malicious intervention engineered by my mother who is actually the one who has always needed help since she was a child and I ve finally come out of that only to realize that I ve been screwed I don t know what to do My life isn t worth living I wasted so much time I planned on spending healing in order to fight this ridiculous war I totally should have seen coming but I honestly never thought she would take it this far and I m completely worn out I realize now I shouldn t have let it get to me but at the time I wasn t aware of triggers CPTSD narcissism and the way abuse works I was really naive and thought that everything was going to work out that my mother would get help and I might have the family I always wanted I don t need anyone anymore but nothing makes me happy I have no future I should have spent a lifetime focusing on myself instead of my mother She would literally try to interrupt me from studying establishing a social life improving my appearance being liked by other people and somehow find a way to make me feel crushing guilt about this on a minute by minute day by day year by year basis I think there is nothing left in me that can possibly try anymore I ve been crushed too many times and this last disaster with her has really destabilized my life I m so behind and isolated I don t think the people I used to know would even recognize what my life has become,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood

Just want to share these past couple days with you allEarly hours Thursday morning my nana attempted suicide She ODed on a mixture of prescription drugs and paracetamol My aunt checked on her a few hours later found her collapsed beside her bed she had been sick and was unconscious Eye bleeding from where she knocked her head on her beside table She had rosary beads and my grandads pocket watch in her hand Two ambulances arrived and took her away There was a carrier bag of empty medicine packets A bit of background My Nan has attempted this before she myself and many other members of my family have suffered varying levels of depression at different times for different reasons My Nan turns this year She was witty active creative and thoughtful She was diagnosed with terminal fibrosis of the lungs months ago and her quality of life declined rapidly more than we had realised The paramedics on a rd attempt managed to revive her and she was put into Critical Intensive Care Since then I ve witnessed the raw shock and emotion from my family members When only weeks ago I had considered suicide again I related to her so much but from a totally different perspective Her chances of survival were next to none primarily because her lungs were too weak but there was also brain damage from the minutes she was unresponsive in the ambulance I don t know why I m writing this out I don t exactly have a point but it s pushed me away from suicide for now I understand Nan truly I do She is still in hospital her lungs expected to give out some time tonight For the brief time she was conscious and able to get some words out to us she apologised As incredible the technology and the teams are that brought my Nan back for a brief amount of time I really believe that if somebody is mentally capable of choosing to end their life especially when faced with a terminal illness we should let them go I would ve done the same There s much more I can talk about more of my nans last words all the differing views of my family some want to cover up the fact there was a suicide attempt but that just adds to the stigma This discussion is necessary Whatever I m tired Self harming still but suicide has been pushed back for another time,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13, it was from a school councillor. Later things were being a lil simple but then I lost my best friend. So it’s weird, she left me and my coping mechanism was to assume that she died. I feel it’s real. I’ve severe anxiety, like all physical symptoms. I’ve them all, just that I don’t sweat. Anxiety attacks, panic attacks are a normal part of my life since past two years.
 I’ve lost so many people now that I’m not weak but broken now. All were family (no breakup).
 I’m afraid I’ve BPD, I’ve all 8/9 symptoms. I don’t wanna self diagnos but I feel it’s real.
 I feel everything just so intense that can’t even discribe.
 Sometimes I feel I’m making mental illness, I’m fake is all I feel when no symptoms around.
 I’ve chest pain almost all day in breaks, sometimes mild, sometimes strong. It’s just so pathetic. I feel as a complete fake and unknown person. Can’t recognise what are my choices and who am I?
 Can someone tell me do I’ve BPD or am I faking?
 Anxiety and Depression are real but sometimes I think that’s also fake.
 Can’t go for professional help as I’m 17 rn and there are things so, I’ll go for professional help when I’ll be 18 and get a college admission.
 Please helps people.
 I’ve told about ya symptoms to many people but half them mocked me and made fun and others just showed sympathy which I hated. I feel also, just so alone.
 Also I get scary closed eye hallucinations 50% of the day and it’s so triggering for me. Who am I? Why am I?

I want to give everything and expect nothing in returnI ve been battling depression my whole life I m years old now and I feel like Atlas holding up the world on my shoulders and my shoulders are finally buckling I recently broke up with my gf the first one in my life after about a month of dating Told her I loved her she said she never wanted a family or to get married or settle down anywhere We agreed to remain friends but stuff happened and she was forced to cut me out of her life Got back in touch with her again and she still wanted to be friends and she even told me she loved me the other day as a friend but her actions say otherwise I ve given a lot of support to her and all I get in return is I need space for a while She does have problems of her own which I understand but what she s doing I ve never had someone who claimed they loved me do these things to me I feel totally alone I ve lost someone who actually understood me I don t want to bother my other friends push my problems on them The more I think about it the more I want to give up I feel unattractive even though I try to take care of myself I feel so horribly broken shattered into a million pieces that can t be glued back together again I feel so unbelievably lonely which is my greatest fear in life I m also a giver to a fault I always try to give my all to others to make sure they re happy over myself I wanted to become a police officer to help people I was thinking about becoming a living donor for Christmas giving part of my liver and some bone marrow to someone else in greater need but it s so much easier to just give everything The more I think about it the more noble it sounds in my head end my life so dozens of others can live out theirs with a new heart new kidney new liver I always wanted to save someone s life and I feel like the last two weeks have been leading to this I feel like I m at the end of my rope now like there s no more time left Like my life has been leading to this moment I don t want to do this but I don t think it s possible to live happily anymore I think that time has come and gone I really don t want to do this to my mom either since we re super close but I feel like all my options have gone out the window and I m closing in on this I m seeing a therapist too but I know if I say anything to her she ll call someone they ll take me away and then I ll never be able to become a cop if I m able to work through this I don t know when I m gonna do it but I think this is the closest I ve ever been to ending it all,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

It s my birthday in two weeksMobile Throwaway Longer than originally intended and while reading it back realised it sounds like a shit r storytime post so sorry for that I ve pretty much always felt sad for as long as I can remember Not all the time but if there were no distractions my default mood was sad Not necessarily crying my eyes out just low drained unmotivated to do anything I didn t tell anyone about how I felt because that was just normal to me Besides loads of people in their late teens early s say how depressed they are what s so special about me feeling down I worked in a pub for a year starting when I was As an antisocial introvert who finds his energy being away from people this was not a pleasant experience My girlfriend at the time was away at uni meaning between her lectures and my unsociable working hours we never got to see each other The weekend before my th birthday I worked clopens close the night open the morning in a row As I lay in bed after the final shift I felt so empty and alone and sad I accepted that this probably wasn t normal and that things needed to change I couldn t go on feeling sad all the time so I set myself an ultimatum By the time I turned I would be happy or I would be dead This seemed to relieve some of the pressure it gave me something to work towards as well as a finish line I knew it wouldn t go on forever Fast forward about and a half years I was still living at my parents house but I d left the pub and had a couple jobs in between At the time I was involved in stock management for a large national corporation which is to say I worked nights stacking shelves at a supermarket This was not my ambition I didn t really have an ambition but this wasn t it nor did I want to spend more time there than I really needed to so I was looking for other work as well I had applied for a particular job that seemed perfect for me flexible hours short commute ability to work from home if needed fast typing necessary v me on typeracer and find out all in all it felt like a good fit One day after a particularly unpleasant shift the night before I woke up to an email thanking me for my interest but that I was not going to be offered the job Not even an interview I didn t get the chance to show how well I would be able to work in the right environment All the factors that had made me so hopeful that I could get a proper job and do something that would bring me joy while earning a living at the same time gone discarded without a second look It wasn t fair But I didn t have the mental strength to deal with it there and then so I decided not to bother I went to get some dinner breakfast and was greeted by my mother usually very lovely asking all the wrong questions about money jobs my attitude just a lot of stuff that she has every right to be concerned about while I was living with my parents but absolutely the wrong time to ask I snapped at her we both said things we wish we hadn t I left and drove to a place where I could be alone and calm down After a while I went back home my parents were both very apologetic about the situation and I apologised as well I explained what had happened how I was feeling ALL of it and asked if they would help me get help I went to a GP and was diagnosed with clinical depression started on sertraline because who needs a sense of humour or sex drive to be happy Not only this but due to the length of the NHS waiting list my parents paid for me to see a private counsellor Therapy helped me talk and work through some things I d been struggling with for a while and was generally very beneficial I was able to realise that most of what was holding me back came from myself I didn t try new things or meet new people because I was worried that I wouldn t be good enough At least by not trying I d never know for certain maintaining the illusion of adequacy I so desperately needed These realisations came at a time where I ended a pretty nasty relationship came back from a session feeling very emotionally raw and was told the only way to feel better was to get a real job and to move in with her immediately and had secured an interview for a lucrative position with a clear path for progress Not only this but shortly afterwards I met someone else who is funny beautiful understanding and generally very lovely Life was good The antidepressants were stopped over the summer months and I made the decision to not carry on with them afterwards I moved out of my parents house and got a place with my new girlfriend And I got the job I had achieved everything I d wanted building a solid foundation from which the rest of my life could flourish But even now when all the distractions are put away and the world outside the window goes quiet I m still sad I lie less than a foot away from my loving girlfriend yet I m still alone I m years old and I m not happy It s my birthday in two weeks,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive

I am just tired of being here and the people on this world. My friend got killed over a fight before he could even finish high school. I have seen a dude with part of his brain and head blown out. I myself have been shot and left for dead over a phone. My family uses me as a scape goat. Everything that goes wrong they yell at me. I cannot go one day without being yelled at made to feel like I am worthless and a mistake. I try reaching out to people but they do not seem to care. As soon as I mention I want to talk about something serious they stop replying. At this point I am just done. I have lost hope. I just cut myself and watching the blood run down my arm was the closest thing to relief I have had. I just want to cut my arm from wrist to end of my arm and just bleed out. The pain feels amazing compared to the mental pain and losing blood feels so good. I think I am ready to go. I have experienced life and it has been nothing but pain and being used.

"Is it overcompensating because you feel unworthy, so you need to give others an added value, because you aren't one ?
 Is it you picking narcissistic people so that they feed of you, since it's familiar?
 Is it out of kindness and empathy?
 Is it out of guilt?
 Were you trying to save yourself through them?
 Why the self sacrifice?
 Why doing so and not being at all happy about it, even angry at yourself?
 Why those people disappear once you stuck on their side when they were in distress? Or was it you pushing them away, because you feel that now that you aren't needed you will be discarded? Or them changing their attitude? Are you the jerk at the end ? Or is it them ?
 And why does it feel good, so good when you weren't the one that messed it up, after asking most of the people you know, if you did? And why can't you get over it, ever, when you did?
 
 I've never had a ""sure"" answer for those questions, I don't trust my judgement, and maybe I'm just victimising myself, or maybe I'm not.
 
 Had been dealing with those interactions most of my life, I wanna break the cycle.

I keep trying and nothing changes Warning Long Post I m going to describe my situation I m and will be this March I did a year of college and withdrew because I realized if I went to a city or state funded school it would be far cheaper and just as good an education than the college I was at But at the same time I realized I wanted to move out of New York Either way over in interest accruing debt from that measly two semesters of college I urgently needed a job of course to pay rent in the mean time I lived in Brooklyn for a year in two awful living situations with crazy roommates I couldn t move back home because my brother has severe violent anger issues and has used racial slurs including the n word in the past and my mother is a horrible alcoholic That was years ago in Since then I have gone through more applications trial runs and interviews than I can count With no degree and no specific skill or experience I have applied to mostly stores and some restaurants in that time I ended up moving back home with my mother and now she pays rent for my brother s apartment in a town over Not because of me because she kicked him out The longest job I had was as a cashier at a Stop amp Shop for months I worked full time hours most weeks more than hours a week but they thinly skirted the system so as not to give me healthcare I ended up quitting because they gave me hell about using the bathroom Seriously the people who were supposed to cover me would refuse to let me use the bathroom and would call me on the loudspeaker when I had only been in there a couple minutes It got so bad that I could never relax enough to pee Damnably I still have the problem to this day I ve tried everything I quit the job in April almost a year ago and well before that the urination problem started Frequent urination I m positive it s from the job I have never struggled with this before in my life It doesn t feel right anymore if I am exercising I have to go at least every minutes so I don t exercise anymore The doctor told me it s psychological and told me to see a therapist More on that later I was denied unemployed benefits blamed by them Can t get food stamps because I don t meet eligibility since I don t pay or more of of my expenses Yes my mom and her father pay rent but she does not give me any money She used to and then stopped entirely I can only survive with the food pantry in my town Since then I ve applied to so many jobs I ve lost the people I used to talk to because they started blaming me saying I wasn t doing enough and it was my fault too No friends I m a virgin which I don t care about I don t compare myself to people and I hate the predominant culture that assigns value to such things anyway always have I m so poor that dating and relationships are impossibly distant anyway I don t talk to my mother anymore at all She is an alcoholic that neglected and abused me and my brother our entire lives and feels zero remorse and blames and vilifies me for every little thing every chance she gets Her father physically assaulted my brother and flat out told me the one time I tried to reach out to him that he doesn t want to see me or ever deal with my problems Needless to say he drinks and verbally abusive to his wife too He took my mother s side when I left home at one point because of how bad my mother was house hopping with friends I no longer have before I went to college My mother is a compulsive hoarder and the entire apartment is a mess so I ve never had guests over and it s hard to cook food I m vegetarian so all I eat is oats cereal spaghetti and occasionally frozen vegetables But even that is hard because the kitchen is such a mess and if I tried to clean it she would scream at me for throwing something away or make it messy again and blame the mess on me My father is out of the picture the last time he emailed me he blamed me for leaving college and doing nothing He has a new wife and daughter and lives in Japan Needless to say I don t think he deserves to know how hard I ve been trying against the grain of everything I don t drink smoke or do any drugs of any kind Never have never will Never had the slightest interest in it This makes me even more isolated almost everybody at least in New York City does I d rather be alone than be friends with any of them no question The only way I could theoretically have a life again is if I find a job save up earn money to move out I knew it would be hard but I don t mind working at least hours a week standing all day focusing on the job waking up early and coming home every day when it s dark I m used to it I have a great work ethic and am polite to everyone Just recently I lost two jobs at a pharmacy and waffle shop in my town Why They just Didn t Like me They refused to give me an explanation I kept myself busy the entire time took notes was diligent and polite to everyone And nothing Just now my mother threatened to evict me Unlike my brother who was drinking and fighting with her I keep to myself She threatened to kick me out because the neighbors in the apartment make up lies about noise I know the noise is not coming from me because I am always quiet but she believes them Wants me gone Has talked about air bnb ing my room She never loved or wanted me and only sees me as a problem and a burden and would prefer me dead More money and space for her I try not to think about how horrible she is because the opposite of love isn t hate it s indifference I need to just focus on my own life finding a job to be my own independent person and focus on things that matter to me As I told her before she is not my mother So I feel nothing but once in a while in push come to shove situations like this I have a nervous breakdown So one time the police came because a neighbor called them because I couldn t stop screaming and crying But that had nothing to do with the noise complaints this was recently and after them I m positive I don t want kids I got a vasectomy from Planned Parenthood They gave me weird energy and so did the doctor I saw later about the urination Your average person thinks you ll regret it or you just got it because of the way YOUR parents were In reality I am not bringing a son or daughter into this world that has to deal with the problems of this world They would have to deal with all of the political social and climate resource related problems in the world They wold have to deal with heartbreak loss work suffering have the possibility of an accident or unbelievable agony from illness know they will die And at the end of course die I can t look into the eyes of my beloved child knowing they will die I don t not believe in God or the afterlife I KNOW that God or the afterlife doesn t exist Biologically people are dead and dead for good There are enough people that know they are alive and know they will die Theoretically I could be just as happy without kids and a family I have no idea how with all of this but I volunteer every Friday in Brooklyn taking a commute that is over hours both ways It s not really surprising it s my only connection to the outside world because I have no friends here in the suburb I grew up in and am stuck living in now I m not close friends with any of the people there though and it s led to nothing I never tell them about all of this and occasionally if someone asks how I am and I say anything less than great they would think I don t appreciate what I have since I don t pay rent Some of them like me but it s nothing if I can t get a job to move on with my life which I can t Every day is unbearable Theoretically I am a like able person but none of it in practice matters After all is said and done the final question is why do I not see a therapist Why not talk about this to them instead of this website One word medication I had a bad experience with one that I had since middle school who got so fascist about it he would refuse to talk to me unless I took it Which I did one mg pill of Prozac In case you didn t know that s the smallest possible dose of a mild antidepressant that takes weeks to kick in or taper down from You can laugh at this I took one pill and my balls started to hurt My body literally rebelled against it That was how much I was badgered into doing something I didn t want to do He wasn t a psychiatrist but he was connected to the one I saw who prescribed the Prozac So I quit both of them This was soon after I left college in I know most psychologists therapists would be the same way Blame me Something is wrong with me I don t know a lot but I know they are wrong I know how intelligent polite self motivated I am Every problem I have ever had has been reacting to external circumstance and with that a lot of patience and fortitude If I had money everything could be different I would have time space a place of my own and would live alone I would still work but using my gifts for the world Or even a drudgery job I wouldn t care But as it is my life has been my mother and brother their constant threats and abuse stuck in it with every effort to proceed with my life rebuffed and actively painful thrown back in my face When I lived in an apartment I could only afford one with roommates who were also psychotic My own ticket to salvation a job I have been trying to find one and failing for years with countless problems and crazy people at them I have been so patient with but even there I leak out the side sometimes They would say I have anxiety emotional problems ADHD trouble focusing and need medication And that if I don t take it I m immature blaming other people instead of taking responsibility I could not possibly be more mature or responsible If I wasn t these things this entire post would be hate for my parents for not giving me money But what is it It s focusing on the fact that I can t get jobs or even at least unemployment benefits so I can eat and survive while I look for one But I accept that because I can t change it and even then focus on getting jobs And I know that medication is not the answer At the end of the day I am finding myself lacking the willpower I still try to apply to jobs but every day strangles me more than the last The very motivation is stifled because everything of my body and mind has learned that all of my efforts boomerang back in my face It s so hard to try when the job people yell at me and blame me and think false things of me no different than my mother It s terrible that it has come to this but more and more lately I think how suicide would be a sweet escape No more pain or suffering This can t be denied The only reason not to do it is that there s a possibility of things getting better and being happy in the future I know I can never be happy living with my mom that s for sure So I ve held on all this time on the possibility that I might get a job and move out I see a lot of posts here saying things like Everyone says it will get better and It won t get better Slowly I am waking up to the fact that these things are no less true for me Of course part me wants to live But as I realize further and further the impossibility of getting that chance at least not having to suffer anymore slowly becomes more and more enticing The one post I won t tolerate is saying go to college in New York now I hate New York and everything about it and am positive I want to move Do not say there is no heaven or wherever you go there you are or anything of the sort I am not in the slightest idealistic and I know everywhere has problems no less than I know that the only possibility of me being happy is moving If it took more than years to save up enough to move while living here I would accept that if I knew that once I moved out I would never have to live with my mom again but at the same time I would rather die than live here for another years in this condition while also being busy in college and having zero to show for it except less money and more debt This goes for years community college also Or living in the city which I also hate and I know there are no perfect cities no less than I know there are cities substantially different than New York City And I am never living in a dorm situation again From experience at two different colleges I know it s a nightmare with zero independence or privacy I want to get a job save up move to a city and go to a city funded college in the city whilst having a job to support myself I m positive I want to go to The West Coast or Europe I am realizing that it may be impossible and so the only other possibility is death You could say I could move to a place with a job with the degree but then I should be able to move with a job without that This world is evil There is a caste system that kills young people that have no skills by only letting them have kitchen or customer service jobs kicking them out of that blaming them denying their survival unemployment food stamps housing while they look for a job and the only way out is to take out a loan and being in debt for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars This is the most evil plutocratic thing ever The world is truly by and for the rich My friend who I no longer really talk to since he blames me for not having a job has EU citizenship through his mother and lives in France as a full citizen He is the luckiest person I know My mother was born in the USA but my father in Iran I sometimes think of getting Iranian citizenship since I wouldn t have to pay for college small potatoes compared to the work of learning Farsi Recently a thought has come to mind that describes my life I am asking for nothing and I can t even have that If I was asking for a house a car a job that paid enough to support a wife pets and two kids it would be different but I m not asking for any of that I just want to live alone have at least some time to pursue things like art that matter to me even if that always has to be on a shoestring budget and any mediocre job that is at least manageable if not difficult This has not been difficult it has been an impossible ideal No wonder I am depressed An unemployed no degree half Iranian year old NEET teetotalism virgin living in the USA the most murderous war machine in the world run by Donald Trump with a psychotic Nazi for a brother an absent father who thinks I m a loser and an alcoholic verbally abusive insane mother with zero friends an empty wallet and bank account rejected from every job every type of job every place over years because I am told I am incompetent anxious loser when in reality I am as hard working as they come I ll always know that the problem wasn t my negative thinking Everyone says change to more positive thoughts first if you want your life to change Nothing could inaccurately reflect my situation more than this I have had so much hope in all of my efforts for something to change or happen through those very efforts itself mind you not just waiting for things to change I ve gotten it out and even for this board it s a very long post No offence to anyone here but I see a lot of posts with a lot of missing capitalization punctuation grammar and spelling mistakes My grammar is anything but perfect or ideal but relatively speaking my writing is pretty polished if not only superficially as opposed to structurally I don t take pride in this but I hope if nothing else the effort to clearly articulate everything thus far shows If you ve gotten this far you must have a thing for reading the thoughts of depressed strangers on the internet Even if not one person reads it I at least typed all of it up And even if someone does at most they can just reply just cold words on the computer screen that might as well be my own In spite of everything I just said you can say whatever you want I would rather have people s sincere thoughts and feelings not be stifled from coming out After all nothing in the planet makes me angrier than the fact that the job people can t even tell me why they fire me A gun is put to my head and my last wish is to know why I have to die and they laugh as they pull the trigger It is one trillion times more damning and insulting that they hold back on account of my feelings or because they can t be bothered to tell me why they do not hire me than the fact that they reject me to begin with I ve never had a problem of cyber bullying because it s just words on the screen Say every awful thing if it s what you really honestly feel about me I ll appreciate the honesty even I assume people are reasonably nice here but the logic still applies At the end of the day I want what everyone wants to be happy But I ve given up on that I have tried for years which is one fifth of my lifespan If I cannot be happy at least I can not be unhappy For now I will keep trying on an empty tank of gas every day more emotionally stifling and painful than the last But like everything there is a limited capacity to this And unless suddenly my luck changes the capacity will eventually be reached And I do not believe in luck I only use it metaphorically as metaphorical as it would be to mention my situation improving Until then no thoughts well wishes feelings or prayers can help me Only tangible improvement which I know damn well can only be brought about by my own efforts which the blamers that is to say everyone I make the mistake of mentioning all of this to love to tell me more than anything I am making those efforts You know the results Medical problems more rejection violence more pain The tangible improvement will either come first or death by my own hands which I have had unfathomable patience already in holding off from But sooner or later the logic of it will become clear I don t want to die anymore than my biology wants to survive What will happen will happen but either way I dread the pain of the future,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"So this is my first Reddit post. Whatever that means, I’m just lost and really seeking help. I don’t want to end up like another BPD story where the love of their life walks out. 
 
 I lied to my partner Thursday, I believe I had a BPD episode and he doesn’t. Even if he doesn’t, it’s my fault, I’m no longer taking my meds or going to therapy. 
 
 On Thursday I made up a lie. About my partner’s ex whom he keeps in contact with (but we both keep in contact with our exs- nbd) I said a lot of crazy shit— I received a “text” message from someone who knows her and said they (his ex and him) would ultimately be together in the end, that he is using me, that he wants to be with her, and that he is deleting messages between them to because I have gone through his phone in the past, that I was crazy.
 
 I don’t know why I lied to that extreme, I just know that it was fucked up which is why I’m seeking accountability. 
 
 What does accountability look like for someone with BPD, I know I lied, I know I’m not on my meds I know I am not going to therapy. 
 
 When he confronted me about the lie on Friday I realized I had spilt it was all black and white thinking in my head. He loved and missed his ex and hated and wanted nothing todo with me. As I’m writing this I realize it isn’t the reality of things but I still acted out. And I need to be held accountable for my actions. I don’t want to lose the love of my life. 
 
 After he left the apartment to clear his head I began to cut because I needed to release all my emotions and built up anxiety. As I was looking at the blood fall I knew I had to seek help I didn’t want this to be the last feeling I felt. 
 
 I have my psychiatrist appointment the 19th at 10:30 am — wish me luck 🍀.

 I am not yet diagnosed with borderline but I’m almost 100% I have it. And it’s killing me. It has been killing me all my life. It has affected my friends, my loved ones and myself. But you probably already know that
 
 What’s concerning me right now, is whether or not I can feel love. Right now, my girlfriend and I are on a one week break from one another. I’ve been what I fee is an emotionally abusive asshole towards her. Paranoid that she would cheat on me, that she would leave me. And before that, ever little thing I didn’t like that she did, set me off. When it shouldn’t have, and I know it shouldn’t have. But it did anyways. And it always hurt me later to think about it.
 
 My question is: can borderlines feel love? I feel like I’ve been such a manipulative piece of crap to her, and I just want to know if there’s even any hope. I don’t want to hurt her heart, she means so much to me but I’ve been such a douche to her. I stared self reflecting so much, asking why I even love her. If I even do. I cried so much thinking about her gone. The thought of not seeing her. Her smile gone, her heart to someone else. She can do as she pleases but it hurts me. Do I love what she’s done for me, or her as a person? How can I even tell? Is she better off without me? Can I fix us? Maybe I’m overthinking..

"My (24f) girlfriend and I (27m) recently having been doing some research and talking about how she shows a number of signs of BPD. Thanks to Dr Keith Gaynor's brilliant lecture on BPD we're pretty sure it was her car accident a few years ago that was the traumatic stress trigger that caused her BPD to spiral and it's been very up and down ever since. As you all probably know having this condition, the lows and highs can occur from hour to hour and day to day, and she's in a pretty good spot today and hoping it lasts through the week. 
 
 What makes this most difficult for me is that I don't really know when she's flipped the switch to crisis mode. I can't live my life constantly on the look out for it right now, and any time i'm not fully prepared myself to deal with it, it spirals into a fight between us and that fight almost ruins a whole day for us. Stress about her current job situation means this could be a tumultuous week, and she's also in classes at night. 
 
 We've agreed that the only true solution is finding the right clinician and getting the help she needs, DBT seems promising! But at the end of the day, we're still really new learning about this condition, community, lifestyle whatever you want to call it. As someone who suffers with severe ADHD, from my own experience I felt like it actually got worse when I started learning about it more, it's like your brain can't help but exhibit the symptom you just learned your condition has a tendency to cause. Thankfully I'm in a place where I can support her with her work or class projects if she needs me to when she can't cope, and she's been returning the favor and helping me with my own scatter brain and forgetfulness. We're an amazing couple 80% of the time, and a hot mess 20%.
 
 She won't be able to get professional help at least for another month or so. And I'm truly worried about her and I want to do everything I can to help her navigate her life until then. This weekend was really really rough but tonight she seems to be getting to a better place, so please any tips or things to watch out for to help her not feel in the middle of a crisis every day! Would love to hear your thoughts or personal stories.","['Seeking Help', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update']",medium
am I the cause of my own demise Never posted on here before and I m not sure why I feel the urge to now I used to cut myself all the time in my head I did it for attention I wanted people to notice and ask me if I was okay so I could say that I wasn t and they safely tuck me away in a hospital for crazies and the doctors would spend months trying unsuccessfully to break through my emptiness The reality was that I was so scared of people seeing my cuts that I hid them the best I could despite having hundreds at any one time my family had no idea until I flipped out at school I was sitting in some stupid class I think we had a relief teacher it was a class where you could sit and talk with your friends and do nothing and the teacher wandered around doing sweet fuck all I don t know why but I grabbed a Stanley knife and sliced into my arm multiple times I remember it stinging so bad because there were so many lighter cuts underneath them I laughed I felt like I had something to prove A boy saw the blood and told the teacher she came over and I said he was lying but she wouldn t leave me alone so I pulled up my jumper sleeve and screamed at her to fuck off as I ran out I don t remember what happened next but my parents were told about it and I d left the school grounds The school councillor found me and for some reason I agreed to go with him to hospital He took me to be evaluated by a child shrink I barely said a word and I didn t look at him once I felt like I was in a trance the air around me felt so cold and heavy It was decided that I was perfectly sane and didn t need any sort of help what so ever The councillor took me home and my parents asked to see my cuts before never mentioning it ever again So anyway I continued to lead a destructive lifestyle most weekends were spent wiping myself out with a bottle of straight bourbon or vodka I hung out at local music gigs with my friends many of them much much older than myself I did things to the extreme because it made me popular not always in a good way I went out of my way to stand up for my behaviour so if someone in our extended friends circle thought I was a dick I d push and push until their close friends liked me and they d eventually give in and treat me nicely too Meanwhile I was a straight A student my parents worked a lot they didn t pay much attention to my schooling my grades weren t bad so they didn t give it a second thought In fact they saw me as being responsible I often babysat my little sisters one of them from when she was only a few months old I wouldn t abandon them or throw parties or anything but I did play horrible mind games with them and they d never tell because I d scared them into believing that was worse than whatever I d tricked them into thinking had happened was happening All of this stuff it was selfish I wanted to be the rebellious renegade cool kid but my parents and to a point my teachers were fed this bullshit goody two shoes image that they fell for This is how I got away with never doing my hometown handing in essays late wearing incorrect uniform everyday never doing exams never paying attention spending most of my time in the classroom yelling and laughing and making excuses Looking back I can honestly say that I am amazed at how much shit I got away with and that I finished school I found comfort in typing to a select few male friends for hours upon hours I often developed crushes on them but they never went much further than sex i was young and they were often in their early s One guy in particular sticks in my head not sexually or anything we never even went there back then in fact he broke his hand after punching a tree at his birthday party because he felt so bad that I was so attached to him at the time So that was my first real broken heart our friendship was awkward for a while and then I moved away and we have barely spoke since As a teenager I threw massive tantrums but I didnt realise the extent of them until the last few years when I discovered that I have black outs where I am in an uncontrollable rage I remember my parents holding me down at to check for track marks on my arms I must have been pretty psychotic for them to accuse me of being a junkie Teen angst I assumed but years on my episodes have only gotten worse This is already a stupidly long story I don t even tell this to my shrink so I ll summarise the rest quickly my family moved several hours away when I was in my second last year of school I hated my new school I felt so stupid and lost and uncomfortable I got pregnant had a secret abortion and never forgave myself I moved back and lived in a granny flat with one of my sisters Finished school but things just went ever the same I d discovered drugs Pills and speed My school friends didn t understand I moved back to the city near my parents The guy I got pregnant to had hung around and I was living with him until I realised I had only stayed with him because I was a mess after the baby thing he got abusive when I left him not wanting my parents to judge me or seem weak I kept living with my ex filing in my weekends with raves and a rebound guy One thing that did impact my life at this point was ghb considered a dirty scum drug I had a big crazy image to build to ensure I was popular in this new scene it was easy I had nothing to live for I hated myself for what I d done and the more I partied the less I had to stop and deal with the consequences I ended up in an ambulance times in weeks I passed out and woke up in some random guys bed with him fucking me I ran away and went back to the club I met a guy that loved going out too but knew I needed help so he wouldn t let me out of the house no matter how much I kicked and screamed We went out for a year but we were bad for each other we substituted ghb with speed and were still taking ghb when we could I spent destructive months after he left me in pieces My friends saw the tantrums one night male friends tried to stop me from hurting myself but I am stupidly strong in these rages and I managed to smash my head into the concrete several times until they let me go and then I ran and ran and don t remember the rest Ghb was ruining me again I met a guy from the rave scene I didn t think I was ready to leave my ex in the past but I decided to give it a chance So glad I did best thing that ever happened to me We moved in together after only a few weeks and years on were engaged I don t want to disclose the finger details in this time but I will say that whilst I m a better person we still give in to temptations just as often and I still have anger issues but until recently I hadn t wanted to hurt myself like I do right now My sister died a short time ago Overdose But on opiates It s not real to me it confuses me I can t make sense of it I don t want to deal with it I was diagnosed with ADHD anxiety disorders including mild OCD about a year ago Since my sister died my OCD is my way of coping things that used to be funny but necessary to me now physically hurt if I don t do them or if I do them wrong I can t help but think that my childhood desire to have people feel sorry for me paved the way to becoming that person Sometimes I wonder if it s just all in my head if I don t completely believe that I m sick how will I ever help myself When I get angry I often black out my partner tells me what happened each time I ve tried to jump out of his car at high speeds on a freeway drank bleach tried to grab a gun off a police officer hit my head so many times it s not funny taken pills blah blah right now it all seems like a good idea I feel so selfish It makes me feel worse,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress

"I just found out I’m pregnant. I’ve been “casually dating” this guy for only a couple months now. He’s not even technically my boyfriend. But he sure as hell is my FP. I’m not on birth control and participated in some risky sexual behavior… and well, here we are. 
 
 After a few days of thinking about it, I know I’m not going to have an abortion and I’m going to have this baby. I haven’t told him yet and I’m terrified how he’s going to react. 
 
 This entire situation is super tricky because of the BPD and the favorite person aspect. I don’t even think I’m capable of being a good mom with this disorder. 
 
 I also take 3 medications - all of which have huge warnings against taking during pregnancy. So I just went off them cold turkey. 
 
 I really need advice and support. Especially what to do if he reacts poorly. I can’t handle the idea of being abandoned by him and then having his baby.","['Cause of Distress', 'Critical Risk', 'Seeking Help', 'Maladaptive Coping']",high

That s the oldest I ve ever been It s the oldest I m ever meant to be I don t remember when I had the first dream It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn t even be able to remember They are always fragmented and real Real in the way that when it ends your eyes open and you re lying in bed wondering Did I just wake up or just fall asleep The fragments don t seem to follow a timeline just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out Remembering moments out of a long series of events In these dreams I ve seen the events of my life tragic and wonderful play out before me Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline It took time to get used to having these dreams especially the dark ones the ones where a friend or family member passes and I m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments It wasn t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were As stupid as it sounds clairvoyance runs in the family If you believe in that type of thing I ve cousins who experience the same We ve talked about them shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us Out of the thousands of dreams every one of which that has so far played in my synapses not one of them shows me past the age of My th birthday is now less than days away I ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now Before I had ever met my wife I had come to a decision I wasn t going to live past the age of in fact I was going to end my life on my th birthday I can t say for certain why I chose Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young I should join the group of others who died famously young at except I m far from famous also happens to be my favorite number I could not tell you why I ve always just been drawn to it When my th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of months To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you The plan I d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day But my plans had changed It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age The limit was always twenty nine There are none where I m a proud father watching my children go None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who s aged so much better than I over the years After they just stop We fixate on negatives humans that is It s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives I m far from being a master at this myself Why don t I see myself as older than in any of these Is it because that s when my story ends Will my life be destined to have a dash between Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board Or is it something more positive Does the family s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life Is it a gift we are given to be shown in part the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become Glimpses to show us that no matter how low and dark things are going to get you are going to make it through this Maybe we aren t clairvoyant Odds are it s just the family disposition for schizophrenia another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics I ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics Is it going to end at am I going to see the other side of If I don t is it going to be my own doing Maybe I m not allowed to see how my own story ends not until I experience it first hand so as to not spoil the moment I don t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation I did at one point but then I accepted that part myself The part that feels knows that suicide is an option I can t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately Others are turned and inspected what if situations played out over and over How would she react What would the funeral look like How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down Some may topple like my own but there would be many that would wobble for ages Likely never settling back down into their original position That s the hardest hurdle for me in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself My empathy for those in my life knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs More so if it was self inflicted It has always been easy to hurt myself Intentionally hurting others that I care about though has always felt impossible I know I ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact again and again So I ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others feelings and selfishly satisfy my own I m not even sure what to call it desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending Perhaps it does end but not by any doing of myself Just the chaos of existence With some luck maybe Just maybe isn t the end It s just a new beginning,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help',

This person was my boyfriend for 5 years, we started having bad arguments and then we broke up, i wanted to try again since he actually got diagnosed with bpd after the relationship and has started treatment and therapy, i want to try again as the whole perspective is different now.

Not going to live to I ve known for many years now that I m not going to live to see Now I m and the past month has only solidified that fact It s been days since I was fired from my job and a week after that my car was broken into they stole a subwoofer and broke the ignition and insurance won t cover any of it I m waiting weeks and weeks for unemployment to be approved and that s not even a sure thing because if they determine I was fired for misconduct they will deny my claim altogether I was fired because I missed about a week and a half of work because of insomnia that came out of nowhere I was getting about hours of sleep a day after about hours trying to fall asleep After multiple trips to the doctor they put me on trazodone and it helped so I called work told them I thought I was going to be able to make it into work again and they told me they don t want me back So unless I find a job in the next month or so I m going to lose my car Can t afford to pay rent AND car payments AND insurance on the pathetic unemployment they ve determined I m eligible if I even get anything If I don t it s a matter of time before my roommates kick me out anyways I have nowhere to go if that happens I ll be on the street Between my emotionally abusive mother treating me like shit since I was a child bullying in school shitty jobs losing the only woman I ever loved to suicide and finally this combo of shit the past month I ve never really felt like I wanted to continue living In the past it s always been just hoping that a truck hits and kills me or something accidental so I didn t cause so much grief to my family for ending my own life but I just don t care anymore Tired of my family and friends basically throwing money at me to get me by even though I ve told them it makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit Tired of expecting things to get worse and being proven right time and time again despite my effort to get help Tired of psychiatrist after psychiatrist prescribing pill after pill that does nothing but give me horrible withdrawals when I m coming off I ve spent hours researching the way I want to go and I ve found it I found a way that gives me all the time i need to make my final calls to friends and family without anybody being able to physically interfere with my plans and it won t leave me in pain in the hospital it s a sure death This is not impulse or irrational or depression clouding my judgement This is deciding that my life has been shit and there s no reason to believe it will get any better and I am making the decision to end the pain I ve decided that if my unemployment claim gets denied it s time to go I m not going to go through being homeless not having the food water and shelter that I need to survive I debated posting this here at all and there s been several days before this where I decided not to but I guess I m posting here for the same reason I m starting my psychiatric counseling again next week I want my family and friends to know that I ve tried everything within my power to improve my life before I make the decision to end it Hopefully that will give them some peace of mind once I m gone So if you ve got anything I haven t already heard feel free to post it,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Here s my rant about being miserable and depressed It helps to write it out even if it makes me cry more Basically everyone but my boyfriend and parents think I m pretty much fine including my professors school friends My boyfriend knows I m extremely depressed and suicidal and my parents know I m as bad as I was when I was which implies the same My therapist probably knows I m suicidal but I promised myself years ago when it was this bad before I d never go to a mental hospital again voluntarily because it s extremely traumatic for me I stopped seeing her because I don t want her to involuntarily commit me Specifically going between now and early January is an over my dead body type option because I ve been procrastinating grad school applications and need to finish them all by early January Going to the mental hospital literally rips away my support system and coping mechanisms completely such as talking to my boyfriend going on Reddit playing video games listening to people on discord sleeping as much as I want eating food I like etc The hospital also makes it so I might not be able to graduate from college on time or get bad grades which would mean I d have to reapply to graduate programs which would be enough to make me actually do it I m a good student and have a and a in my major which is great I have a really competitive internship in my field of study lined up for the spring in addition to my prior related work experience I love my field and feel like I m actually helping people My professors love me and almost all of them are willing to give me a letter of recommendation for grad school which is great The problem is no one would fucking believe that I m constantly suicidal and taking a semester off isn t an option I have a disability hearing or whatever it s called in March I m scared it s going to come out that I m very suicidal and I ll be sent off to the hospital again Like I m in a catch be re traumatized and potentially have to go to the hospital again and not graduate on time or have them not understand the gravity of the situation The guy who s the judge clearly doesn t get mental health stuff in my opinion based on previous times I ve talked with him It s like either go full NEET be hospitalized not regulate myself and they take me seriously or try to make a future for myself and be less suicidal and they don t take me seriously at all Being able to hold down easy credits of coursework that requires maybe hours of work a day and hrs a week internship isn t the same as being able to hold down a hour a week job My boyfriend is fucking incredible and the most supportive person aside from my parents I ve ever met I can t imagine life without him The problem is I feel so utterly inadequate because he has a physical disability that makes it so I have to do a lot of the chores like taking out the trash doing dishes etc yet I have fucking meltdowns that I can t control like crying fits if I m asked to do almost anything most of the time I get so short with him and lose it over tint stuff because I m so constantly miserable It s not intentional at all and I love him so much and do my best to be supportive of him I m so afraid of losing him yet I can t fucking control myself He can work and stuff thankfully at least and works in a well paying industry that he is really talented at I ve probably gained lbs in years easily from depression eating I went from pretty toned hourglass shape lifting weights x a week and walking tons around lbs at and about a size to now maybe a size x and lbs I m covered in unappealing stretch marks I haven t brushed my hair in a month or two so it s extremely tangled and knotted I struggle to brush my teeth I wear dirty clothes for weeks at a time I shower maybe once every three weeks I wish I was kidding I have very little interest in sex or anything like that but I try to at least once a week initiate something with my boyfriend because I don t want him to leave me He basically says it s not necessary to do this but I just don t want him to leave me I have a lot of weed because I m in a legal state temporarily and it s one of the only things that helps I don t take other medication because since covid I literally can t remember to especially not twice a day Also the old medication made me have shitty side effects like being difficult to orgasm sleep hrs a day made me extremely nauseous and didn t really help that much with my mood I ve tried basically every medication in the book I have a really weird case and rarely get concrete diagnoses I think I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder if I had to guess after being a former psych major for a while plus the diagnosis I ve heard from former psychiatrists But I ve also been encouraged to be tested for autism by a psychiatrist which I also think could explain a ton That s basically how I ve been doing It kinda helped a little to write out my feelings so thank

is this sh a bit of backstory i was diagnosed with anxiety in 2021 and have been on medication since i have no history of sh or thoughts about it i also have been working at a big restaurantbar for about 6 months and really dislike it but i need the money this happened at work about 2 months ago now so it was a hot day and i was scheduled to work for about 8 hours there were lots of wasps around in the outside eating area and they have been known to sting about 3 hours into my shift and i was feeling extremely anxious i found it really hard to concentrate or talk to customers i ended up going to the bathroom and after about 20 mintues i decided to needed to leave and go home all i could think of at the time was to fake getting stung by the wasp to do this i used to end of my key to twist and dig into my skin until it was very red and broke skin i then told my shift manager i have an allergy and need to go home my shift manager sent me home and immediately i felt way better and more calm looking back on it a few months later i have a scar on my arm but i havent thought of doing anything similar since i just wanted to vent and see what you guys think about this or if i should be concerned thanks,"['Cause of Distress', 'Mood Tracking']",medium

I m only years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long I m only only according to what people say years old and even though I wouldn t say I feel old exactly I m always thinking about our finite youth about ageing and our mortality I can t get it out of my head A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they re and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes as a year old with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes I m inevitably miserable in these pictures I see people I like admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises I m extremely scared of ageing you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me I m scared of regrets I m scared of ending up a nobody I m scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally I can t stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future I feel so much guilt when I m not efficient in what I m doing I feel so bad about myself my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty I hate myself for being too weak I really REALLY want this thing but I m so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can t pull through I want it so much that I want to cry It s more like a necessity than a mere desire The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating but having to do the work exhausts me emotionally I know at least one of the reasons why this happens meaning perhaps there are others but I m too embarrassed to tell anyone let alone publicly The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown with difficulty I partially told her my dream why I want it and why it s so important to me and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful It s not a crime or anything like that but it s something I feel is ridiculous and laughable something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am or have become One of my fears is having to commit suicide in the future between and years from now due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt I know I won t find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don t achieve my dream at least partially or if I don t achieve it in the time period I need to This is because my goal heavily depends on my age and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that My goal is along the lines of enjoy your young years doing things that years olds are Time itself is part of the specifications of my goal year olds or late year olds hanging out with early year olds is weird and unacceptable and I wouldn t feel part of the group either I want to hang out with year olds AS a year old but right now I can t I ve already wasted so much time isolating myself for years in my room with my computer not hanging out with people my age not gaining experiences not making memories but now what I want is something slightly different And being so ambitious or demanding sometimes makes me feel bad too Perhaps I m just a spoiled kid who hasn t grown up yet and learned of life Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable make peace with a life without this delusional grandeur dream of mine and live peacefully where I am I know progress can t be accelerated so much I do know it but I so wish it could you don t know much this pains me Life is so painful ageing is so painful your face changing and getting more year old looking is so painful I want to stay this age forever hang out with people my age all over the world celebrate with them suffer with them talk with them know of their dreams and fears learn about their subcultures be part of the group etc That last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want but yea as you see it s kind of stupid,"['Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

I feel like everyday is getting harder and harderNow before I say much I wanna establish that I am not clinically depressed because I ve never gone to a therapist and also I think depression is just a little too serious for me to have at the age of I wouldn t like to insult anyone actually having depression by saying that I have depression because I really don t have a reason or diagnosis to think so Anyway I ll give the short note here I was groped by a guy who worked at my house twice and I still cry about it That was years ago My ex boyfriend forced himself on me not fully but enough for me to tell him no and he wasn t listening to me I was also forcefully dragged into a dark alleyway by a friend who was at the time and kissed forcefully and also put in like a physical lock so I couldn t leave I was Plus now I m in th grade and will have to find a college soon but I don t have anh interests I can draw and everyone keeps forcing me to join fashion designing but I don t want to because I don t like it I wanted to be a singer but I cannot sing There s virtually nothing left for me I don t wanna join art or music and I have no academic or political interests That eliminates everything And I m stressed out and to the point where I would rather just die and than to face the disappointing faces of everyone when everyone is off to college and I still haven t figured it out and god knows that they don t take it very well here in India Here you HAVE to go to college after th no exceptions or going after a few years So I m pretty much ready to die Anyway those are just the things that happened to me and I felt weird typing it out to strangers so I hope nobody trolls me lol These things have taken a toll on me through the years as I didn t feel as strongly about them back then as I do now They really make me cry every night and feel disgusted in every single way But these things don t compare to the guilt I feel for what all I ve done to the people I love Well for starters I m very rude to my friends and I make cruel jokes at them They know I m joking but now I just feel bad I feel like they don t like me at all and don t want me around them Secondly I ve broken up a group of friends I had I had a very big group of guy friends years ago my boyfriend and the other guy come from this group and they were all boys and I was the only girl in the group I don t know how or why but suddenly of them had a crush on me Mind you I m not cute at all and like I said I m rude and mean so I really don t know what they saw Anyway one of them became my now ex boyfriend whom I mentioned earlier and I kind of juggled between the other and I feel horrible They eventually because of that reason got jealous and hateful of each other and the group broke up but not in a traditional way We still hung out but it was just not the same anymore Obviously I caused that by being so indecisive and mind my language hoe y Then I broke up with my then boyfriend and got with a friend who had a crush on me from the group and he is the best thing to ever happen to me We are sti together to this day and he really loves me and appreciates me I m not sure about it anymore though You see I am a horrible person and I did a horrible thing to him even though I love him the most and he is the best boyfriend ever We have a long distance relationship and that s important because we usually talk over texts and calls and meet once a month In we moved to another place and I made some friends at school I started talking to this guy as friends because he was my classmate and we chatted once in a while One day the conversation just hit the fan and got really weirdly sexual but we were joking and just laughing about it all Now I realize how weird that was and how it was cheating So anyway a few months ago J wanted my boyfriend to read a chat so I gave him my Instagram password He opened my ID read the chat and we were cool Later though naturally he checked out my ID while I checked out his He found that chat and it s weird because I had a load of conversation after that which was just normal but I don t know and why he scrolled that much into the past that he found it I guess he was already suspicious So he found it and confronted me about it in a very non confrontational way and he said he was very hurt I told him it was a joke and it can be seen in the way the friend and I were replying to each other But obviously he was upset and his trust was broken and I apologized profusely and did everything I could to make things better and eventually everything went back to normal kind of So a few days ago we were chatting as usual and I noticed that since a few days he wasn t like responding to anything sexual about me or like if I sent him a picture or a text like that I asked him and he said he can t tell me the reason but he just doesn t like to sexy anymore because it makes him mad at me I was shattered but I already knew why he was saying that Then after a few days I asked him to tell me the reason and I was right He told me it was because of that thing and I apologised and he said he understands I m not that person anymore but that he just can t do it over text otherwise it reminds him of that and he feels disgusted Understandable I was so very sad and upset and felt guilty all over again But here s the catch since a few days things have gotten somewhat better between us and he assures me that he still loves me but I know he s lying The guilt and regret just keeps on getting bigger and bigger and bigger Now I can t take it and it s not even the fact that he doesn t love me because I know why It s just the fact that I wod hurt someone like him who has helped me through everything I ve described in the second paragraph and has made me a better person the realisation that even though I did not intend to do it I sti very much cheated on my own boyfriend when I preach that cheating is the worst thing ever and the fact that no matter if he leaves me or things get better nothonf will reverse this action of mine and things and trust wi never be the same again That s the worst part it s irreversible Lately the guilt has gotten to the point where I want to die It has mixed with all the experiences and actions of mine from the past and now I don t even want to get better I just want it to end and die There s no solution I don t want a solution I just want out Nobody will care after I die because I ve successfully hurt and betrayed everyone that ever would care Nobody will miss me Nobody even likes me I don t hate my appearance as much but it s not good I don t love myself in any way because of all the things I described All I want now is either a solution as to how I can die painlessly because I m a coward or just a reverse button to everything I just typed to vent and I ve told this all to my boyfriend and he tried his best to reassure me that I m wrong and that whatever I m saying will get better but I know it won t because the only way it can get better for me or for me to make peace with it is that it never would have happened and that s impossible to do There s not way for me only out So I don t know what responses to expect from anyone if I get any that is but just Don t tell me to tell my parents as they won t listen and I don t want to share my private stuff with them as you can see this is all very weird to tell to my parents Plus my brother almost tried to kill himself last year and we are still dealing with his depression to be dealing with mine too Plus my mother is very tired and sad in her life I don t wanna make it worse for her I already do enough of that everyday by being a horrible child Don t tell me to go to a therapist as I can t without my parents and I

with guilt there s not much to be done Don t suggest trivial things like go out more or talk to your friends and stuff because it doesn t help and if you know how that works you know Please don t make it any weirder than it has to be I was already embarrassed about typing this because of all the things I ve done so please don t say anything to that Don t be mean about my boyfriend or my friends or my family They re all amazing people and you re not anybody to judge them You can criticize them if there is even any criticism over the details I gave but nothing from your side as you don t know

What Happens Next Throw away I don t know what to think anymore I ve had an average childhood with a family that loves me and they re the only thing keeping me from ending it all Ever since I got out of the military five years ago my life has been in shambles I drove a lot of my old friends away from chronic alcoholism and just feel disconnected from people I eventually quit drinking and things got better for a bit but nothing great happened I worked a bunch of shitty part time jobs because I have a minor misdemeanor that prevents me from getting jobs that were once my dream So I pursued a degree in a trade I thought I wanted to do but didn t certify in So now I have a degree but nobody wants to hire me because of the lack of certification and now I m so fed up I don t even want to pursue that education anymore I ve used up my GI Bill and am in credit card debt I m stuck living with my parents and although I m greatly appreciative of it I m absolutely embarrassed that I do at years old I m sick of failure I m sick of it all All I want to do is go back in a time machine and stay in the military I thought life would get better when I got out but what point did it matter Life got worst inside No girl has ever loved me and never will and I m gonna be years old working at some shitty job living with my parents I just don t want to deal with this anymore I ve dealt with this thought for five years and have even sold my gun to prevent it but it s just becoming too much for me inside I want a way out,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting poetic justice Is that the right term This is what I mean As far as I know my school s never had a suicide If anyone should kill themselves not that anyone should it should be me It would have the biggest effect if it was me It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn t be SURPRISED I was very severely bullied every day for years by people and about at once The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it I was the most hated person in the year maybe even the school for NO REASON Or at least nothing in my control Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity I have been depressed for about the last years And I have very very few friends and no social life at all Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me I just burst into tears writing this I didn t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for years If I killed myself all those kids would think She really did it and would say WE drove her to this and kids at neighbouring schools would say You know my name who got picked on She committed suicide and A girl from my school killed herself And Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd thinking Oh it s my name so it s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it s nothing and now she s dead Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe definitely reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double Maybe that was my purpose after all Also no one would care if I wasn t there I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout GET OUT LARA NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE in such a sincere way They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there No one really cares about me Or maybe they all care just not enough The only way people would care about me is if I was dead Similarly I ve been thinking what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all forever I don t want to stall too much so that I ve left school when I do it because then the school won t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn t because of them I don t want the wrong people to be blamed I don t know how much longer I can go on It s like a candle is burning and I don t know how much is left of it height but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn t much It wouldn t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Hey Lar home http i imgur com nD j jpg Your arms were the only ones in which I was truly loved and safe Yeah I get it your own parent not wanting you After you died Mom made it really clear I was a nuisance She left me with pedophiles more than one with me literally begging and screaming for her not to walk out that door while they sat there awaiting the pleasure they d take with me the second she left Even if she was in the next room or taking a quick shower I was the fuckdolly Did you know that one of them was at me for years Yeah he d kill my pets to keep me quiet Another one of her boyfriends Had my childhood dog EB for years he drowned her in the bathtub He killed several Told me Mom would hate me if she ever found out that I had turned him on so much that he had to fuck me until he was completely satisfied Yeah she managed to throw this in my face when she found out jealousy over maternal instinct She s a fucking abusive cunt This was along with all the violent beatings he laid on mom and me not to mention that he kept us indoors and isolated for years aside from the times he was in and out of prison Know how all this came out He knocked me up at the ripe old age of I had to have an abortion He was going to be charged with several things not just for the sexual part but unlawful confinement too Did you know that Mom always treated me like a nuisance even before the pedos telling me that she wished I d never been born screaming Are you fucking retarded if I did something kids normally do such as accidently tipping my juice over at breakfast or took too long doing dishes Enter her violent blowups slaps punches being dragged around by my hair while she screamed visciously Bitch loved to slam her fist between my shoulder blades when I didn t even see it coming I lived in constant fear in childhood I acted out not knowing how to relate to others alienating my peers at school No friends the girl everyone scorned There was no comfort when I was told No one likes you with such vehemence that it still burns in my memory to this day You have no idea how this has isolated me fuck people Not going anywhere near them Isolation is my greatest defence When you have it drilled in your head that you re unwanted it sticks so deeply It burns into the deepest trenches of your being Mom dragged to that fucking tiny hellhole she s from Think that went well You know the one where they re tighter than thieves I was so beaten down and shy of course they took it as me thinking I was better than them I couldn t even look anyone in the eye I was so shy The curled their upper lip when I d pass by I did nothing to deserve this I never hurt any of them I d only wanted to be accepted It didn t help that her next husband tried to convince me I m crazy because I only knew to isolate and couldn t talk to anyone I love my mom no matter what she did and I d call him on his obnoxious behaviour towards her and it made us enemies I hated him deeply as he was a bully and knew she d do anything in her codepent clingy way to keep him He d told me ways of disposing of bodies and not get caught told me he would have killed my mother once if I hadn t walked in the room He d sliced up the mother of his son to the point that he d had served time in a criminal psch ward and arrogantly defended his actions going on about how she deserved it and how much he hated her Whenever he didn t like someone his first comment was that there was something wrong with them in the head Holy fuck pot calling the kettle black or what eh There s can t really be anything truly wrong with me I was just kicked around too much wasn t I Please tell me I m not crazy it s eaten away at me for years I know rationally I m not crazy but this fucking neurotic bullshit eats at me I was truly happy when he died he was evil I d rather have O brien and the other pedophiles than him Fuck everyone thought he was so nice good old uncle rick Piece of motherfucking shit even his corpse is a waste of space Did you know that mom got a lot of money from criminal injuries when you died She was supposed to save it for me but spent it on herself a house and her boyfriends I was lucky to fucking eat or get rags from fucking thrift stores for clothes She still gets cheques each month while your grandkids sit in poverty I took out student loans trying to make something of my self and the debt of it is fucking crushing I nearly finished my degree but trying to make it on my own with the kids too soon after birth nearly killed me Postpartum depression and the stress of it all I ve tried to be strong The kids dad left even before your grandaughter was born I gave birth to her going to university full time and still made the first year winning a scholarship I struggled against depression best I could but I dropped out three times over the years each time summoning stubborn strength to meet the goal of graduating Three strikes I was out No more access to means to finish No jobs to cover tuition loans wiped their hands of me understandably My own stubborn will to try and complete blew up in my face Left with lots of theory and all the pretentious academic terms to describe them but not one practical skill from it all Nonetheless you grandkids You d be so fucking proud of those two hearts of gold and that sparking humour and brains we got from you certainly not her I know you d have spoiled us Mom told us that you really really loved me more than anything you d ever in your life I know that if you were as ga ga over me as you were you d be twice as much over them Nonetheless we struggle I ve been so isolated for most of my life O brien Mom that hellhole she dragged me to settling for the prick of a biological father and more isolation trying to raise the babies in a two bedroom apartment for years not a soul to turn to Not a way to reach out as the isloation eroded any sort of chance to build the means to reach out connect and bond with anyone We re stuck in poverty there s no fucking jobs in this fucking dead end town and even if there were I freeze paralyzed when I try to interact They won I get it I m stupid I m crazy and I m unwelcome I am not allowed to be life if for other people From what Mom tells me you would have have stood before stampedes to protect me I was the apple of your eye you loved me because I was the only thing you ever loved or were loved by Fuck all this shit is just the tip of the iceberg I spoke to your little sister without telling her my intentions and she d be happy to take the kids in case anything happened to me They re better off without me I m so fucking stressed out and scared all the time snarling and isolating from them and everyone else in the world They d be better off with her They re the only things I love in this world but I m no good for them Daddy please I m so fucking scared I m so fucking shoved away I tried I really truly did I ve tried to get education and make things better I ve tried to be the best person I can but nothing helps Please take me back to you Just hold me in your arms make it all go away I ve given it my best shot but over three decades of this shit truly has me worn down I can t go on like this I need to be back in your arms where we loved each other and we were home At the time I could afford it I had a gravestone made for you as I d spent years looking for your grave and no one told me that you were so uncared for that no one had bothered Your own father my mother Both had the means to do so but hey it was all about them you know I just had your name tattoed on me to honour you proudly carrying you with me forever so you know that yes someone loved you sincerely I can t do this anymore however I ve struggled and tried to do my

Advice I m so scared I m going to do something stupid I m more scared I m actually thinking about doing it So I ve always thought about suicide as a teenager but it got a lot worse when I got diagnosed with Cancer at The thing is I always said I couldn t do it because of my mum and family my mum more than anything I put her through so much especially the cancer she took care of me and I love her so much but now not even that thought is stopping me wanting to do it I just want everything to stop right now I was sent to therapy just after I went into remission but I feel like it made everything worse I think a lot more about the things we uncovered Although I m sure it works for other people and that s amazing but I couldn t keep going to it I think the problem is I did start to feel better talking to her and one day she reminded me that this can t go on forever as we were just here to talk about the Cancer By that time I was pretty okay but I felt like I was taking too much time of off work so I agreed to end it there Then there s the fact that since Monday I ve been waking up and feeling to throw up and every morning I think the same thing you can do it right now while your sisters asleep and your mums at work I just miss having someone to talk about these feelings should I tell my mum how I m feeling Or like my friend in work But what is he tells my boss,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk I talked about football with this random guy I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide I sat at the bar almost falling off the stool and it really hit me this time I really could kill myself tonight I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying Was it peaceful was it scary was it just somewhere in between What it is is the feeling that beyond a shadow of a doubt you would not feel the consequences of suicide because you will be dead All of my friends My family If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them but in reality I won t exist it won t effect me it will be nothing I silently decided ok I think tonight is the night I stood up turned to the guy I was talking to smiled and told him to have a great night He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ok you too and I left My first thought was are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to And immediately I thought yes Who cares It s all symbolic horse shit that won t mean anything after I m dead It s the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach and that s never been me so why should I care I left the bar and just started walking I didn t know where I was going but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars all with a major a plan a path I ve never really envied them or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet for better or for worse Last night though I couldn t help but find the humor in it Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone that I went to school somewhere that I had an identity outside of being nobody It made me think about how there s probably plenty of people I see actively contemplating their death that just blend in like me It made me think even if it were just for a second to reconsider what I aimed to do that night I thought about it for a second I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning Then I remembered I already made my choice I didn t sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now I intended to do what I ve known needed to be done since I was I kept walking and walking and walking I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health I thought about how now in retrospect I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson It was about AM at this point I finally reached a highway It wasn t like an interstate more like a lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it I d see these wheelers come buy at MPH Upon seeing this I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things I thought about it for a second What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident What if it killed other people but not me I couldn t bring myself to do it for that reason I continued walking down the highway Even though I wasn t gonna jump in front of one of these cars everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road I walked until I saw a park I don t know what possessed me but I just entered the park with no intention I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it I leaned over the side and vomited then I passed out I woke up hours later with an awful headache Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it and I let it slip away I don t know when I ll ever be able to capture it again Today I woke back up in purgatory where I ll remain Life is endless suffering,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking']",high

The next day WITHOUT ANY TRIGGERS I hate them, don’t want them to be happy etc. I’m aware that I split when I’m triggered but this is different than splitting. Same goes with everything else in my life. Standards, morals, etc. It’s just like some hours of the day I have these overwhelming lovey dovey euphoric feelings and then a minute later I’m in agonizing pain, for no reason at all. What does this mean? I feel like I can do all the DBT in the world but it would never fix this part of me.

I can t pretend anymore tl dr my roommate is an asshole who is no longer content with the agreement we made when I moved in with him keeps threatening to ship me back to my abusive mother who I moved in with him to get away from in the first place and instead of telling me something as important as our financial aid got cut off last night when it happened waited until we were fighting this morning to yell it at me and then blame me because of all the stress he s under And it s making me feel like actually killing myself for the first time in over a decade The long version I m clearly not wanted here I told him point blank when I moved in that I have several diagnosis that label me disabled both physically and mentally and I ve applied for disability twice only to be denied and don t have the funds now to try a third time I told him that I cannot work a regular job so unless he was willing to put his social network here to use since I don t have one and help me find something I wouldn t be able to work We made the agreement that I d be a live in maid and I said hell yeah and have been keeping up my end of the deal ever since But in these past months he s clearly grown tired of that He says my disabilities are an excuse for me to be lazy He says I could work if I tried but he hasn t been in my shoes The last retail positions I held led to a repeated mental breakdowns in the middle of the store during my shift for things like a customer yelling at me or a co worker being rude and b so much pain that I literally came home cried myself to sleep woke up enough to shower and eat and then go back to work and rinse repeat The short time I had those jobs I was miserable I led a miserable existence and actually contemplated suicide for the first time since about years earlier when I had actually seriously tried twice in a row On top of that I was pretty much given the diagnosis of hey yeah those mental breakdowns are bad for your mental health they worsen my anxiety and depression and oh that pain in your legs and feet means you re over stretching something and if you keep doing that you might end up in a wheelchair forever so no jobs like that if you care about your health But this is my fault right I m giving out excuses I m lazy I deserve to go back to the mother who verbally mentally and emotionally abused me for over years of my life and who according to at least separate therapists I saw is likely the cause of my anxiety and depression in the first place and whose actions caused me to try to kill myself twice in the past I deserve to go back to her even though she made it plain to me that if my roommate ever saw fit to do that I d be homeless because she would bring me home only to kick me out again because she s not supporting me all my life Or maybe I deserve to go into that bathroom in the room next to me lock the door and run a bath in the tub and try again After all my roommate could move back in with his parents if he didn t have to worry about me since they won t take me in too I wouldn t be holding him back anymore like he says all the time I d be one less expense he has to pay and hell maybe he could even sell my stuff for a decent amount and that d buy him enough time to find a job and all that Just like my mom he d be better off I wasn t dragging him down all the time,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"So we cut back on my Seroquel and I’ve been doing so much better. Decided we to try propanol for heightened GAD instead.
 
 Last night I decided to take it upon myself to just cut it out altogether. Not sure if it’s just a coincidence or if it’s related but today I’m Uber depressed, very suicidal. I keep ruminating over my behaviors. So much guilt, pain, and feeling like a terrible person. From things like ten years ago but it’s hard to let them go. I write poetry and short form literature to cope. Wanted to share.
 
 I really just want to kill myself today
 
 My stomach is so nauseous
 
 Heightened anxiety
 
 Can’t shake the feeling that I’m a bad person
 
 What if I really don’t care about people
 
 And all I care about is how they make me feel or what they can do for me
 
 That thought is traumatizing
 
 I don’t want to be a manipulator
 
 I don’t want to hurt people or use them for my benefit
 
 What if I can’t ever love and feel real empathy
 
 What if I’ll always be a sad selfish person concerned with my own despair
 
 I don’t even want to tell people how I feel anymore
 
 I’m so sick of saying the same thing and hearing the same shit
 
 A broken record on repeat
 
 I know im annoying, and I don’t want to be a burden
 
 I want to be the reason people smile, to be someones safe haven
 
 But all I ever do is use people
 
 Im haunted by past memories, throwing away friends for male attention
 
 Whoever was a gateway for guys, my drug
 
 Treating people like pawns Just to get my fix
 
 Desperately desiring attention Because it made me feel like whole
 
 I wasn’t a person without someone else
 
 Reminding me of who I was
 
 And sometimes I still feel this way
 Like an addict in relapse
 
 Remind myself I don’t need anyone else
 
 But the emptiness makes me an emotional mess
 
 As long as I have someone to love, to please
 To care for
 
 Or as long as someone else is showering me with the attention and validation I need
 
 Then I’m complete
 
 But without, its like a drought
 
 No idea who I am
 
 Im so sorry, please forgive me

 on the third day of waking up then going to bed extremely anxious and on the verge of a panic attack i went to my general doctor from there they prescribed me 5mg xanax twice daily as needed the alprazolam did not help it just dampened the sense of panic and i still had most of my physical symptoms 
 
 my question to everyone who reads this is â€œwhat do you do to mitigate these annoying side effects and are there any natural remediesâ€
 
 ps iâ€™m on gabapentin 300mg 3x a day propanalol 30mg twice daily guanfacine 3mg er lexapro 30mg and trazadone 50mg all of which did nothing to help with these feelings the past two weeks","['Mood Tracking', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help']",medium

somebody its not that i am killing myself right now but the direction i am heading is not good it will be a matter of time so any suggestion would be appreciated tldr These are my weird and bizarre thoughts and stories so far I know these are very poor mentality thoughts but it is true what i feel Now i realised that back when i was in school i have somewhat OCD I used to align carpets symmetrically and books in order idk why but i used to do it Grade diagnosed with sinusitis and eye problem and later migraine went to several hospitals everything became okay within months From childhood I was a lonely type small family and less talkative introvert but I used to play and it s very good Grade okay I used to align the bedsheet properly and wash leg frequently sometimes but it went in week In Grade I chose mathematics instead of biology idk why seeing others and thinking I cannot do and takes a huge amount of time and money idk if i had interest in anything at all had slight interest in becoming a doctor slight cause i have seen them working closely and it seems so reputed profession and all Sometimes I have irritability problems can t resist loud voices and sometimes even bad weather can affect my mood my mood depends on external factors My performance depends on external factors Now grade a deep voice constantly argues that u should have gone there that is your goal u came here seeing others and all and somewhere i feel i cheated myself Grades are good Everything is good Now I have started making few friends Cannot even connect to people Hoping Nobody likes me and all Some days I felt so alone too I did the entrance examination and I did well But now in college i feel more alone more lost that i don t even know where I am i am not feeling good Before even starting my career I am feeling I cannot I cheated myself I am not good I know nothing then idk why i became anxious I feel people are judging me i feel people dont like me i am not smart and this is a complete new field which might be to some extent true And i am running from myself Can t make genuine friends Confidence none self respect shattered Idk i feel i dont have good friends And i am becoming toxic Grade is not bad so far but i am not even close to what i could have done I am totally not happy i feel so lost so alone there are people around me but I feel lost And No everything is not okay I never sent a resume Because i don t think I am even worthy Even when some people ask me with care I feel i dont deserve anything good I should not be happy people don t like me My close friends dont like me This is a different field and i know nothing Day by day my self hatred grows I feel i am cheating on myself and i am fake I hardly go to relatives Because I feel i am not good enough smart enough I am not worthy I have let down its like i am hiding something and i don t want to go there its like i am not good and they wont like me And I feel so alone so lost let down and everything the more i try the more i go down i feel i dont have friends I cannot do anything amp i am done The college experience is so bad that i dont even want to appear i want an escape Now i dont want to code read write and all i just want to sleep all day and sometimes i wish i werenot even born I never applied to companies cause i dont even know what i am doing I cannot imagine my future it feels like i am just moving or doing this in just the shake of doing there is no extra hours and deep interest And at times i feel so irritated so angry that i don t like the place i don t like to code now feels like i am totally done then sometimes I think about fate palmistry existential crisis and all I feel so lost and isolated and sometimes i don t even know who i am i feel judged and people would find out No everything is not okay I am not feeling good not even a day i don t have proper skill i cannot connect with friends and i am done with fake smile i am done with faking i am not having good experience at all and when i see my parents and other ppl thinking he is smart and all Sometimes i burst into tears Not a thing is okay its not okay i have told for quite a few years that it will be okay but it is still the same i feel unconfident about me I am constantly let down I cannot do things I want to isolate myself Now sometimes I think I cannot learn anything I wont get a job I don t think how long i can bear like this sometimes I feel I am in huge trouble sometimes everything seems fine But I constantly swing back and forth between these emotions these days Now when I see myself i feel so sorry for myself Sorry for my parents If only I had no parents I would have quitted already It is okay from outside but it is not okay at all I feel so fucked up trapped and i don t think i can change anything how can I i don t have proper motivation I don t even know what i am doing who i am going to be where I am I hate myself and i don t think i can change anything constant thoughts that u are not good u cannot do anything The thing you are doing is quite not meaningful You dont like it You are so boring You just dont know it and all And the biggest problem is now i dont want to do it i have no motivation i dont want to do anything That feeling when you feel so lost Your charm is already lost Deep down you know you have been a failure and at this point sometimes it feels like it is easy to quit cause how could you even fight u are so fragile u cannot even tell anyone How could I tell that i am not feeling good about myself If only I had some interest motivation to do work less anxious and less edgy thoughts and a little bit of luck A hopeful and non disturbing thoughts things would change slowly Nothing is going good No nothing is good i don t have friends I am isolated I am at my worst i feel so negative about myself that i feel i have no one that understands me Idk why my mind constantly tell i would have become great in another field I am not satisfied with myself I am not happy i don t think i am complete within myself there are people around me but i feel so lost alone And i think its because of my lack of motivation towards career its not that i don t like this career but i idk why i feel so anxious and idk if because of my thoughts i am feeling low or because of my career i am feeling low i just don t know Last months have been the worst I felt so anxious restless Sometimes I could even imagine myself dead constant headaches vomiting living recklessly not caring about anything i just don t see any hope at times i thought death would be kindness somedays i dont think i can even make it somedays i feel so excited Restless So Hopeful i have even slept all day cried times a day stared at fan for hours everything seems so lost and mostly i just don t know what i am talking about Sometimes it feels it is there Sometimes it feels it is not there I get upset and excited very easily too Even slight things can upset me emotionally I hate myself so much and idk how i can change at all I feel so angry frustrated I cannot get angry at others i have zero interest to fight back too I have nothing in my checklist i am truly dead already that is true i just dont want to read code and learn anything zero motivation to do anything i feel i am not ready not enough and it is true i am not enough not ready i just think i cannot be good i cannot support my family make money and all i am just done How can I change What steps should I take I have ve motivations to read to earn money to go abroad to even exist but i want to be better and i just cannot change things i want things to change but i am done with even trying focusing for even a minute drains my all energy Tbh yes things might get better or not leave that but sometimes i just can sense my death i am feeling already my death I dont even know what is good or bad for my carrer i just dont know me now I dont want to be negative

My Experience with Forced Hospitalization long Early in NY In college Told someone I trusted I was feeling suicidal and was thinking about killing myself That person told a friend That friend told the school s counseling center Through a game of telephone news reach the police The police thought I was an immediate danger to myself I was sleeping woken up by loud knocking on my door telling me to come out and show them my hands Four cops were waiting outside my room one with a gun drawn Two more cops downstairs at the front door blocking the stairs this took place at a three story off campus house I said nothing as they asked me questions Denied their offer to take me to the hospital They said they would detain me for hours if I declined help and it would go on my record Didn t call their bluff so they took me away While questioning me they looked through my drawers and belongings presumably looking for weapons I couldn t use the bathroom or wash my teeth without supervision When I walked outside I saw cop cars and Public Safety car outside the house blue lights on At the hospital They made me put all my belongings into a bag change into patient clothes I was put into an interview room Nothing with sharp edges no breakable glass everything heavy plastic etc I didn t say anything unless asked For some naive reason I thought honestly answering their questions would get me out fastest The person explained what they thought the situation was and asked me to confirm A lot of their information was wrong The facts got distorted pretty heavily as they were passed through parties I acknowledged I was feeling suicidal and had planned to kill myself but didn t go through with it and was not currently planning anything The person went away came back with the conclusion that I had to be hospitalized for at least hours I found out the school had called my parents and they were on their way from miles away I was taken into the psych ward given a hygiene bag and assigned a roommate Some nurse asked me the same repeat questions as the first person It was almost the weekend and the doctor wouldn t be in until Monday so I had to stay the weekend Nothing to do My roommate was schizophrenic and whispered all night in his sleep Parents arrive Monday comes the doctor asks me the same questions prescribes Lexapro Says I need to stay at least more days to make sure I react well to the medicine but they can make me stay as long as they feel is necessary My parents and I fight this explain this is hurting more than is helping They say they understand but I have to stay at least more days I learn the only way to get out is to lie I have to lie at all their questions say I m feeling better from the medicine and am not having suicidal thoughts Five days pass I see a resident a psychiatrist a doctor etc All ask me the same exact questions all the same lies Lots of fighting every day with the hospital to have me released I m released They say I m lucky to have parents that care otherwise I could have easily been forced to stay another week I was released under the condition I would take the semester off go back home and see a therapist All three things are against my will but I needed to get out All in all a day stay Hospital bill arrives https i imgur com ffls K png after insurance out of pocket Counter intuitively left feeling much more suicidal than before A few months later and I m still pissed at the school the cops and the hospital I made a promise that when I kill myself I will call the people at the hospital responsible and make them aware it s partially their fault,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person I m at the end of my rope Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was and I am now Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that in tandem with my other mental illnesses rules my life To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago an event I had long figured would mark my demise I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing but in the days I spent in preparation I met an amazing person who is still my boyfriend I get by for a year with a lot of his help but then lose my job That was six months ago I move in with my boyfriend We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep insomnia is was already an issue so before I know it my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep I m scared to leave the house but so miserable and constantly incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped I fear that dying is the only way out I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it I would love to just run away and live in my car was homeless once but I m dependent upon both my medication and unfortunately opiates The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief though they re obviously a double edged sword I can t get off my meds either as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again So I m stuck with no job a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave a substance dependence that won t allow me any freedom that I m not too afraid of and zero future prospects And this is a very general list If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life this post would be even more lengthy I don t want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family but I can t keep this life up I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend but after waiting all week an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed He works long tomorrow I really don t think I can t make it another day,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
I don t want to live but I don t want to kill myselfI m and I never thought that my friends would be my biggest bullies Over the past few weeks I ve come to the realization that they aren t nice to me anymore constantly making fun of me and I can t even remember the last time they did said anything nice to me I have a few friends left who I love to death but I hardly get to see them now that we go to separate schools My school in general hasn t helped me feel better as my grades sink lower and lower I just found out my dad was diagnosed with depression and I m to scared to talk to my parents about it For the past week I ve wanted to be dead but I couldn t bring myself to harm myself Thinking about all the people who still care about me and the actions that would follow after death are the main reason I m still here I know I ll get recommendations to leave those friends but it s hard when I see them daily and I play games with them and run with them I m tired of living like this and I don t want to be here Thanks for letting me ramble And of my friends are reading this because they know my username I ve talked to you about how I feel and you continue to push me,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I can t stop feeling like I m drowning f M xico I have always experienced depression and generalized social anxiety For many years I ve tried to overcome it but I ve failed My parents love me but they have also hurt me in so many ways In some ways they have been harmful to me This year I planned to finally move away and start new detaching myself from my past but COVID changed it all I stayed at my parents house and little by little my savings ran out Every time I had plans to change and overcome this state of sadness but everything failed Some weeks my energy levels were so low I could barely leave bed I always started new plans always failed them at the end The thing is that I achieve so much but never finish the goal itself My parents tried to be supportive but I am aware that loving someone like me is unbearable My emotions change constantly and I m too sensitive to the world Everything affects me how people feel their mood the bad news are worse for me amp I m always scared of upsetting them I started seeing a new psychiatrist and he gave me antidepressants However I started to have panic attacks and anxiety attacks cry spells daily He immediately told me to stop the treatment and started to treat me for bipolar disorder Which did worked and I felt so happy but with Christmas coming my birthday and New Years I started to have more crying spells The thing is after every panic anxiety attack or crying spell my will to live was nonexistent I have been wanting to die for about weeks I have tried to fight this off but my mother and I have had bad exchanges lately She told me that she is exhausted of having to reassure me constantly that she loves me she is tired of me needing her hugs or wanting to watch shows with her constantly I started painting as a hobby and I started buying cute things from miniso to get an aesthetic that I enjoy for me besides saving to buy music I have never bought me things before but she considers it to be immature and told me to stop And I don t know I just feel so much but I don t feel anything at all I have been giving away and selling my things for a couple of days now and I can t stop I have been cleaning the house for hours nonstop to just keep it perfect and to remove every single part of me Being mentally ill has always put a wall between my family and me I have never been the daughter or the sister they want need and it breaks my heart I wish I was normal and that I could be what they want need My sister has told me how she has never felt she has an older sister because I can t act like one I don t feel like I have a purpose in my life at all And I m tired of always starting something and never ending it,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"CW: alcohol, sex, self harm 
 
 I’ve been binge drinking since I was 15. That’s just what you do here as a young person. Right away I think I didn’t have a good relationship with it. Back in highschool I used to drink to numb the pain. But I started noticing patterns like I probably had sex 99% of the time I binged. 
 
 I’ve been through the whole shebang with drinking. Fighting with friends and family, running away from home, unprotected sex, online shopping and dropping cash without a second thought. Trying drugs without second thought. Missing events and work. Cutting when I’ve been clean for months. I once shredded my legs to pieces at my own house party because someone hurt my feelings.
 
 When I drink, all the darkest parts of me come out. My inhibition is insane. It’s like my BPD is just sitting there waiting tor me to drink. I never pass out, I want to keep going. I become a huge fucking people pleaser. I know an issue of mine is I want everyone to like me. I want everyone to think I’m cool and awesome and the best. When I drink I will do anything to seem “chill”. Often this involves acting out of character. I will over share to death. I’ll get flirty just to try to seem desirable.
 
 I’m 23 now and in most aspects of my life I’m thriving. I have a healthy relationship, an apartment. Nearing the end of a bachelors degree. I want so badly to be a good person. I think I am a good person, I just have this fucking demon. The anxiety I have after a night of drinking is insane. It can last weeks. My boyfriend is extremely kind and understanding but that doesn’t stop my guilt. I wouldn’t want to be him. This part of me makes me feel unlovable. And I don’t want something to happen I can’t come back from. And i’m so tired of this anxiety. It makes me want to end my shit more than my bpd. 
 
 I’ve had therapists want me to go to AA and it’s just pissed me off. I always think I’m so young or it’s not like I’m drunk all the time. But now my psychiatrist wants me to go. And I’m breaking. I’m wearing myself down.","['Critical Risk', 'Maladaptive Coping']",high
My StoryI ve been heavily addicted to drugs marijuana opiates benzos for the past decade I quit opiates a year ago and am current days sober from weed I m prescribed klonopin because I do suffer from GAD but I do abuse them As a child I was emotionally abused by both my parents My dad can only understand money and sports I didn t like sports nor was I very good at them but he made me play them all not exaggerating which created a cycle of disappointment humiliation and emasculation My mother has some undiagnosed personality disorder She spent most of my childhood either crying having imaginary fights with me when I d be in an entirely different part of the house and making me take her medication because she said I was the reason she was so sad I got into a good college in and then the financial crash of happened Intellectually unqualified for any field of study with job security I studied English Lit got through college smoking myself into isolation and barely crawling out with zero distinction or careee goals Upon graduating I moved back home My dad always one to shove square pegs into round holes said I had to work for him and got me a job selling insurance in my hometown while everyone I knew fro college moved to Brooklyn or Los Angeles to intern at some prestige bullshit or stay in the womb of academia and get masters or their ph d It was during this time that my mom decided to become an alcoholic This was enough and so I just moved about hours away from my family to temporarily live with my sister who git me a job but who s understandably put some limits on the time I can live with her I m consumed with anger regret and isolation Quitting pot means I m fighting a long lonely mindfuck battle that absolutely nobody gives a fuck about I ve wasted every opportunity I ve had and spend my time reading classic literature playing chess or watching TV in other words still avoiding figuring out how to make something of my life I was raised Catholic left the church but still remain sympathetic to the concept of Agape I don t know if many of you read but I cried for hours over Joyce s Ulysses which despite its many difficulties is simply about thus Love for others despite all of life s injustices Well even with all that I am consumed by loathing both for myself and for what s going on in my country right now guess which country I feel completely useless and want to leave Even the genius of a book like Joyce s Ulysses can t persuade me to stick around My mother has begun sending me drunk texts filled with misspelt apologies but I ve finally blocked them My dad and I have an OK relationship but it s still one defined by tragic misunderstanding and with years of recovery from drug abuse ahead of me it just seems like too much I don t foresee marriage I don t foresee career fulfillment Well that s my story I don t want to pay for a therapist so I needed to scream into a void somewhere If you ve read this far thank you,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

So why continue Ever since middle school I have wanted to commit suicide It s not gotten better I am in my final stretch of school at college I just want to end it My logic has shifted from I hate myself because I am an awful person who doesn t deserve to live to what s the point of living I figured it out I am just like everyone else We all have problems and we all have things we are good at and bad at That s fine There s no reason why I should hate myself But I do Every action I take causes me more sadness then happiness And the happiness I do attain never lasts more than a few days I ve tried medication and it makes everything worse Much worse What s the point of continuing on if the moments of happiness in life are drowned out by the sadness I feel of every day life I come into the world alone I go out alone I have a loving family amp caring friends I ve a bright future and I have almost a hundred grand to my name without so much as raising a finger to attain it I can t enjoy any of that Instead I focus on the fact that I can t enjoy it I focus on everything I do that s wrong regrettable past actions and why must I be hurtful towards anything I care about even if it s in jest I can be one of the nicest people and that s fine In fact I like making people happy because since I can t enjoy being happy at least I can window shop and watch your happiness What s the point of carrying on though It s as if everything I eat turns to ash The only reason I ve not killed myself just yet is because it s selfish and hurtful towards the people I care about I had a fairly disturbing thought process recently You always go out of your way for others Do something for yourself something you ve wanted since middle school Kill yourself I realize now that my preferred method for selfinflicted death is gunshot to the head Anything else would give me too much of a hesitation I have plenty to live for I don t want too I spend too much effort trying to accomplish my goals for things could make me happy I m tired of trying to be happy and failing constantly I can t make a moment of happiness last when I have an ocean of painful things to remember or harp on Even if it s not from that ocean I can look at other perspectives of my life and be disappointed in myself Ignoring the introspective causes of depression in my life another source is the complete meaningless of my life I work semi hard to attain certain goals and values and once completed the joy is rather limited but still existent However I am tired I am tired of work at the age of The rest of my life will be filled with nothing but work till I retire Wake up work sleep Repeat Why That s such a mind numbing task to endure for the rest of my for see able future It s definitely not something to look forward too I don t want to be alive if I am going to be forced to work for the rest of my life Fun fact I ve been commited to the hospital for self harm in fifth grade and have attempted suicide four times my last attempt being senior of highschool I used to cut myself I ve been put on antidepressants three times all with no real effect I was offered to moderate this place a while back I said no because this was gonna be hard to tell other people you should be alive when I didn t want to Of course the reason I gave MWM for my decline was that this place was far too depressing TL DR The emotions caused by the negatives of life outweigh the emotions by the positive So why carry on I want to stop putting effort into being alive It s far too much work and appears to have little to no pay off,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

no doubt in my mind that smoking pot plagued me with a lasting paranoia beyond the initial high or trip Say what you want about weed but the fact about it is that it can be very dangerous for some people It shattered my self esteem and I still feel like I am in constant danger At this same point in my life I was very isolated and depressed The most regretful part about this time is that I was self loathing and didn t realize how much opportunity around me there was to make positive changes In other words I was being a bitch about the life I had I am a lot better about this now and have no problem displaying positivity in front of others when I have the chance to do it I freeze up with nervousness in some social situations but I kicked the tendency to try to look sad for sympathy The subject of looking upset in front of others was not a completely new thing either Even as a little kid and teenager people would say to me things like what s wrong you look sad or you look like you are in physical pain what is going on or you need to smile more Also I have always had red watery eyes This led people to believe that I was stoned all the time even though I had never even seen weed until I started college I say this to explain that others have seen sadness or seriousness on my face when I am not trying to send off that energy and to transition into the beginning of the traumatic part At the job I had when I was self loathing I was purposefully looking down enough to the point where my coworkers thought I was actually crying I wasn t actually spilling tears because I had to work and didn t want to but I was figuratively crying about my life at work in front of others It took me awhile to figure out that people came to this conclusion but when I did I quit If I could choose a saying to apply to this it is definitely you got what you wished for I wanted people to see that I was sad and I got that in a way that was humiliating I was happy to be at work I really liked that job I had perfect attendance and took pride in my position with nerdiness Realizing that people thought I was crying over having to work made me panic to the point of having to hold back tears I let the opinion of others take control of me The next job I started was bussing tables I went into this job care free ready to forget my previous experience of regret and embarrassment I had already started to make an effort to act uplifted when I started working here Even when I felt comfortable and believed that I had picked a good gig because the restaurant speed and environment was enjoyable people thought I was crying over the work I swear I would feel totally calm and ask a customer if I could take a plate and they would be holding back laughter refusing to make eye contact with me When I realized this I became so self conscious about the way my face looked that almost every time a customer would ask me something I would feel like I was about to cry My face would twitch and my lip would quiver I never had tears streaming down my face at work but I would be on the verge of tears from the paranoia and panic This was an even more humiliating work experience for me because the public was there to witness and the town began to talk My reputation was completely stained with pathetic stories This same thing repeated with three jobs after this one After over three years since the problem first appeared there have been brighter times from then until now where the problem has not been fully surfaced in my every day life like it is now But it always creeps back in and pulls me down I still can not figure out if I looked so anxious and depressed that the appearance of my watery eyes led people to believe that I was crying What I do know is that I allowed it to push me over and become a reality Now it completely controls my life If I just talk to someone face to face it makes me want to cry Imagine just having someone ask you directions to a train station and becoming so overwhelmed with self consciousness that you begin to shake and tremble with a face about to weep When I walk down the street I feel like everyone will look at me and think I am crying So I always feel like I am about to do so It s not to the point of tears streaming down my face in public but it s everything that starts before that when anyone cries It s a cringed face quivering lower lip trembling etc I now live in NYC and just walking down the street is a horror Everyone on my street recognizes me as the young guy who you can see trying not to cry The delusional thoughts I have create the reality I can t think of anything more embarrassing for a twenty two year old male to be going through I am only still living because of the fear of hurting family and friends I would leave behind I think about jumping in front of the train a lot I go to a therapist once a week have tried multiple anxiety and depression medications currently tapering off Lamictal which makes everything a hell of a lot worse and the only thing that really helps are benzodiazepines Smoking weed definitely exaggerated panic in me and I believe this is why I am easily overcome with fear when people look at me A lot of the thoughts that would float through my brain during stoned contemplation would be self critical so I believe that those thoughts created an immense negative view of myself that I wrongly presumed people saw too It has been over two years since I bought weed but I have accepted hits every now and then Now I will completely refuse it because of the state of my brain To make matters worse I have used cocaine a little bit It was never an addiction but just an unhealthy choice I made several times which obviously did not help with paranoia Before I started getting high I was a bright kid and handled conflict well with my first job I knew how to handle customers yelling at me I would appreciate any stories of overcoming serious paranoia or advice on treatments that I may not know about I am trying to find some kind of practical coping method Thanks for reading a post this long edit I am new to reddit so any subs you think I should transfer this to would be

"I started seeing my pdoc in fall of 2012. Around this time, I went into the hospital for suicidal ideation. Little medication change, things were pretty good until spring of 2014. I relapsed hard, purging, cutting, not going to classes. 
 My therapist asked me to start coming in 2x a week, which didn't help and just cost me a ton of money. My pdoc upped me to the maximum dosage of my antidepressant. This really messed me up and I completely broke down and had to go home for the semester.
 I returned last fall, feeling much better after seeing a good therapist in my hometown and switching medications. I was doing pretty well. 
 But for the past month or so, I've been having symptoms that I've never really had before. I can hardly sleep, I can't focus (it takes me forever to read a news article) and I just feel anxious and overstimulated all the time. 
 I saw my pdoc this morning for a regular appointment, but made some of this new stuff clear on my intake sheet. He brushed it all off as stress (I'm working about 25 hours a week this semester.) 
 I feel like saying more would be pushy. I just think that after three years, he's not going to be open to looking into yet another diagnosis. It feels so stagnant. Our appointments are 10 minutes, tops.
 Maybe it is just stress, but I just don't know how to approach this.",['Miscellaneous'],low

"So, a little background. I'm a 23 year old male with a BS in physics and applied math. So I'm somewhat intelligent (this is relevant). About a month ago, I saw an article on reddit (can't remember the sub) about a doctor who was helping people with an issue that seemed similar to what I'm experiencing. The best way that I can describe it with how the article described it, is that you come to a conclusion on something that *could* happen (or start thinking about *why* something happened in the past the way it did), and you basically go on a logic train to hell, where you follow a bunch of illogical conclusions that build up into a horribly unrealistic scenario. However, if someone asks about how you got to the scenario, they can see your logic that brought you to that last conclusion because they can follow your logic even though the logic is unrealistic. The problem is I can't for the life of me think of what the disease is called.
 
 On the topic of the intelligence part, the article talked about the doctor having to use techniques for this one patient because he was intelligent and the normal treatment wouldn't really work with him. Basically he could see past simple logic problems, but not advanced ones. I think this is where I'm at right now.

So I ve been exercising in I think the most unhealthy I can So at just the start no I don t use drugs or steroids or have anorexia I m talking mentally so with that outta the way let s get on with it P S info for the story I m competitive year and I have a long distance girlfriend I ve been with for almost months and I use way too many commas so please forgive me So I m British and my school is right next to the Thames this means we rowing as a sport Throughout year and I always wanted to row so when year rolled around and I was finally the minimum age I could be I jumped right into it I was never an athletic kid hell no I wasn t fat I was unpopular not stand out and to put it simply below average in grades physically and probably in terms of mental health too I was very unpopular being the first kid to hit puberty at to so I was taller than others but still physically very unfit Now one thing that got me into rowing was that fact I was tall At I was approaching foot and fast One thing they don t tell you about ergo machines is that height matters A LOT I instantly got one of the best scores in the year and then it began I was launched from the background right into the spotlight I was suddenly madly competitive and mildly popular and I wanted to be the best So I was Throughout all of year nine I ground my body as hard as I could to have the body I wanted Our year was also the year where the Thames was overflowing our dock quite a bit we had about sessions in the entire year on the water the rest on the machines My body was exhausted but I wasn t eventually nearing the end of the year I managed to pull a split on metres This was a BIG deal I d beat my goal I beat metres in less than seconds to be exact My first ever time took seconds over a fifth higher I was the top of the leaderboard all day every day and my confidence showed it I felt like a king Then Covid happened Immediately I had a problem my gym wouldn t let me in even with no lockdown cause I m under and I had no ergo so we had to get one A concept was preferred as it s industry standard Cut weeks into the future and I ve nearly lost quid of my dad s money to a scam of a concept but i have the new RW NordickTrack Rowing Machine delivered by the lovely Amazon Good Great I was back But then Covid stayed my motivation slipped and I became lazy I was a tragedy if you ever saw one I was doing barely anything and my body was paying for it I was slipping from day to day of online school feeling awful and having my body go down in quality all the while But I got on with it I got back into it and I pushed my body past my limit until I got back So I feel great going back I grin to my friends as I mount the ergo and prepare to brake another of my records at the front of the pack in my arena I felt unstoppable My score was below average pitiful considering how i was and way below what I wanted expected and needed to be in the top boat By now the sport consumed me but rejected me I was getting mediocre scores and everyone else was soaring Cut about a month and I m kicked from top boat Just realized writing this forgot to say I was a year when I came back and we had a new coach she hates me She kicks me from top boat and I m crushed shaking from disappointment in myself and suddenly I m pushed back into the background I didn t matter once again I was paired with the people who wouldn t focus but in boats with people never having rowed before Wanna know the worst bit I could see the top boat speeding away from us any time I looked to my right we were finally on the river and this is how it was Now we re in lockdown again and I m determined I can t let that happen again or so I think right before I get on the ergo once more and feel a painful rash spread across my whole body So it turns out for a few months I ve had a condition where whenever my blood gets to hot or something that s when it effects me worst I break out into a rash I was struggling once more thinking it was just hayfever I struggled through each session it got worse and worse I now have medication an antihistamine to be exact fexofenadine hydrochloride to stop it Great back to it So my school is private and most of the kids have mansions and one guy I know has a gym the size of most of my house so I m at a disadvantage competitively and I ve been doing this for one and a half years when these people have been swimming competitively in their pools for most of their lives But I got too it and I m getting better with my body and I m getting better scores until there it is my name My name in gold I got the fastest score for a kilometre race in the year Remember how I said Concept s are industry standard Well that means my coach who once again dislikes me had to change my scores to be accurate To do this I sent her my average watts produced per metres a measurement which adds with to my score in a concept conversion to per metres and I did it in the km this doesn t add up if you check since it s just an average watt count but the timer didn t lie I d done it This did not matter A split second in a race does And so does my split score As I said before I beat in seconds My coach added seconds to every split I did from my home ergo and my name was wiped from the leaderboard no matter what the watt count said I was pushed forced back down I went from the best score to one of the worst Now seconds is a LOT of time and that s for each metres so instead of my original score I was forced to put up with a score of seconds slower than the original So now what do I know I can t beat anything at home now I can simply train my body for when I go back to be best again The seconds thing was weeks ago about As I mentioned I have a girlfriend she s incredible we don t see each other much and we mostly text and she was getting concerned about the strain I ve been putting on my body But I ve been insecure about everything for too long I can t handle not getting back up there I need it I crave it I was born to row I know it So I ve been doing the worst thing I can I ve lied to her Multiple times I say I m going to bed but I stay up going as hard as I physically can no longer bound by my condition Even as I write this it s AM and she thought I went to sleep at I need help I can t stop I can t keep doing this to her I feel terrible My body is sore and aching and I can t lie to her anymore it s awful I need suggestions on what to do I can t put her through me complaining more and more I can t stay down in rowing and I need to get back up I m ready to row again

I don t see the point in going on like this Hello I would like some advices about what I should do I am almost male My parents divorced when I was years old and I had to live with my mother we didn t really get along but she was the only person I had so we both made an efort and it worked for some time But for the last years we had many fights and things weren t the same I didn t feel safe loved protected Now I moved with my father in Belgium I m from Romania thinking that it will be better My dad already had a new family here a girlfriend which had children they had been together for about a year and a half I tought everything is good here a stable family and it had been like this for a couple of months but now my father started drinking very much every week fights are always happening but a couple of nights ago he took it too far He told me go to buy him more alcohol at midnight I said him that he should stop drinking and that is too cold outside to go now everyone was sleeping and I didn t want to wake up them by going to search clothes money etc and he started screaming at me He dragged me outside in a t shirt and shorts there where like degrees C and I had problems before because of going out in the cold without proper clothes I suffered from sinusitis and would be fainting a couple of times a day I had to stay in hospital for some time because of this He managed to wake up everyone and they didn t take it too well that he forced me to buy alcohol in this situation And after this argument he broke up with her I really liked her my brother and sister but now he is jobless and we got to find a new place to live I ve had a couple of attempts before I tried cutting pills and I think it would be easier to take it that way Right now I can t go back to my mother and here I don t think I can do it with him drinking all the time I can give you a little backstory about what happened before that made me try it but it hurts real bad so I would rather avoid it if possible Thank you in anticipation for all the help,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Irreversible problemIn general I ve had an alright life I ve got friends I m generally liked by those who take the time to get to know me I have a supportive mother and family I became successful in a career I wanted to pursue from just my own enthusiasm fincally alright off and I had a loving caring and stunningly beautiful girlfriend who I shared so much in common and wanted to spend my life with as did she Everything changed when my girlfriend took her life During our two year relationship she d been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder I tried to get her support and help and in ways she seemed to be getting better The problems certainly put a strain on our relationship and left me emotionally and mentally exhausted at times but I stuck by her because she was worth it Among the many reasons she may have taken her life I know she was very scared about me being away for a new contract as I d been gone for the weekdays and even with me trying to reassure her I believe her abandonment issues overwhelmed her Since it happened everything has just spiralled Her mother blamed me and started to spread lies about me resulting in people turning against me It s put immense strain on my relationship with my mother as she witnesses me lose my will to live I had to leave the job as I could no longer face it and lost all passion for the career I once enjoyed so much The main thing above all else is how I ve lost her and I can t fathom or face a life without her She was just too special too loving too beautiful and no one will ever live up to her I feel like I failed her by moving away and none of this would ve happened had I just stayed I m I ve spent most of my adult life single due to my crippling shyness and anxeity It was almost a mircale that a girl like her was interested in a guy like me and I feel in ways I blew it for not making her feel more special and taking her for granted It s been over half a year since it happened and I m just getting worse Even with therapy grief counselling medication and endless research I m not improving I won t meet another and even if somehow I did they would never compare I don t really want to die but again I can t face a reality without her I find myself spending more time now just getting ready to end it getting the confidence to do it I get no joy from anything I just cry and spend all day in bed Not even sure why posting this I guess it s just somewhere to vent,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Apathetic towards life Basically I m going through an intense existential crisis Can t sleep because I m thinking constantly about the meaningless and futility of human existence and the fact that nothing that humans treasure in this world actually means anything to me and that I would be equally as fulfilled spending the rest of my life in a small room living on bowls of rice as I would living the mundane life of the average American forming superficial relationships with other and climbing the corporate ladder until I either save up enough money to retire and play bingo with other dying people buy a beachfront property like one of those snooty rich white people you see on HGTV or be like the average american and work until I meet my inevitable death Even if I become a doctor the lives I save are going to end anyway Even if I become a politician whatever country I try to save is going to crumble eventually anyway Even if I become a writer my words will be lost someday and one day every trace of humanity s existence will be wiped out and forgotten Literally the only thing I can think of that I would dream of doing would be to travel the world and see as much of it as I can but even the excitement of that is being stamped out by the constant overflowing of information on the internet about the world Why save a shit ton of money to travel to Japan when you could go online and look at pictures read travel blogs listen to their music on youtube do a bunch of other stuff that effectively would ruin the excitement of your life experience There are so many people better of than you that you can just live vicariously through and even if you don t frequent the internet very often you re still bound to at some point feel like you re experiencing some form of sensory overload with the media constantly in you face all the goddamn time Everything just feels like it s already been said and done and I m pretty honestly bored with life,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

How I feel The story I m not like most people I m special Special doesn t mean better It doesn t mean worse Only different At first sight I look normal I act normal But I did figure out that I wasn t and it only took me two decades So my situation s a little different than others here I didn t live through a traumatic event when I was a kid according to me My parents didn t beat me Didn t get bullied too much I m not in pain I don t feel alone even though I am I didn t have a best friend when I was a kid It wasn t a health problem so I didn t talk about it to my physician And when I felt anxious well everyone else did too Nothing strange there either a kid was stressed or didn t give a shit I talked about my feelings just as much as the next guy which is not at all I could be wrong there since I didn t have a best friend It all seemed pretty normal to me It was pretty normal to be stressed and to not give a shit And I could do both Fast forward a little and it becomes obvious that I m not normal In my early twenties my friends were my co workers I had started smoking to cope with the stress Random people had earned my respect for coping with stress without that crutch Going out once a month is definitely not normal Not having friends is not normal Not seeing your parents for months in a row is not normal It made me different Not better not worse I had already thought about killing myself briefly During I kid you not an insurance meeting with the HR department She did the math in front of me not exactly challenging I had to work another something years to get full retirement benefits At the time I thought I could do it I was let go about years later I didn t think about my mental health issues for some time Eventually I did my own research to find out relevant details I m reasonably certain that I also have alexithymia lack of emotional self awareness and anhedonia inability to feel pleasure It s always easier to spot a problem in retrospect but it explains a lot Why I don t miss people when they re gone Why I don t cry at funerals Why I rarely get angry Why I never knew what to ask for on my birthdays I don t form emotional bond with people There s no one in my life to whom I can say with certainty I love you A blank space is a list of every thing I want My whole life has been driven by what I don t want I don t want to stand out I don t want to be unemployed I don t want to be homeless I don t want to live I don t want to walk around aimlessly choc full of antidepressant Don t want to work years in a daze Don t want to get stuck in a psych ward Don t want to get worse Things aren t bad for me They re not good either I can t remember the best day of my life Can t remember the worst either But I do remember some bad ones I don t want to kill myself but I think I ll do it anyway,"['Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

Consideration and thoughtHey Reddit I don t know how to really start this for my first post but hopefully you will bear with me and I hopefully at some point I ll be able to share my thoughts and feelings and people can empathize with me I m pretty much going to be throwing out my thoughts and I may sound strange at times so please forgive me if that happens I am suicidal It s not a continuous thing where I think about it non stop but I do get the thoughts often Some might look at me and think that I d have a pretty decent life and that there s nothing wrong with it I have friends who love me a family that cares about me sometimes and I guess I couldn t really pinpoint why I am suicidal I have been to the doctor for help after years of self diagnosis with depression I was not in the state of being too proud to ask for help but I was worried about being criticized by my family members I d often think about suicide and ways I could do it My main thought processes are Hanging myself I can t tie knots so this isn t really viable for me Drowning I have a morbid fear of water Jumping from a great height I also have a fear of heights I have never talked to anyone about this before apart from my doctor It took me a LOT of courage to visit the doctor Like I said earlier it took me about years to actually ask for help I think the main problem for me if you can call it a problem is that I d want to commit suicide but I can t find it in me to take my own life People might think it s a good thing that I m still here but for me it is an never ending battle with myself Whenever I have these thoughts I also think of how people would react to me successfully committing suicide I can imagine that they would feel bad obviously I think it s another reason why I can t do it I can give a lot to my friends and I am a rather selfless person I love my friends more than I love myself and I would do anything to make the ones I love happy I d walk on hot coals or broken glass or I d run into moving traffic just so my friend would smile They definitely wouldn t smile if I ran into traffic and died but this is my problem I suppose I don t want to be here but there are a few things in the way The doctor put me on a month waiting lost for a counselor and I ve been prescribed anti depressants My mother doesn t want me to take them because she believes that I will become dependant on them and she thinks I will turn out like a zombie I also asked one of my uncles and he described depression as a difficult thing He said it s all about training your mind to be positive For me that is very difficult and I didn t even think of bringing suicide up to him In honesty I don t think it s fair to tell anyone that I m suicidal I m only here writing this in the hope that I will find some relief Maybe I will I think the one true relief for me is suicide When I went for help my family members reacted negatively There was no praise in finding help which is understandable seeing as most of the time family members do not understand depression and suicide etc Friends might but in my eyes family doesn t My brother said I was lying to the doctor about how I feel which isn t true If I was crying and sighing non stop and I breathed deeply left the house and went to the doctor for what I thought was an emergency I needed the help While I wouldn t say I truly recieved help it was a weight that was lifted to find that my illness was recognised I was diagnosed with major depression anxiety and seasonal affective disorder at the start of this month I guess I really don t have a point to this because I m not really asking for help directly but it is a little better for me knowing I can speak to a wider audience about how I feel Suicidal thoughts for me are still ongoing everyday I am very very scared though as to if I ll go through with it Thank you for reading if you have I appreciate it,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I m so tired and I m stuck and I m guilty and everything hurts I really didn t expect to make it to and I don t want to drag myself further on through time Idk I don t mean to be a giant crybaby and complain because I know other people go through so much more and are so strong and life is so difficult even though I never do anything and I m useless I feel so guilty and I just want to cry all the time because everyone around me loves me or at least a caring sort of pity and I know they care but they overestimate me and I feel so guilty My dad is amazing and he deserves a daughter that isn t so dumb and annoying and helpless He deserves a daughter who isn t just a giant drain and I feel so bad I wish I could apologize to him and my mom and everyone else who has put effort into me I don t deserve it Every time people have expressed I have a bright future or offer some kind of reference to my future I want to cry and tell them I can t I can t do it anymore and I don t have the energy to and I m sorry but I won t last that long I m so tired I know I should exercise and eat better and I want to I know I need to practice my DBT skills and go out and start being independent and I can t And I m torn between ending it because I don t want my dad and stepmom to put any more money or effort into trying to help me they deserve to spend it on themselves and nice things not a disgusting slug And I know I m not actually disgusting or a slug but I still feel awful I rationally understand and get all the things I think are black and white and my emotions steam roll me I just want to lie down on the ground and cry for a really long time and then just fade out of existence I m scared of pain And I cry and feel bad when I think about hurting my mom and my family if I kill myself and I love my pets and they need me to take care of them and they also deserve a better caretaker I don t want to leave anyone behind but I can t bear it I m stuck in limbo I feel horrendous everyday but I m too much of a stupid wimp to really end it And I m scared of dying but I can t go on And my psychiatrist diagnosed me and I looked up what I have and it s chronic I can t live like this I can t spend my years on this earth feeling this way I don t know I feel bad for complaining I know this is what this subreddit is for but I still feel guilty for dumping this on anyone who reads it I just feel like the next time I have a bad episode I ll really do something I can t change and I just idk about anything anymore,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

My th birthday is tomorrow and I can t stop thinking of committing suicideI ll try to make this as short as I can But long story short I left an abusive relationship left town and left all my friends I was about to start nursing school on one day when everything hit the fan and I packed my bags and left Now I m back with my parents since October For the third time I ve been through several relationships that have went down hill and have caused me trauma Now I m with a guy who is genuinely a good guy I do love him but he has mental issues of his own and all my issues are weighing him down I have physical health issues on top of depression anxiety and ptsd I can t hold a job I keep trying and failing If it s not my Health acting up it s my anxiety or depression that s so bad I can t even bring my self to leave my bed That s not what I want I m thinking of trying for disability but I feel like I m just making excuses and don t deserve it I just lost my job after weeks of having it and months of finding it I told my boyfriend they fired me for being a liability which has happened in the past but the truth is I walked out after having a bad situation with my health and getting sick at work I felt embarrassed and felt like they were gonna fire me anyways I know I should of stuck it out But I didn t I was about to move in with him things were about to get good My parents don t even know I lost my job They think I was going to move out this weekend but my boyfriend told me he wants me to prove I can hold a job because he s in no position to take Care of me he can not mentally handle it He told me he s not happy and his anxiety is sky high because of all the pressure he s under He told me he does love me and wants this to work but he feels like I m not trying The thing is I can t tell if I m trying or not Some days I feel like I am then others I can t make proper adult decisions because I d rather just lay in bed and pretend not to exist I feel like such a burden to my family and my boyfriend I feel like I m ruining something that could of potentially been good I feel as if the world might be better off with out me Monday is my birthday and I keep getting this intrusive thought over and over that maybe it s time for me to go I can easily make it look like natural causes because of my health situation and die in my sleep I don t feel like I m capable of living a normal life I ve tried therapy didn t help I m on a high dose of Prozac which did help at one point but not lately I just feel so lost,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

How on Earth do I get past this I suffer from anxiety and undiagnosed depression and I will explain more about my undiagnosed depression down below Onto my confession For a while I have been having horrible depression days and a whole bunch of suicidal thoughts My thoughts range from extremely graphic to somewhat peaceful I ve even researched the perfect ways to die and what not to do Of course I do not want to give anyone else ideas on how to end their own lives but that is just a thing that calms me down and makes me calm down and look at possible options to make it quick and painless for both me and possibly the crime scene cleaners I do live with my parents and I definitely struggle with all the questions people do not usually think of once they died I have to go away from myself and look at what others might experience Who would find the body How much of a mess would I make if I do decide to end it early What would people think afterwards Would my current image to others change due to me killing myself and having them know I was depressed How would I explain everything while still keeping a good image of myself to others How would I make it easier to help my family move on and help them grieve when they need to While I put away everything I own who should I write it for Should I clean everything so it wouldn t be a burden for others Should I place everything I own in storage boxes so they can throw out everything that they do not want or need anymore Should I record my voice and turn it into a CD saying all their names and how much I love them Or should I just end it suddenly with no explanation so they don t know how dark my mind was when I was alive I don t plan on really going through with it currently due to the questions stated earlier I would never want my mom or dad ever finding my body that would break any parent for finding their child s body Honestly I really really need help but I can t afford to ruin my current image to others I can t get help myself because I am under and I need a parent or guardian to sign off on my treatment and I don t want them to have to pay for my care I can t just tell them because they would worry and reflect on themselves to see if they did anything wrong which they did not and they would never look at me the same way after If I told my psychiatrist she would be worried about me again and tell my parents who would again worry and be stressed about me The nearest psychiatric hospital is apparently not very good and has a large history of r pe and the hospital is not very sanitary The staff are also reported as not caring or being rude to the patients My depression has been very tough on me and I am too scared to tell my psychiatrist or parents that I may need antidepressants because I again fear them not looking at me the same afterwards Also there would be several uncomfortable questions and I don t want my parents to worry about me more than they already do I have already caused enough stress for my parents with my anxiety and quiting public school and going to an online school in which I am severely behind on due to not being motivated and stressed when my parents constantly tell me to do my work and just get over it It s very stressful and I have breakdowns a lot but I do it in secret because my mom tell me that s life and suck it up I only tell my mom what s wrong with me because my dad is quite hard to talk to about mental health because he doesn t understand But my mom is starting to get at the end of her rope with me and starting to get angry if I tell her I had a panic attack or cry in front of her It definitely makes me feel closed in and I am afraid to tell her these things now because she gets frustrated with me and blames me as her defense She has a habit of blaming me as her defense mechanism and I take what she says to heart and use that to constantly critize myself I am my biggest critic and so is my mom For a time after I was diagnosed she was more gentile and showed more empathy with me but over the years since that she has became more frustrated with me I ve been lying on my schoolwork and tell her I do it when in reality I cry and sleep to get away from it all She constantly calls and texts me to see if I m doing my schoolwork and I tell her yes and I cry after the call because I am so behind and so stressed that I might have to redo my sophomore year of high school and that terrifies me I already have to go back in January and I will have to overlap some of my current schoolwork just to get enough credits for sophomore year I can t tell her this because she will get frustrated with me and most likely take my computer away which I use constantly to get the thoughts away I always have to have music or YouTube going just to not think about everything that I have to do and even then it doesn t help When I try and do the schoolwork I become overwhelmed and cry I play the sims to get away from everything and my mom is constantly telling me to do work she wants me to do school work for over hours when she s home I can t focus and I want to end it but I can t with all the liabilities I just want it to end and not be stressed about school or life,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

At war with my self sabotageHi I was diagnosed with depression years ago My abusive family didn t care about my meds so I had to be reanimated after suicide attempt as a teenager As an adult I endured being homeless twice years then a few months progressing disability sight loss suspicion of MS chronic pain and other constant lack of money selling myself for a place to live a year when I stayed in bed for days skipping showers and food I managed to finish school after years of dropping out I became homeless while still attending high school and even got accepted at uni our schools are free I did my best to follow meds and therapy plans worked on myself and my reactions tried to be more open to people After ten years of hard mental work I finally can notice and name my emotions see that not choosing is still a choice and understand how my head works All my friends say I ve changed a lot and for better Yet I have a new crisis For last year I ve been slowly ruining my education by skipping classes and not using opportunities created by pretty decent uni authorities I m stuck in therapy because I can t make any further progress until I force myself to do something change something It feels almost physical when I try to shove myself into sticking with my own plans even though they re not big ones I tried to get a part time job to get back on job hunting market but I had to quit it after damaging my sight even more Right now I m at the verge of becoming homeless again got kicked out of the uni and with no money for most meds I already asked my friends to pay some bills and meds for me and I don t want to ask too often I see how my self destructive part gains more and more power over the reasonable one however I still can see how ridiculous it is I m really afraid that after two years with no serious suicide thoughts I ll do something irreversible I also get urges to cut my arms which I hadn t done for almost years I feel safer when doing nothing even though I know it s way more dangerous Today I cried in the middle of street because I can t take this amount of stress anymore How does one force themselves to act How to motivate yourself to fight I m sure I want to live but I m also sure I m not able to live this way anymore Suicide seems like bad decision but the only one which can give me some peace I see it like a tooth removal you don t want to get rid of your teeth but it s so damaged it s the only way to get rid of pain,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

My late diagnose of autism ruined my youth my parents tried to hide my autism I just can t accept it I suffered a lot of injustice I was diagnosed with autism when I was before I just wasn t myself The primary school was okay I was still able to function fairly socially and I had quite a few friends I was almost never bullied High school was hell I did not have any friends and you could see on my face that I was very bothered by the environment I always looked angry I could not function at all socially people became angry frustrated with me because having a conversation was not really going and never could dared to say something in class and thus became a target of bullying People wondered several times what was wrong with me but I didn t know it myself but it was my autism The last years of high school I was completely isolated from the rest and severely depressed social just did not work at all People were walking over me I was quite anxious at school As I describe it living with autism without knowing it is like you are using a device without knowing how to use it because you miss the user manual and i was kind of like a zombie By the way I did finish school At My follow up education I also had no friends and it was a repetition exercise but even worse not much difference was also bullied And when I was done with that I was at home for a year I didn t want anything Then I talked to the doctor who had me diagnosed for autism through someone And then all the puzzle pieces fell into place it feels like I ve missed a part of my life My parents also tried my whole life hiding my autism because my mom was ashamed that she had another child whith autism my older brother was diagnosed at the age of My parents never talked about autism so I did not know anything about it My dad also has autisme but he refuses to give in he knew at a late age he had autism He wanted the same thing happen to him with me he also screamed a lot at me and beaten me up a lot as a kid I am so down depressed,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
here it goes againI m I ve been depressed most of the time since I was I ve arguably had anxiety since the day I was born A few years ago I was also diagnosed with autism I don t connect with people no matter how I try I m tired of trying Therefore I m alone The suicidal thoughts have been growing in intensity for nearly a year I think save last month when I got a reprieve for a few weeks But they re back now and I can feel myself sliding right back to where I was I ve been through everything exercise diet changes therapy groups individual therapy partial hospitalization inpatient hospitalization and nearly every combination of medications that a psychiatrist is willing to throw at me I m used to things being bad during time periods where I wasn t getting treatment I ve been scared and hopeless because I ve now gotten worse than ever while being treated I m scared that this is as good as it gets for me that the darkness is just going to keep getting even darker somehow If that s the case then suicide is an inevitability Fighting this hard to still feel this bad is exhausting and futile Somewhere deep down I know my life is worth the fight but it s harder and harder to remember,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Need some help in MS LA I m male and I live around the Mississippi Lousiana border near Slidell and I don t know what to do really To start off I ve had minor depression issues on and off for years but this year it culminated in me actually needing to get meds to help control it same with anxiety I ve been on the meds for months and I m in worse shape than in January Recently it s become amplified infinitely due to my wife out of the blue wanting to split up due to a few mishaps in our relationship over the years I was completely blindsided by this and she refuses to talk it over do couples therapy I m addicted to her and we ve been together since mid before I turned and we have kids together who live with us were adopted out early on in our relationship Due to all this I ve been at wits end considering downing every bottle of pills I can find and even had the cops and e squad called on me earlier this week and I lied to them about me bordering on taking all the pills or not I don t even want to be in this shape due to my kids It pains me enough just to sit alone bawling my eyes out and having to tell my kids to give me a few minutes I saw a counselor on Monday and she said that I need to work on myself and throughout my life I ve been told I m too self centered so I have a hard time even doing things for myself anymore and for psychiatric help I was told the two closest places earliest I could get in would be three and five months I ve been teetering on self committment but I m worried that something like that could be leveraged against me to keep me from seeing my kids in the future Does anyone know of any psychiatric facilities that won t have me waiting a large portion of a year to be seen,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high
I ve set a date to dieI guess a little background first might be useful I m I ve suffered from depression pretty much constantly since I was and I probably was depressed long before actually being diagnosed In the last few years I ve started different courses at university all of which I ve ended up having to drop out of because I couldn t handle the workload and my depression would get really bad this leaves me feeling really worthless particularly when I see all my peers beginning to start careers I ve never had a girlfriend probably largely due to my lack of confidence not that I would end my life over something so petty but it contributes to my feeling of worthlessness The girl I ve liked for the past few years already has a boyfriend which would be easier to deal with if he wasn t a complete jerk and practically the opposite of me eg overflowing with confidence doesn t really give a shit about anyone but himself A few months ago I decided to tell her how I felt despite this not intending to interfere with her relationship mainly just thinking it might help me move on which it didn t unfortunately I did this through facebook as I couldn t get a chance to speak to her alone and even though she didn t seem to think less of me for it I ve regretted doing that ever since On top of that I really don t have any friends and never really have only people who are friends in certain situations never really inviting me anywhere or socializing outside of those situations whereas I have tried to do that so I m constantly feeling alone and feeling like I don t belong anywhere So I ve planned a date to kill myself Like most people I don t actually want to die but I can t keep going like I have been and I ve run out of options in fact part of the reason I decided to set a date was to hopefully change my mind and make myself less likely to do something impulsively and I even decided on several things that if they happened I wouldn t kill myself but I realize now those things aren t likely to happen between now and then I was trying to decide between dates one of which was today but ended up deciding on the later date because it gives me the chance to do things I want to do first I don t really know what I expect to get out of this I ve already tried so much and seen several counsellors psychologists and psychiatrists and I ve improved a bit but I don t know how to keep going any more anyway I figure it can t hurt to post here,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

just at a loss So I m at a point where things in my life just seem to be way too ridiculous for me to make any sense of or control I am m and here s some backstory grew up well off but with a case of undiagnosed depression and one of those families that never owned up to just how dysfunctional it really was It was my senior year of high school when all the previously ignored shit finally hit the the proverbial fan though My father lost his job and my parents decided to split My family now just my mother me and two sisters went from living a living a comfortable lifestyle to just making ends meet We moved to a tiny house and my mom was forced to find a job to keep us afloat All throughout this process my depression and anxiety issues start coming to a head I would go to school and just have panic attacks and either just walk around the place aimlessly in a weird haze or skip school altogether to drink or do drugs Eventually I dropped out Ever since then things just got worse and worse I started getting into more serious drugs until I started using strong painkillers and heroin My mother kicked me out and I was forced to move in with my father who sort of lived with his friend My first night there he explains the reason for the divorce was that he explained to my mother that he was in fact a gay man and he couldn t go on living a lie I guess While it made sense and I WAS extremely sympathetic to his coming out I couldn t help but feel alienated and weirded out Also I never really had a great relationship with him in the first place He was never the typical dad and also had his bouts with alcoholism here and there and I honestly didn t really like him for that even in spite of viewing everything now through the lens of his coming out At this point I realized how depressed I was feeling really suicidal daily but I was able to curtail the self abusive thoughts through drugs and alcohol I just sort of did not give a fuck about anything anymore I guess I wasn t in school and couldn t hold down a job and this developed into tension between me my father and his friend Eventually we almost got into physical altercation so I peaced the fuck out of there and went from house to house living with my cousin and other relatives and eventually some girl I was sleeping with at the time One day my ex girlfriend got really concerned because of my depression and drug use and coerced me to check myself into the psych ward at a hospital I did I spend around a week there and they discharge me with an antidepressant perscription I continue to live with said girl whose family actually turns out to be really cool and supportive and things really start to improve for me mental health wise as I stay on the Zoloft I eventually land a job at a pizzeria so my mother decides it s cool if I come back home providing I pay rent I m psyched and things are pretty cool for a while I quit hard drugs and stop hanging out with wasteoids But my medication runs out after a month and I don t have health insurance cause we re poor now Anxiety comes back tenfold and I just cant take working at the stressful pizzeria anymore so I stop showing up I try to explain to my mother what s up with my depression and anxiety but she just doesnt get it and thinks I m a wimp She finally agrees to pay out of pocket for a psych appointment so I can get new perscriptions but does so grudgingly and always uses that to sort of hold over my head This was about a month ago My medication is about to run out again and I still cant find a new job Everyday my mother comes home from work pissed and apparently now I have until the second of November to give her rent money or she ll drop me off at the social services building She doesnt fuck around It s been months but I m starting to feel real self loathing again and I feel like the only option I really have is to just sorta check out or get into hard drugs again I realize that was a lot to read and yeah it does seem like the plot to a bad coming of age tale kind of thing or some shit but this is what s up for me right now I figured I d try to bounce this off of some complete strangers to see if there are any suggestions solutions to my bullshit other than self harm Anything in response is both unexpected and appreciated So yeah,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"I am doing HORRIBLE. I can't stop thinking about my fp. It's been nearly two weeks since he has messaged me. What did I do?
 
 The last time we hung out, I subtly described to him that he's my favorite person. I didn't use any bpd terms, but I just sort of told him how much I appreciate and admire him, and how I find myself relying on him and being dependent on him often.
 He didn't seem weirded out, he even reciprocated a bit. He told me stuff like ""I love hanging out with you too."" ""I love being friends too.""
 He told me that... so why? Why is he ignoring me?
 CW: self harm ideation
 
  It hurts so badly, it hurts so badly I've been wanting to cut to just make the pain physical.
 I don't understand why he would say such sweet and nice things to me and immediately ignore me for 2 weeks.
 
 I've been telling myself over and over how much I hate him and how much I want to cut him out completely.
 But it's not true...I really don't want to cut him out. I want to stay friends and I want to be someone he can rely on too.
 I'm IN LOVE with him. I love him so much it hurts me every day because I can never have him and I'm wasting my time.
 
 I'm kept up at night thinking about what I might have done wrong.
 I might have scared him away? Maybe he didn't mean all those nice things he said, he must have only said them to quell me.
 
 I honestly would rather he tell me he thinks I'm a freak and that he never wants to speak to me again...instead of doing whatever this is.

Therapist told me not to call anymoreSo it s been years and counting of continually worsening depression I finally started seeing a therapist I really like and feel like I work well with about months ago I d say it took about two before I really felt like things clicked in and I wasn t so intimidated by the professional environment I am not at all the type who easily shares with others out of a combo of crippling shyness realizing others don t really know what to do say care etc so I basically have always been alone in my struggles I have an emotionally abusive mother and while my dad and I are on fine terms we re not super close I don t really have any friends to vent to as not many really know I have issues and regardless as mentioned previously they never know what to do or say and can t babysit me a year old Anyways after a few months my therapist said I could start calling her I felt so guilty every time I did because I hated the idea of being a burden and forcing her to take work home with her as who likes that I knew I was possibly overdoing it admittedly I was only doing it maybe a third of the times I ve felt super suicidal over the last few months but unfortunately I feel quite suicidal very often with this event surely worsening that Anyways today at our session she gave me her business card and said this is the best number to reach me on Like First of all I really hated how passive aggressive that was I would have MUCH preferred her telling me that I was calling too much and us discussing that Secondly there is no way anyone could ever believe that her office number is her best number as she s only in her office days so there would be no way to get in touch past pm when she leaves or on a weekend or the one day a week she starts in the afternoon Anyways now I feel super awkward and uncomfortable I knew this had to be coming but at the same time prayed it wouldn t and also really hated the way this happened as I would have preferred a confrontation This really made me panic because I honest to god have no one to talk to EVER in dire moments and honestly just worsened suicidal thoughts And now I feel like a huge step back has been taken in my comfort level as previously mentioned I do not open up well at all and I feel like this has just set me back on that exponentially harder as now I feel more like I am sitting in a job interview meeting with a teacher or employer etc than a therapy session In fact this really has made me never ever want to call her again on any phone number or use email to do anything but discuss scheduling matters I have a session tomorrow and honestly just want to cancel the one I have on Monday which is the first time I ve ever not wanted to go to therapy I just feel like I got punched in the stomach or something Anyways anyone have any input thoughts advice Thanks,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

But I don’t want to be here. And the weird times she does text me, I really don’t even want to talk to her. Not even because of the texting thing, but just because I don’t care about her being in my life.

"I have every single symptom except I’ve never cut myself or had an unsuccessful attempt. I have had real suicidal thoughts a lot though and one day I literally spent so long looking up methods and wanted to use my dad’s belt to hang me. That night we had family friends over and I was in tears. It truly felt like I might have gone through it that day. When you tell others these things though you seem like an attention seeker and part of me thinks I did want attention, in fact that’s what I needed the most. 
 
 I was alone with my parents at home during covid and they completely neglect me. They do enough to make themselves feel like good parents but I felt completely invisible. So I have some sympathy for the attention seekers at times because maybe they were just constantly ignored. 
 
 That day I actually told my mom what I wanted to do and I actually felt truly loved. She told me that my life means more than anything to her but that love was temporary. Next day it’s as if none of that happened and most of the time they don’t show me that love unless I act dramatic. They don’t give me the words I need to hear unless I become super dramatic.

Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys I am in a tough place right now Quick background on me I have moderate severe clinical depression Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time I self harmed every day My symptoms are completely managed by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts I just started dating someone trans nonbinary assigned female at birth who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don t enter the planning methods level of detail which is good I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren t medically accurate and relies on me to be their antidepressant I make them feel good when we see each other Obviously I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship but my SO s refusal to get medical care for their depression using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health They got upset at me over text when I said I couldn t meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week I am in a very involved premed program They live about minutes away so most of our communication is via text video calls A couple nights ago we had this exchange SO I want to die me Do you think you re going to hurt yourself tonight SO I m already hurting myself me at this point shaking because I am upset and afraid they re attempting suicide self harming How SO I m trying to write an essay I can t type both A similar scenario has gone down a couple times my SO saying they want to die end my suffering end me and then when I try to figure out what s going on I m called a nerd or told stop worrying about me harshly or even just ignored One time they said they wanted to kill themselves I responded saying something like there are other ways to make the pain get better what can I do for you and was met with what are you going to do if I kill myself spank me That message honestly made me sick to my stomach I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me I understand what it s like to be in that dark awful place but I feel like I m being played with especially with the suicidal comments that when I inquire about them I am met with sarcasm or teasing It is hurting me I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so What should I do you guys I don t know what is going on I don t know if my SO is being serious or messing with me I don t know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage and I don t know if I should stay with them if this continues not because they have depression but because they won t address it against the advice of numerous medical professionals We ve only been together a month I really like them and am willing to be there for support but I m not an antidepressant I m a person with needs and a history of severe depression I really don t want to fall back into hurting myself Please help me figure out how to navigate this,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Oh where to begin I ve been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth This caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird out there bad ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me But I just shrugged it off and kept on going Then in middle school I started getting bullied couldn t walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy Then I was homeschooled in th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit But I just kept going And then in th grade I went back to school and finally made friends People still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me But I actually made friends Then in high school everything got better at first I had tons of friends who I considered family I wasn t being bullied to my face And I was actually happy Then my second year of high school started and BOOM insomnia I became extremely irritable I was sleeping in class wasn t shaving dressing like shit and so on Well I didn t know this at the time but my cyclothymia lesser version of bipolar disorder had kicked into th gear What makes matters worse is I was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist So I was getting medication But can you guess what meds I was getting Just anti depressants And for those who don t know ADs cyclothymia or bipolar disorder in my case hypomania What fun Basically for years I was mostly hypomanic I m sure you can all guess what this was like Well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance this got mistook for narcissism And a certain true narcissist didn t like this So he went around to all my friends who I considered family and told them I was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me Which of course I didn t I saw almost all of them as my equal And then it gets better he decided to assume that I was also a liar because I mentioned that I fell into a firepit when I was a kid and melted my hand together But there s no scar So I must be lying Even tho it did really happen I ll find a way to prove it to you if you don t believe me He told everyone this So practically overnight my family was gone My insomnia had gotten to the point where I was staying awake from straight hours and to cope I turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep The fallout is obvious So I m left alone addicted to xanax going fucking mad from sleep deprivation and I dropped out of high school months later I had a nervous breakdown cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder I start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls Smoking tons of weed to cope Struggling with xanax and ativan And I have no one Not a single person What s the point None of you will read this far down my rambling to read this I ruined everything But no I m apparently not allowed to be happy or have friends I just ruin everything,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"A couple of years ago, prior to being diagnosed-- I impulsively cheated on my husband. I still take accountability in my wrong doings even though I know it was a very manic, triggered impulse state in my borderline recovery. Since then, I've worked to change my life around completely. I work now, have created a life and goals for myself, and pay for therapy sessions out of pocket (bc my insurance doesn't work with this therapist and she's been integral in my recovery) and really DO the work daily to not let borderline rule me or my impulses anymore. I still feel them-- especially as I was taught from early ages to equate self worth with sexuality etc, but I work hard daily to be better. 
 
 I confessed everything to my husband a year and a half ago, and my marriage has really changed for the better. Before where we had no connection, we have finally been best friends now the last while. Each other's cheerleaders. Until today it was revealed to me he has been cheating on me with someone and has a whole relationship with them. He's had to live away for a few months, while I stay with our son and it just feels like such a slap in the face. I've done all of this work for myself yes, but my marriage too. ): I just feel so hurt. He did confess it all today and said it was ""just an eye for an eye.""

A good life isn t meant for everyone some people have to suffer can we live with it Is it worth it Laurel Is what worth it Life is it worth it I don t know what kind of question is that I guess sometimes it can be and sometimes it is not but the times its worth living make it ultimately worth living I don t understand why it hurts sometimes One moment I m okay and then the next I am contemplating being alive It sucks I doesn t make sense that this is the life I got It s crazy how some people have it better than others and don t have to go through the feelings of loneliness not being able to connect with people having family that is only their cause they are your family Knowing that if you weren t related to them they wouldn t care a damn about you Having people not see you as someone that is worth it Being used and thrown away when it s convenient I m not living a life that everyone else is living I ve learned that people will use you to satisfy themselves whether it be family friends or significant others I don t even get to live to the lie of believing that some people will genuinely care about me I know how women are I know how friends are I know how family is Maybe I ve been given shit examples or maybe I ve been given the best ones Cause now I know I know that for some reason I am different whether that be for better or worse I don t know yet as of know it has been for the utter worse I m only At least that is what I say to make myself feel better People say that their teenage years were the best years you get to live carefree do dumb things you get to live Yet I haven t done any of those things I have always felt alone always been the outcast I haven t got to experience life I have just been waking up day by day hoping tomorrow will be different but its not I still wake up hoping that maybe today will be different maybe my life will change today I have been thinking that since I was in middle school and nothing has changed As I ve aged it has only gotten worse My new experiences have turned out to be tragic lessons I went through a severe depression period the third nine weeks my junior year for reasons I still don t understand Is there something wrong with me There must be right Why can I not be oblivious to things why do I always have to face the reality of the situation I can never trick myself into feeling better about a certain situation I always realize exactly what it is that got me there exactly the reasons for why it happened For example I met someone I felt like I connected with her we had a freakishly lot of stuff in common I felt like okay finally I get to have my person to get close to romantically then boom its was over in less than months It went to shit A damn pandemic hit I just lost her Instead of me being able to oh well its life I fully understand why it even happened in the first place I was used I was the rebound she had her friend group trashed by her ex she wasn t even over him she just wanted to forget she just wanted to hope things would go back to what they were with him She never wanted to like me she felt she had to like me Basically went cold turkey on me Am I not worth talking too You don t even care to know if I m alive I never could understand this and I still don t understand this So I ask a question do you even like me Seen but no reply What do I do I m hurting again Except I know what is best for me I know to leave Its what I m best at Severing the link I say I can t do this I really do want someone to at least like me in a relationship What do I get Text Although we are similar The more I got to know you the more I knew we wouldn t last and that s nothing against you Why do I even bother It s not worth it I felt terrible Not because I broke up with her I felt terrible cause is that is how she really felt Could a girl say we are alike but still not even like me How does that make since How is that even possible So many questions and I just wanted answers Yet I was so insignificant I couldn t even garner a response None to my text None to my phone calls Nothing Not even a drop in the water Why even bother Dodged a bullet anyway but maybe it should have hit me I do what I do best I delete her number and hit the forbidden key unfollow That was months ago What s the point anyway What is done is done I was what I was and I am what I am No sense in changing it only finding better ways to cope with what I am Who I am Maybe it was never meant for me to be regular to be like everyone else To experience what everyone else is experiencing Friends Family lovers experiences Maybe it was never meant for me I want to continue writing maybe I should I could write about how my good friend hooked up with another friend girl of mine and hasn t talked to me since I initiate contact every time but its been over a month and he hasn t even wanted to know if I m alive What the point So many questions At why do I have to go through this now Why do I work my ass off to get nothing in return I m in the best shape of my life I have a source of income couple thousand saved I still feel in the same place I feel worse cause I achieved but why am I

I feel unbearably lonelyHello well I ve been depressed since sophomore year October of I ve attempted suicide at least three times and was admitted to a psych institute February of I started feeling better but around the start of junior year I started to feel horrible again also my bf went back out with his ex girlfriend so that contributed to the depression I was raped in October and my parents found out so I got even sadder My boyfriend and I got back together which made things better for a little while But he never seems to care about whenever I m feeling sad or suicidal Whenever he s sad I do whatever I can to help But if I m crying or feeling hopeless he brushes it off So most of the time I just keep my feelings to myself Anyway it s on a daily basis that I find myself on the ground bawling nearly hyperventilating from crying so much I have literally no one to talk to about how I feel I don t cut anymore but I hit myself to feel some sort of relief My parents won t put me on antidepressants and my therapist doesn t help I m constantly fantasizing about my suicide I find comfort in planning it out in my head and I m also comforted by the fact that I could kill myself whenever I feel the need to I know I m young I know I have life ahead of me but I can t take daily breakdowns much longer It s becoming unbearable and I just feel physically exhausted from living I m not even completely sure why I posted here I guess because I used to find comfort in posting here old account and I even made a friend once I m sorry for all of the text I just needed a way to clear my head,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I lost my friend today Yesterday my two friends were going home and they had an accident both of them were on a bike The one who was driving the motorcycle had his throat sliced open by a pillar he was taken to a hospital where the doctor pronounced him dead but after a few seconds his heartbeat started again he needed bottles of blood which we glady gave to the hospital but the doctor already told us to be prepared because he was losing blood rapidly and there was no chance of saving him and he couldn t do anything about my friend s throat And my other friend who was riding with him on the back had a head injury as well as some other damage like his face is badly injured and some of his ribs are broken and some other things but now he has memory loss and can t remember any of his friends including me or the accident but he still can remember his family But the doctor said that he will make a full discovery which we are thankful for I honestly don t know how to explain it but today around or am i found out that my friend who was in the front passed away he was a really caring person and was always helpful he was a great friend but he shouldn t have died that young everyone is devastated but i honestly have no idea what to do now,"['Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking']",medium

"a sick relative is causing me severe stress iâ€™m hoping i can post this anonymously so no one close to me can find it but i really donâ€™t know what else to do as everyone i talk to seems to tell me the same old crap that doesnâ€™t comfort me at all for context i am autistic and i donâ€™t like change in routine or bad things happening i also suffered a major trauma from a surgery i had 15 years ago and have gotten ptsd from it this also seems to happen whenever someone close to me is sick varying from mild to severe like this 
 
 so my mom has an infection she got it checked out and has been in the hospital ever since kept getting told it was nothing then got a text thursday night 8pm saying she was scheduled for surgery on it of course this sent me into overdrive and i was screaming down the phone to her saying to come home she had the doctor on the phone to me who said it was gonna be sepsis and there may be a need for amputation well of course this has led to me having panic attacks and everything i got sent home from work 
 i went to drop a few things off friday thinking that i was able to pick her up at dinner time just like i was told on the phone that was the next lie i was also refused entry to the room and had my things snatched from me and taken due to a panic attack i was told sheâ€™d come home at 8pm i was not corrected when i asked if amputation was needed or even necessary so this led to more worry on the way home 
 8pm arrives and i text momma to see if she wanted collecting and i get told no freaking no after i was told to my face to return at 8pm this was friday night and iâ€™m sure they knew exactly what they was doing because it escalates they say she can go home saturday 
 saturday i ask once again what time will momma be coming home and i get told once again midday i was at pride and thought cool theyâ€™ll be home when iâ€™m home oh no i get yet another text saying theyâ€™re not allowed to do any releases until monday despite saying that the infection had gone and stuff so i waited until monday monday rolls around and i ask once again what time i go into work trying to be normal i get a text at work telling me that the infection had never gone and wasnâ€™t allowed back for the 5th time itâ€™s now tuesday and i have been given the same crap i get every day a constant cycle of yes in the morning no in the evening i feel like iâ€™m not being told everything 
 
 this has caused me so much stress itâ€™s unreal first the nurses told my mom i was making things up and denied they said anything about sepsis or whatever they also havenâ€™t made me feel at ease at all lying to momma about going home then an hour later saying no for 5 days me and mom have gotten into arguments and then hours later iâ€™ll be on the phone sobbing and apologising like crazy only to be lied to again or the doctor not doing a release which starts the cycle again 
 
 i havenâ€™t eaten since saturday iâ€™ve not left the house in 2 days iâ€™m signed off sick from work for a week i canâ€™t stop crying my chest is so tight it hurts i have heart palpitations iâ€™m vomiting every time i try and put food in my mouth i have daily nosebleeds i have a constant sense of doom and if i donâ€™t get a text atleast once a day i automatically assume that something bad has happened 
 
 i just want to know is this panic all from past trauma i seem to freak out if anyone close to me has to be in the hospital for a period and itâ€™s to the point where iâ€™m getting sick over it constantly begging the person to come back home where it is â€œsafe from things like surgery and icuâ€ itâ€™s always the worst case that i fear and i even fear death everyone says itâ€™s too much tv but i canâ€™t even watch anything about medical stuff as it induces the same stress i googled about it being a severe fear or a trauma response but honestly i donâ€™t know i just want to know why i was lied to but no one will tell me","['Seeking Help', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping']",medium

It seems overly dramatic but this is what I feel I hate my entire being And no these feelings are not a result of me being on my period This just happened and I don t know if I should be concerned or attempt to have a moment like this again I wrote this in a Word document as I was failing to make any progress on an assignment in it I recount something which happened to me this Monday Posted on r SuicideWatch because I want with my entire being to be removed from this life and I might just get the strength to do it myself But I fear if I try I will fail as I do with everything else I lay on my bed in pain sitting in my own mess when I would typically change my pad and take some ibuprofen drink some tea But I did not I laid idle making no attempt to soothe the pain which plagued me I told myself this is all I deserve I accepted defeat Said all the things which I hate about myself Scolded myself for trying for thinking I have or even deserve a chance at happiness And when I finally got those thoughts through to myself when I finally accepted my agony rather than fight against it I fell asleep It was perhaps the most comforted I have ever felt The most complete knowing there is nothing else to be done that I may as well die laying there And I thought of it Dying of suffocation in my sleep didn t sound too bad But as all good things are in my life the relief was temporary Because here I am again trying Just barely but trying And it hurts Because I m lost and I know there s no point but I still try I wish to accept defeat again To lie in the pain I deserve And to fall asleep comforted by the peace of being done Permanently,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Mood Tracking']",high

Hmm I can t think of a good title that isn t generic I ll say it s a normal suicidewatch wall of text I ll start off by saying that I am not going to kill myself If I know one thing about myself it is that I am terrified of dying and will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn t happen I ll try to be short and concise Walls of text are boring and honestly everyone has probably heard all of this before Currently age male live alone with dog no friends one psychologist therapist diagnosed with depression ADHD anxiety type diabetes Backstory years college dropped out many psychologists and therapists many different diagnoses choleric temperament hard to work with upper middle class white extreme guilt of not living to potential years ago I broke down in college and basically stopped everything I hated myself and everyone I was angry frustrated and sad As the years progressed I became more isolated As of now I have maybe one friend I talk to on facebook who moved away a year ago I have no job I dislike speaking to my parents and I really only go out at night when I take my dog out for a walk I guess I also talk to my psychologist he is the only one I have ever not hated It seems that the only way to change ones predicament is to want to change My parents have money I am not in jail and I am relevantly smart I know depression causes a lack of motivation and all that but it s not just that When I would get a job a shitty one I would become quickly bored I never last more than a month and usually I do something I m not supposed to do before I quit crash company s servers make people angry at me ect I am told I have the potential to be smart but then everything I do is wrong I basically have to have my hand held to do anything correctly and it takes me many tries to learn to do anything and I am completely bored I know people with depression and other mental illnesses have a hard time seeing their life in a clear light There is a fog that we supposedly cannot penetrate even though we believe we can I believe I can and the one thing I do with all my time is research and read textbooks articles and studies on illnesses and general philosophies Am I right I am sure I am not though I have a really hard time trusting other people when their view differs from mine Anyway I see my lack of motivation But it isn t because I feel like I can t do things I have done things but I forget them so quickly I have to relearn them over and over Usually I can do something once and then I lose the motivation to do it again A solution people come up with is not to get disillusioned by failure If you ask out one girl and get rejected then ask out until someone says yes but that isn t the problem The problem is I am so extremely lonely but the girls I see I hate I don t want a gf I don t want real friends and then I am stuck in this world I made of utter complete loneliness that I don t want either but it is a lot easier to handle My majors in college became boring as I was studying them I couldn t keep going on I always felt like I wasn t learning well enough I would forget what I learned the year before and feel lost even though I had ok grades I always felt like people were judging me so I never connected with students and eventually I would quit just like all of my jobs and the few girls who did go out with me a couple of times I always end everything and it seems my cutoff point is about a month I feel this insane guilt of doing nothing for society and taking so many of its resources to keep me alive My fear of death makes it so that I am constantly trying to find the best medical help I worry about every pain and problem with my body I don t want to die but I feel as if I am too broken to be fixed and that death is this only thing left for me There is this schism in me where I am cocky independent egotistical unique ect and then there is this other part of me that has no confidence needs babying scared and obviously unoriginal There is no bipartisanship between any of my feelings so I can get something done and leave this horrid place I don t trust anyone not even myself but then I judge myself by everyone s advice and what I believe When I am alone I wish I wasn t and when I am with company I wish I was alone I fear death and yet I wish for it constantly I wish people would do stuff for me and when they do I become incensed that they would do such a thing I get a gf a job a school and think immediately about leaving Anyone who used to care about me I think has long given up Everyone except myself and the psych who I pay loads of money to I think they gave up half because it was confusing and half because what I say made no sense and so I became untrustworthy I would have conversations where someone would suggest something and I would say I couldn t do it They would try to help and I would say no thanks I can do it myself I can see how it makes no sense and yet I still understand how both things I said were completely true Holy shit What a wall of text I can t even TL DR it because it still feels like I missed the point TL DR How do I stop being a white male privileged little bitch,"['Critical

Not a bad ideaSo around years ago my oldest brother tried to overdose due to having untreated depression for years as well as ADHD which might ve partially caused the depression idk don t quote me on that I don t know things Thankfully he had second thoughts and called and he s still here today However I still think about that sometimes I know I would be absolutely devastated if he succeeded as I look up to him however he fell back into depression about months ago despite seeing a therapist and being on a medication for his depression anxiety and ADHD And I ve wondered if he s hoped his attempt was successful Though I honestly don t blame him despite being in a loving household a nice house and having plenty of food he was still depressed And I feel the exact same way but the only difference is no one in my life knows about my depression I think about his suicide attempt almost every day Because maybe it wasn t such a bad idea Just when he thought he was getting better he started having panic and anxiety attacks again as well as feeling real depressed So honestly what s the point I feel like shit now but if I go get help I ll probably just go back to feeling like shit except x I m stuck in a weird limbo I don t have a reason to live I don t have a reason to kill myself I m think about writing a suicide note I m too much of a pussy to kill myself I want to stay in bed and sleep until I never wake up I want to go to school and actually get an education I want to be a normal person I get an freeze up the moment a teacher calls on me I want my friends to find out about my depression so I can at least talk to them about it I push them away then get a panic attack when they start to even slightly figure it out I fucking hate this I wish I could just be one or the other and stop being so damn indecisive I either kill myself or I don t There s no fucking in between,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Positive Coping', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Not SureI m going to try to be brief with this because I m gonna go to bed soon What do you do when you re uncertain about suicide I m sure a lot of us feel that way I know I do Like you think about ending it all but you don t exactly want to However you don t want to put up with the pain anger sadness anxiety and frustration that life throws at us I ve been feeling like that frequently Being in a spot where you can t change anything is really getting to me The main problem is my family and a lot things changed in the past few years I have different feelings towards some of the people I used to love and I constantly worry and fear the future The thing is I don t want to let anybody down especially my mom I m the youngest of three sisters and it ll most likely leave her heartbroken if I committed suicide I definitely don t want my mom to suffer because of me Then everything will be my fault if I left Can anyone relate to this feeling It s a tough decision I want to disappear sometimes but I m not sure if I can do it I ll be in January and I ve got a ton in front of me I m still learning and growing up yet intrusive thoughts get in the way of everything What should I do about this I am seeing a therapist in case you re wondering But I wonder about suicide and cutting myself,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

I think I m done I see no point in continuing my life It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself the vast majority that feel no empathy I see all of these reflected in myself too another idiotic follower of the human condition driven purely by emotion and not by logic Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding I was born too early to escape it too Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible and I could just leave this hellhole behind and things may have been different But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of Only music and video games have stood between me and this They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it so I didn t have to deal with it But they haven t worked now for a good few months The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this Nothing I have tried has helped No antidepressants no therapy no thought mechanism has eased the pain The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man and now I am at wit s end Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid so what s the point in even trying to live with it I just want to fall asleep and never wake up never have to feel a thing again I want to be free from the tyranny of sadness and depression free from the cage of anxiety and panic I want to die,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

weeks ago on my th birthday i went to sleep with a plastic bag over my head after eating half a bottle of xanax because nothing makes any sense to me i am still unclear as to how i ended up in hospital and what went wrong all i know is my dad saved me When i was i use to have a reoccurring dream that went over my head at the time I would watch myself from a third person perspective sit in front of one of those old box TVs watching the tv static not being aware of anything else as i watched myself from an out of body perspective i would sometimes freak out and try to scream at myself and try to understand why i was unaware of anything outside of the TV static My last time having this dream i remember something stopping me from trying to snap myself out of this zombie state This was a calm feeling telling me that it is impossible for me to stop watching the static on the tv because i am apart of the tv i then got realizations that this whole life thing is just apart of some sort of box and there are things happening outside this box that our brains cannot come close to processing i remember waking up completely mind fucked and still to this day believe there is so much more going on in this thing than our brains can comprehend For years now it completely boggles me how people can live like sheep i really feel that people dont think for themselves how can people wake up every day knowing they are apart of some pointless scandle Humans turned this mysterious wonder into some sort of game to benefit people with money power Rich people get richer by paying poor people crumbs so they can work till they re just so they can put food on the table The poor person is told they should be grateful for there job even though they can and will be replaced with ease there are homeless kids halfway across the planet who are scratching their eyes out because they haven t ate in weeks people who run our world are born into money and as long as everyone is going with the flow things will be fine The worst part is it doesn t even matter we were given Goldilocks condition to paint our own picture so this corrupt world simply is what it is all i have known my whole life is that i would rather die than be alive in this shit,"['Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking']",medium

Very calm now yet I m still done I know I have a history of irrational and suicidal thoughts I m convinced that I am bipolar with mixed episodes though I ve never been diagnosed I m used to the racing thoughts and self loathing and I ve called the suicide hotline before in those acute situations I ve been working on my calmness lately meditating and working on developing mental self discipline Apparently I m good at it I can drop my heart rate at will using only a relaxing thought now But the thought of suicide persists and now it has become a very calm very rational thought Before it was I can t get through the night feeling this way which was of course untrue it was tough but I got through all those difficult nights Now it has become a very rational I have nothing to look forward to that s worth the numbness I have to feel to get there Background Lower middle class white male I know I m just the worst believe me I squandered much of my youth because of bad luck and depression lost my job in right before the crash and stayed mostly unemployed for five years Never went to college even though that would have been the perfect opportunity my parents had the money to help me out I was just too depressed and obsessed with the notion that it would end soon and I would be back on my feet Finally got a job a few years back nothing special but it was full time and not a month in the girl I had dated for six years the love of my life and the only person I ve ever felt like I could connect with on every level dumped me only to reveal afterwards that she had been abducted raped and left in a parking lot two years before and she d been living with the weight of that event solely on her shoulders ever since She d never told a soul never went to the hospital or police or therapy just tried to live her life like normal until it finally crushed her I tried to be there for her and for my trouble I got to see her getting into escorting violent and degrading sex drinking and other destructive behavior She broke into my house one night for a booty call and made me hit her and hurt her and say cruel things to her and I did it because I wanted her in my life in any way but I felt horrible violated and told her I couldn t do it again We lost touch after she attacked me in my house one night destroyed several priceless possessions and called the cops to tell them I was responsible I only barely avoided jail She s a cam girl still and I follow her even though it hurts just to see how she is She s doing okay now emotionally and I consider that a blessing I still love her and I always will After that I got into drugs drank a lot tried to destroy myself I got into many bar fights had a lot of promiscuous sex including two affairs with friends who were in long term relationships that I almost ruined I let myself be raped by two co workers male and female because I felt like I deserved it after what had happened to my ex You might not consider it rape I never said no but I let things happen that I didn t want and that made me feel violated As a result of that I was left with persistent intrusive thoughts that have left me impotent with lovers until I tell them what happened basically a death sentence for casual sex I moved across the country last year to try to escape my past and start over and it hasn t worked As much as I work on myself my relationships with people seem to go the same way I have no trouble finding friends I m pretty charming one on one but I can t seem to keep them around I have no terrible attracting women but they all seem to get spooked a few months into the relationship I feel like my baggage is too much or that it makes me incapable of accepting their love I just broke up with a girl and even though we dated for only three months I felt such a strong connection I told her everything and she not only accepted it she had some stories of her own Every moment we were together I felt alive again but for various reasons relating to her social awkwardness I didn t get a good introduction to her social circle and I think she didn t feel like I could be a long term part of her life That triggered a spiraling depression for me that only bolstered her resolve to push me out of her life This has happened so many times It just all seems so pointless I know I ll find new friends but they won t stay long I know I ll find new lovers but they ll all leave me with nothing special to remember them by I want nothing more than a life that feels meaningful where I can build a history with the people I love but I feel like I m just on an endless conveyer belt of meaningless relationships I feel like there must be something inherently wrong with me and that the panic attacks will never go away and that they ll all get spooked and I ll just be jumping from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship forever until I m too old to fuck and then I ll die I turn in a week and I ve spent every one of the last five birthdays alone I m just so tired and I don t see a point in being here anymore except to spare my friends and family the trouble I think suicide is inevitable and I think about it in such rational terms but there s some little quiet voice inside if me that wants me to believe there s hope That voice is getting easier to ignore every day,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress',

I Wish I Had Never Been BornI wish my parents had one child not two I m very lonely Almost every day I cry myself to sleep because of how lonely I feel I have a lot of things to be thankful for I have food and shelter Clean drinking water But I m very lonely It s almost like a physical pain I feel like an alien on Earth I go through about my day and enact certain behaviours that will make me appear like a normal member of society But I m deeply broken inside I am turning in two months and I think I have led a good life years is a long time I never thought I would see my th birthday I have always been a loner Alone I have trouble making friends I had a few friends since high school but we ve drifted apart ever sense I used to struggle a lot with loneliness and I ve put myself out there Talked to people Worked on being positive Joined clubs Tried new things Get new jobs But everything is external I know that everything I do it is an act I will write two letter when I end it One of them is for my dad I want to thank him for supporting me even though I didn t turn out well I want to tell him that it is for the best and the end is inevitable I want to thank him and tell him that when it comes to it my departure is not something to grieve over because I would never amount to anything in life It is better to end it now before I become a bigger burden In a way it is the best time to end it In my letter I hope to convey to my family that my existence should have never happened in the first place I have a darkness within myself and I m always very very lonely I have no one There was no other reason that I was brought to this world I have cried many days and nights over this decision but I think it s for the best I have nothing to offer to the world I am nothing I used to cry and long for someone to love and hold me but I ve finally reached peace with the realization that there is reason that I will never find it I m very grateful for all the gestures of kindness I ve received in this life They meant a lot to me The reason that I ve always been a loner all my life is because I am not a person who can have it Why would anyone love and care about me The reason that is that I should have never been born I m really glad that I was able to make something of my life that would make me somewhat a productive member of society I m very lucky But I have to end it Because this is it I m sorry for the pain that my family will go through But I hope they understand that I ve arrived at this decision because it is the right thing If I were to prolong my time on this Earth there is nothing else for me other than being a greater burden This is a good thing I m glad that I ve experienced my th birthday It was good years is a long time Thank you,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Positive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

Not sure what to do My life feels like it s over Hi I was just directed to this sub I m not even sure where to begin I have mental problems memory issues so if there is a timeline discrepancy or everything is mixed up I m sorry I m also sorry for the length of the post You dont have to read it it s OK I m and have lived an incredibly dismal life As a child I lived with a single mom she had me when she was eighteen She had no aspirations and not much of an education So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life He was extremely cynical of me and would make me cry pretty well daily And for some reason I d cry until I vomited which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems It sucks pretty bad when you re eight years old and your own family won t believe you have heatburn It s like leaving me there to bleed out I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach By the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a special class for misbehaved students This was also in a catholic school It was an extremely hostile environment and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I ve ever heard But it s still happening to this day and damaging the lives of countless children The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn t very beneficial to a lot of the students The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there There were no tests to pass no work to be graded on You didn t even have to do anything In grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town they didn t have behavioral classes but I made so many friends and things were happy the days were bright Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy We moved in with him I made more friends everything was OK I went to school there were no problems They didn t have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia,"['Mental Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium

Just When I Think I m In The Clear I was so sure I was over this But goodness this new bout I slammed into is by far the worst I ve felt in a long time I understand we re all trapped in our own heads but I ve never felt so tethered down like I have by this awful sickly feeling that has been plaguing my thinking nonstop the past five days I know I know nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them but dang I m not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often At all So when I do and I know I m not doing well it feels like I m missing an incredibly important game changer for my life Yet here I am again Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything And this one going wrong is just another lump Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me Another nail in the coffin as it were And it s not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl holy crap I m an idiot And a creep Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago and during one of our drunken conversations she told me how I was like a little brother to her Of course this makes my heart swell with pure joy but then I wonder how creepy does that make me I m just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy The past two nights I d go out drinking and just tell myself aloud unfortunately how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with It upsets my friends who were drinking with me They genuinely do care but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too Who can blame them It s terrible And the more I think about it the worse I get And the worse I get the more I think about it My descent into pure unadulterated self hatred is nearly complete All of this boils down to one question Am I ever gonna be good enough It just doesn t seem like the case Anytime I get a good opportunity thrown my way I don t know how to handle it I ve failed to adapt to society and the world Some people are still crazy enough to care about me for some reason though probably mostly thanks to biology but I ve been slowly pushing away my family in addition to my friends and coworkers This is nobody s fault but mine I know that I just don t want to hurt anyone I d rather not put my parents through losing another child But once I ve got a safe enough distance between my family and me I may genuinely consider checking out It s definitely become a legitimate daily consideration again,"['Critical Risk', 'Mental Distress', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",high

"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. As long as I've known him, he's had slight schizophrenic episodes... They come in waves. He will become horribly depressed and tell me he hears voices in his head coaxing him to kill himself or hurt himself, and while he isn't necessarily inclined to do it, they are loud and persistent... In addition, he says he will often remember a phrase he heard earlier in the day and repeat it in his head for hours on end. He says he sees black shadows in the corners of his eyes and when the lights are off, he will see them in plain view. These episodes are accompanied by insomnia. I also found out a year ago that he is bisexual- I am as well (I'm female, to put it in perspective)- and I now understand that with these episodes, he will go from the very straight side of the spectrum directly to the other side, telling me that girls begin to repulse him and that he loses feelings for me. All this occurs about once a month and subsides after four or five days, after which he goes entirely back to normal. This may be a far stretch, but I feel all these things are connected... We checked, and his family does not have a history of mental illness. If I didn't mention this already, he is twenty years old, which I know is when mental illness can pique. I don't expect anyone to be able to fix him but I'd like to know what is going on with him and if it's been seen before. He refuses to go see a therapist so this is all I've got.

"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why","['Cause of Distress', 'Seeking Help', 'Mental Distress']",medium

Another depressed guyHello hi I feel like shit and I ve decided to share my story At first I need to say I don t wanna give too much personal info in case someone I know came across this I m in my early s I ve been sort of a recluse for most of my life clumsy bullied at school etc Most of my childhood and teens passed by as I was playing video games or killing time in some other way A couple of years ago I decided to change it and live a normal life which ended up in a failure Not so long ago I discovered that there are several things wrong with my body After an extensive google research I ve found out that I have numerous birth defects usually associated with some syndrome that s not the case Most of them aren t really serious if you saw me on a street you probably wouldn t notice anything However one of them hampers my ability to practice sports what may explain my clumsiness and the other one my sexual life that is if there was one Also one of them seems very rare since I couldn t find anything like that on the internets And the whole combo is just mind blowing for me I ve sought medical help but it seems the only thing that could help explain my issue would be some form of extensive genetic testing I know that there are people with full blown syndromes who have it worse than me but still it feels bad and strange And as a consequence I feel very odd it s difficult to explain as if I wasn t really a human And no I m no hypochondriac Apart from my physique I m pretty detached from people on the social plane I must admit I m quite bright and sensitive artsy and find no interest in popular culture I can think of one person I feel comfortable talking with but she doesn t seem to give much shit about me I expect too much I don t want to die but life is just a burden for me I can t recall a moment when I was happy If there isn t any sort of compulsion to do something I could lie in bed the whole day long The only thing that keeps me alive is probably music I m a bit into literature but the stories are about normal healthy people or with some well described diseases however strange may it sound and I can t identify with that Also I m an atheist but even if it turned out god exists I would consider him an asshole for making his children s lives so shitty Also I get restless easily and can t really relax something is always bothering me I m seeing a psychologist who seems to know his job and I have past experience with mental care people but it doesn t seem to fix my life and the world as a whole I would like to say that I feel better after spitting it out unfortunately I don t Anyways it s nice if you didnt tl dr this,"['Mental Distress', 'Maladaptive Coping', 'Seeking Help', 'Progress Update', 'Mood Tracking', 'Cause of Distress']",medium
