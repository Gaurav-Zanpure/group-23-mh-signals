{"post": "Stop making suicide about you I m sorry to rant I really am I was just reading a post about a guy who had an acquaintance die by suicide and how he s feeling overwhelmed and anxious I know it s a terrible thing but what bothers me is that the comment section is all like ohh I am so sorry for you and I can t imagine what you are going through Are you fucking serious This is not about him a human being has died and he s thinking about his fucking self God damn this just reaffirms my wanting to die Like people don t care They only want to stop you from killing yourself and don t care about the pain you re in because they don t want to feel bad about your death This is it No one wants to feel bad about your death so just stay alive and suffer endlessly Gosh Poor dude that killed himself I really don t want to imagine the type of pain and suffering that went through his head If death brought him more peace than this life ever did then may he be in eternal peace So fucking selfish Everything", "intent": "Critical Risk", "concern": "high"}
