 by the time it was 430 i was still doing my hair and makeup i let my mom know and she said that her and my dad were leaving and that i could uber myself there i felt really sad and embarrassed but understood 
 
 i know it was my fault and she has every right to do that a part of me still feels sad she did that on my birthday it was a really low key dinner with just the 3 of us at a restaurant down the street i felt like we wouldâ€™ve been fine if we left at 5 and still gotten seated 
 
 her strict punctuality has always brought me stress in my life and it doesnâ€™t help having severe depression and anxiety iâ€™ve always struggled with time and iâ€™m always anxious about because of her also different places and people have varying attitudes towards time for example my friends arenâ€™t punctual at all like if weâ€™re getting together at 6 we all know that technically means 6307 thatâ€™s just how we are my dadâ€™s side of the family are laid back about time too and are not punctual",Cause of Distress; Seeking Help,Low

"a sick relative is causing me severe stress iâ€™m hoping i can post this anonymously so no one close to me can find it but i really donâ€™t know what else to do as everyone i talk to seems to tell me the same old crap that doesnâ€™t comfort me at all for context i am autistic and i donâ€™t like change in routine or bad things happening i also suffered a major trauma from a surgery i had 15 years ago and have gotten ptsd from it this also seems to happen whenever someone close to me is sick varying from mild to severe like this 
 
 so my mom has an infection she got it checked out and has been in the hospital ever since kept getting told it was nothing then got a text thursday night 8pm saying she was scheduled for surgery on it of course this sent me into overdrive and i was screaming down the phone to her saying to come home she had the doctor on the phone to me who said it was gonna be sepsis and there may be a need for amputation well of course this has led to me having panic attacks and everything i got sent home from work 
 i went to drop a few things off friday thinking that i was able to pick her up at dinner time just like i was told on the phone that was the next lie i was also refused entry to the room and had my things snatched from me and taken due to a panic attack i was told sheâ€™d come home at 8pm i was not corrected when i asked if amputation was needed or even necessary so this led to more worry on the way home 
 8pm arrives and i text momma to see if she wanted collecting and i get told no freaking no after i was told to my face to return at 8pm this was friday night and iâ€™m sure they knew exactly what they was doing because it escalates they say she can go home saturday 
 saturday i ask once again what time will momma be coming home and i get told once again midday i was at pride and thought cool theyâ€™ll be home when iâ€™m home oh no i get yet another text saying theyâ€™re not allowed to do any releases until monday despite saying that the infection had gone and stuff so i waited until monday monday rolls around and i ask once again what time i go into work trying to be normal i get a text at work telling me that the infection had never gone and wasnâ€™t allowed back for the 5th time itâ€™s now tuesday and i have been given the same crap i get every day a constant cycle of yes in the morning no in the evening i feel like iâ€™m not being told everything 
 
 this has caused me so much stress itâ€™s unreal first the nurses told my mom i was making things up and denied they said anything about sepsis or whatever they also havenâ€™t made me feel at ease at all lying to momma about going home then an hour later saying no for 5 days me and mom have gotten into arguments and then hours later iâ€™ll be on the phone sobbing and apologising like crazy only to be lied to again or the doctor not doing a release which starts the cycle again 
 
 i havenâ€™t eaten since saturday iâ€™ve not left the house in 2 days iâ€™m signed off sick from work for a week i canâ€™t stop crying my chest is so tight it hurts i have heart palpitations iâ€™m vomiting every time i try and put food in my mouth i have daily nosebleeds i have a constant sense of doom and if i donâ€™t get a text atleast once a day i automatically assume that something bad has happened 
 
 i just want to know is this panic all from past trauma i seem to freak out if anyone close to me has to be in the hospital for a period and itâ€™s to the point where iâ€™m getting sick over it constantly begging the person to come back home where it is â€œsafe from things like surgery and icuâ€ itâ€™s always the worst case that i fear and i even fear death everyone says itâ€™s too much tv but i canâ€™t even watch anything about medical stuff as it induces the same stress i googled about it being a severe fear or a trauma response but honestly i donâ€™t know i just want to know why i was lied to but no one will tell me",Mental Distress; Positive Coping; Seeking Help,Low

"stuck for weeks hello i would like to preface this spiel by explaining what i mean by being stuck two weeks ago i had an episode before a test which i rarely if ever get i originally thought it was a bad panic attack characterized by rls heart palpitations constant perspiration and extreme issues concentrating and even being slightly incoherent the test passed i even got a good grade but the feeling still remained days after i feel it slowly going away 2 weeks after the fact but itâ€™s at a rate that is annoying since it feels like barely anything is helping 
 on the third day of waking up then going to bed extremely anxious and on the verge of a panic attack i went to my general doctor from there they prescribed me 5mg xanax twice daily as needed the alprazolam did not help it just dampened the sense of panic and i still had most of my physical symptoms 
 
 my question to everyone who reads this is â€œwhat do you do to mitigate these annoying side effects and are there any natural remediesâ€
 
 ps iâ€™m on gabapentin 300mg 3x a day propanalol 30mg twice daily guanfacine 3mg er lexapro 30mg and trazadone 50mg all of which did nothing to help with these feelings the past two weeks",Mental Distress; Mood Tracking; Seeking Help,Low

"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why","Mental Distress, Causes of Distress, Seeking Help",Medium
"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything.

If they divorce I do not know what side to take, but I know them well enough to tell that they will make me choose one.I am well aware that divorced parents is a very common thing. I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other, but clearly I was far from right.

Even if I have a job, I find it meaningless too, to wake up at 7am for a 9am job, reaches home at 7pm, only a few hours left to do my stuff and then sleeping early cos you got to get up early next day again, that goes on for the rest of my life which I do not like it at all. I tried to sell some stuff online to support myself financially, but that is not working out. Now that our breadwinner has passed on, we are left with a huge debt for housing loan, and also suffering from monthly utilities bills. Family and relatives only tell me to go out to work so that I can have an income to support the family. Others look down on me. Since I am so useless, I am slowly losing my will to live. I just want to leave and go to a happier world. Slowly losing my will to survive, do I have anymore reasons to live on?","Mental Distress, Causes of Distress",Medium

"I have had a funny feeling lately. Kind of unusual. Its like I woke up from a nap kind of late after a long day of work.When I awoke it was already dark, and suddenly my dark apartment felt extremely dark. And the Normal solitude I am accustomed to became so intolerable. It almost felt like a panic attack in a way.Yet my heart was not racing. Yet I felt on edge, and so so very alone.I busied myself with some quick chores. Suddenly a friend of mine messaged and I messaged them back quickly. They even called and its like I was so thrilled to talk with them for awhile and the feeling began to fade.I just do not understand it well.I have lived alone for several years nowand I am accustomed to it even prefer it at times.And yet waking up suddenly this evening the feeling of being alone felt like a prison. Completely intolerable.I was curious if anyone has ever felt anything like that. I know I have been a bit depressed latelyIm wondering if some of my anxiety symptoms are returning perhaps in a different way.

"I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless, I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sh*t","Mental Distress, Causes of Distress",Medium

I am a make and I am 16 and I just broke up with my gf. When I was little I was touched by a girl in my school and she kept doing it even after I said no. Although I told my close friends what happened they told me I was a loser and that I should have liked it. Sometimes when I go to sleep at night I can still hear there voices telling me I am a loser and my recent relationship did not help. During the relationship I felt like I was more of a therapist than I was her boyfriend and she dumped all of her problems and issues on to me and expected me to be able to make her feel better every time. This made me feel horrible about myself because anytime I did not make her feel better we would have an argument and then he would say she was wrong and apologize. We have had more than 60 arguments over our 6 month relationship. And anytime I would ask my friends if I should break up with her they would say no. But during my last two weeks of school my parents told me I could not call anyone or play games so my grades would stay up. The same friends that told me not to break up with her told her to break up with me for not talking to her. I broke up with her because she wants me to give her 6 hours a day and anytime I ask for time to myself she would see upset. I hate myself right now and I do not know why. I have cut myself multiple times and have to pretend like everything is ok when in reality I am 5 seconds away from breaking down.

"hi all,i want to start by saying i have a good support system at the moment and am utilizing all of my resources to push through this. but I have made an observation about myself and my thoughts recently. lately i have not been drinking much. and that is good. but when i do, i indulge. subsequently, i feel painfully depressed for DAYS after. the physical symptoms of my hangovers are bad, but the mental symptoms are much, much worse. i struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts when sober, but have a regimented self care method to manage it. and i manage quite well. so the spiral i feel after one single night of drinking is distressing.i know alcohol is a depressant, and i know that it does not particularly make anyone feel good. but i was wondering if anyone else feels this way after a night of drinking, where you cannot shake suicidal thoughts and feelings for up to a week. my friends are normal in that they obviously feel shitty the day after drinking, but not for multiple days. so I am feeling alone. evidently the solution is to probably stop drinking altogether, but i just wanted to see if anyone else has felt such intensity from a single night of drinking, and if anyone has any advice. from alcohol, to sex, to social media consumption: normal human experiences never feel normal. i either feel things too intensely, or i feel completely numb. i just want to be able to enjoy things normally, and to react to setbacks (like hangovers) in a perceivably normal way. but i cannot. but I am going to keep trying.thank you i just need a place to talk about this","Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium

"Hey, i have made some progress mentally since I started taking antidepressants but somehow I still cannot get over this issue, not with pills, not with therapy. Wherever I am, alone or with friends i constantly feel like the ugliest person in the room, i admit I might not be what society considers pretty but I just think this is too much, it does not make sense that I hate how I look so much and i know it is not good for my mental health but I cannot avoid it. I just always feel like I am the ugliest, sometimes I think I should not be allowed to go out and I feel bad for the people that have to see me because I am so ugly.

"Without going into detail, this diagnosis explains so much. The sudden break ups, severe mood swings, destructive and controlling behaviour - all makes a lot more sense now.
 We have been on and off for the past 7 months since we broke up, but recently we’ve been on and it’s genuinely felt like we’re rebuilding a meaningful connection again.
 She came to me straight away after her psychology appointment to talk to me about it, and what it could mean for us in the future. She shared her insecurities and concerns about it, but also what she knows she can build on within her self moving forward. She told me with confidence that she is willing to give our relationship a good shot again, and I am too.
 Being aware of her diagnosis, we can work together and with help of her psychologist it looks like she’s getting back on track again - and I’m willing to support her through all of this.
 She’s asked me not to tell anyone about this at least until she’s ready, so that’s why I’ve come here to update this subreddit.
 Anyone willing to share any experiences or give any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",Seeking Help,Medium
"I grew up mostly dating men but realized when I was a teenager that I also like women. I know for sure that I am attracted to women, but I go off and on with feeling or knowing if I like men. Do I dislike my male ex’s because they did me wrong or because I forced myself to date men through compulsory heterosexuality?
 A few years ago I did believe that I was a lesbian, then went back to bisexual a year later. Now I feel like I am a lesbian again but honestly I really am not sure.
 I label myself as queer now because I don’t know if I truly fit into the bisexual category or lesbian category.

"Hello fellow friends 😄
 
 I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.
 
 There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?
 
 For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 
 
 I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:
 
 ""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""
 
 To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""

 Been out of the dating scene for two years after a string of awful relationships. Me and this girl have talked as friends everyday for 6 months been dating for 3, and it’s great overall I love her very much. 
 
 With the new relationship ive found myself creeping into old thought patterns and codependency. I’ve never been to a psychiatrist or anything, just been obsessed with personal development since I was 14. It’s hard to deal with because logically she has done nothing to trigger these emotions.
 
 I thought I had these aspects of myself dealt with and released but there’s still more. I find myself worrying about every little change in energy or if she will just get bored and leave me. I feel as if I never do enough when I give my absolute all. It’s very confusing and I struggle on my end to not resent myself.
 
 I can’t afford going to therapy or anything but, I’m just wondering if anybody feels the same or has any advice.

"Two days ago I posted something so cute about hitting 76 days clean and now I’m all fucked up. Idk what happened but my bf (LDR) said that he wanted to shorten my trip length from a week to just a weekend. This changed comes after about a week of him acting really weird, he says he’s got a concussion but he worked and drank too much making it worse. I was ok with that but I wish he told me before when he was acting weird so I knew. 
 
 He wasn’t talking to me or texting me as much as he used to saying he needs to minimize phone time or he just doesn’t use his phone when he’s out or with fam or friends but he’s with them 24/7!! The phone is literally how we communicate and how this relationship works!! I felt abandoned like he just didn’t care bc he refused to compromise, we went from talking ~1-2 hr on the phone each day and like 500???? texts to like ~30 min on the phone and 100 texts a day. 
 
 I really hurt. I felt alone. He has so much time with his friends and family in person and I don’t ever get to see him, and he still wants to shorten our trip that is literally still a week and a half away bc of his concussion when he literally does the same stuff we’d be doing maybe even more when I came up. He says he needs to feel independent but I’m literally 1000 miles away and am just ducking asking for 8% of ur time every day. 
 
 He knew I had BPD from the start but I have genuinely been able to control it better than ever before until tonight. I just feel like he’s making excuses to not talk to me and not let me come up anymore, but why? You know what my mind jumps to… I believe him when he says he had a concussion but I really just feel like he changed into a different person. He went from being the perfect person everyone loved him promising me everything caring and understanding and now he acts like I’m fucking disgusting and he hates me. 
 
 Tonight he promised me that I would have a chance to call and talk to him for a while, but then he called late and said he was tired and needed to go to sleep to rest up instead but then I texted him a little later and he texted back and he had just been chilling with his brother who he sees CONSTANTLY. And then called his friend instead of talking to me after promising me!! He always sees and talks to these people he lives so close to them! He literally just acts like he fucking hates me and I’ve kept it together for a fucking week and a half and I really just wanted to fuckinf see him for enough time.

"Is it overcompensating because you feel unworthy, so you need to give others an added value, because you aren't one ?
 Is it you picking narcissistic people so that they feed of you, since it's familiar?
 Is it out of kindness and empathy?
 Is it out of guilt?
 Were you trying to save yourself through them?
 Why the self sacrifice?
 Why doing so and not being at all happy about it, even angry at yourself?
 Why those people disappear once you stuck on their side when they were in distress? Or was it you pushing them away, because you feel that now that you aren't needed you will be discarded? Or them changing their attitude? Are you the jerk at the end ? Or is it them ?
 And why does it feel good, so good when you weren't the one that messed it up, after asking most of the people you know, if you did? And why can't you get over it, ever, when you did?
 
 I've never had a ""sure"" answer for those questions, I don't trust my judgement, and maybe I'm just victimising myself, or maybe I'm not.

 i just found out about bpd from dr daniel fox on youtube (lmao) and went on a binge, and damn, so many things i KNOW i underplayed on this test were brought up in some of these vids.

"A couple of years ago, prior to being diagnosed-- I impulsively cheated on my husband. I still take accountability in my wrong doings even though I know it was a very manic, triggered impulse state in my borderline recovery. Since then, I've worked to change my life around completely. I work now, have created a life and goals for myself, and pay for therapy sessions out of pocket (bc my insurance doesn't work with this therapist and she's been integral in my recovery) and really DO the work daily to not let borderline rule me or my impulses anymore. I still feel them-- especially as I was taught from early ages to equate self worth with sexuality etc, but I work hard daily to be better. 
 
 I confessed everything to my husband a year and a half ago, and my marriage has really changed for the better. Before where we had no connection, we have finally been best friends now the last while. Each other's cheerleaders.

 And let me just say, these magic little tic tacs have made a world of difference for me, when combined with therapy and my antidepressant. A year ago, my romantic relationship was particularly triggering, and I was prone to episodes of rage and self harm. I felt horribly inadequate, alien and at a constant risk of being abandoned.
 
 Nowadays, my moods are steadier, without any sense of being ""zombified.""

My self perception is also a lot more rational- I still see my faults, but they don't seem world-ending, anymore. The people around me seem more accepting, trustworthy and empathetic. 
 
 Even if they're not prescribed Abilify, I highly recommend that anyone who is feeling ""stuck"" in their current treatment speaks to their psychiatrist about treatment options. I had to specifically ask about them, months after my diagnosis, to start the conversation.

 TLDR at bottom with quotes from article.

 I can’t sleep, so I’ve been laying in bed contemplating my mental health and doing cell phone research. Anyway, came across this article that was REALLY interesting to me.
 
 I’ve never been tested for autism, but I’ve suspected most my life, never tested because parents didn’t see it and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then several years later the diagnosis was corrected to bpd, and I just put it off as okay bpd has similar things that’s all it is.
 
 However, my wife and I both have bpd and we’ve been comparing thought processes and talking about mental health a lot lately. And while we’re similar, we differ in a lot of ways. There’s a huge part of my behavior she still can’t understand when it comes to understanding what’s appropriate in certain interactions or in the often completely different ways I interpret situations. It brought me back to thinking maybe it is something more than JUST bpd, so yeah… the googling.
 
 I put the article at the top and I’ll put it [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590952/#!po=1.02041) as well.
 
 
 Basically I’m not crazy… 
 
 TLDR: I’ll sum it up with some quotes from the study:
 
 “…some females with BPD have undiagnosed ASC, due to ASC not being easily detected in females.”
 
 “Recent research is focusing on the possible under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis of ASC in females [40,41], on the assumption that females may experience greater societal pressure to conform and be part of a peer group and so are more motivated to learn how to hide their autism (so-called “camouflaging”) and thereby go “under the radar” of clinicians or school psychologists, by “pretending to be normal” [42]. This may lead to them either receiving their ASC diagnosis far later than males, and/or being diagnosed with other conditions (anorexia, depression, anxiety, or BPD) because clinicians are not looking for how ASC may present itself differently in females.”
 
 “…found that 6 out of 41 BPD patients fulfilled criteria for ASC.”
 
 “Our findings highlight the need for careful examination for autistic traits in patients referred for an assessment for BPD, especially in those without a history of significant childhood abuse or neglect. Some of these patients may have been misdiagnosed (their ASC was overlooked), and a proportion of them may have both conditions.”
 
 
 To put it short….
 
 Def going to talk to my psych MD about if I can be tested for autism now. Holy crap this article made every thing about me make so much more sense! Now I’m wide awake too! I mean, last thing I need is ANOTHER diagnosis to add to the pile, but if it helps it helps! So much for research articles putting people to sleep.""",Positive Coping,Low

"it's very difficult to figure out cuz there's a lot that's going on rn in my life that might have caused this. basically i had a great past week or so, but i think since Wednesday ish i just feel like shit. i can't force myself to do anything, the smallest inconvenience makes me want to scream, i don't want to talk to my parents and after im done with work i just eat and work on my stupid ""passion projects"" until i pass out at 2 am. funny thing is I'm not depressed perse, like im not sad over anything i just feel empty and weak. there are a couple possible reasons for this. might be withdrawal from Adderall (long story), might be just the fact that my job in customer service is finally taking its tole on me, might be an argument i had with my dad, I'm not really sure. whatever it is it's a shitty feeling. if any of u have had bipolar, I'd like to ask u if ur mood swings are triggered by something or are they just random?",Miscellaneous,Low
"I have no idea what is happening to me, but what I'm feeling is absolute emptiness, and despair. I'm numb to everything I think. I hope this feeling ends soon, I've been this way for the past week, it's felt like years though and it's horrific. I'm so tired... So tired. I need a break. I want to sleep and have good dreams. I want to sit still and feel peace. I want to let go of the white hot emotions inside of me. I try and try to let go and to soothe myself, but to no avail. Time after time, the cycle repeats, and I end up in the same place. I don't know why I expect things to be different sometimes. Hope seems so stupid right now. I'm trying to have it, though. I'm so lonely. And being with people makes it worse. Even those who I think I care for.

"Hi there, I am a 23 y/o girl with a single mother who is presumed to have bpd or c-ptsd (suspected by my counsellor). I love her a lot but I just find it endlessly difficult to get along with her as she is very intense. We argue a lot, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I do hate that one silly argument can result in a week long silent treatment/ resentment in my mother. This period kills me as I love to sort things out soon (no later than a day), say our apologies and move on. After every argument she’ll say something along the lines of “it’s not like we have a good relationship” “I will get back to you to set up new boundaries for our new relationship..” or she’ll threaten to never talk to me again and accuses me of causing her lots of pain. This is why I moved out.
 
 Ive notices that she copies a lot of the things I do and that she is finding herself at the same time I am. There’s nothing wrong with that but it makes me feel icky. She copies the shoes I wear, wants to travel when I do, wants to suddenly move to another area when I’m moving out of home (when she’s never had any of those thoughts growing up). It feels like she sees what I’m doing and compares it to herself. If I wear new pants she says “where are they from? How much? Why don’t I buy myself things like you do?”. I got annoyed the other day when she wanted me to get her the same shoes I wear so I said “mum you have your own identity I’m sure there are lots of other shoes you’d like” and it offended her. She tried to clear this with me on Easter, I apologised and she stopped talking to me and it was awkward as hell. Shes used the line “I’m going to establish new boundaries for our relationship [implying less connection etc”. I know I shouldn’t have questioned her identity but I wish I had a mum who had her own taste and timeline. She’s 53. I hate that she holds resentment for so long. It’s awfully tiring and I can’t sleep. Me and my bf can sort issues out more efficiently and it’s so much healthy.

"47 y/o male. Divorced. In stable relationship now - finally. 
 
 While visiting my parents this weekend, I opened a box which contained painful memories. One was so many letters and cute things from my courtship with my ex-wife and mother of my child. I’ve been able to come to a place where I don’t fully blame myself for the end of my marriage. I get that it was both of us, only I did the acting out. Of course.
 
 What is more painful tonight is that my mom kept every letter my college ex girlfriend wrote me. Reading back, it’s so easy to see the pure love she had that was so hard to see then. She was also the one who took the most emotional abuse, when I was at worst and had absolutely zero self-awareness. All these letters and pics showed a genuinely good person who did not deserve any of what I subjected her to, and that is difficult.
 
 It’s been over 20 years. I since had a 14 year marriage which ended, have a ten year-old son, fell hard, and have gotten up. I have my pain, but I now manage myself better than ever. I have a partner of three years I treat well. I just feel for this woman who so clearly loved me, but got the worst of me, tonight.
 
 We last had contact in about 2005 or 2006. It was still loving and caring, inquiring about each other’s friends and families. I know she has three kids and a good life.I tried an FB message about eight years go which was never read - no assumptions made. I want to say how sorry I am. She loved me so goddamn much, but I also don’t see the use. The right thing is to cherish what I have and not repeat this a third time in my life.","Progress Update, Mood Tracking",Medium

 I also feel ashamed that I’m in my 30’s and I get mad at my sister for not getting back to me in a timely manner. This has been going on for YEARS though. The thing is, my brain decided a long time ago that I don’t even want to talk to her, but I try to because I feel bad for her. I want her to know she still has family. I’m here. But I don’t want to be here. And the weird times she does text me, I really don’t even want to talk to her. Not even because of the texting thing, but just because I don’t care about her being in my life.

"My (24f) girlfriend and I (27m) recently having been doing some research and talking about how she shows a number of signs of BPD. Thanks to Dr Keith Gaynor's brilliant lecture on BPD we're pretty sure it was her car accident a few years ago that was the traumatic stress trigger that caused her BPD to spiral and it's been very up and down ever since. As you all probably know having this condition, the lows and highs can occur from hour to hour and day to day, and she's in a pretty good spot today and hoping it lasts through the week. 
 
 What makes this most difficult for me is that I don't really know when she's flipped the switch to crisis mode. I can't live my life constantly on the look out for it right now, and any time i'm not fully prepared myself to deal with it, it spirals into a fight between us and that fight almost ruins a whole day for us. Stress about her current job situation means this could be a tumultuous week, and she's also in classes at night. 
 
 We've agreed that the only true solution is finding the right clinician and getting the help she needs, DBT seems promising! But at the end of the day, we're still really new learning about this condition, community, lifestyle whatever you want to call it. As someone who suffers with severe ADHD, from my own experience I felt like it actually got worse when I started learning about it more, it's like your brain can't help but exhibit the symptom you just learned your condition has a tendency to cause. Thankfully I'm in a place where I can support her with her work or class projects if she needs me to when she can't cope, and she's been returning the favor and helping me with my own scatter brain and forgetfulness. We're an amazing couple 80% of the time, and a hot mess 20%.
 
 She won't be able to get professional help at least for another month or so. And I'm truly worried about her and I want to do everything I can to help her navigate her life until then. This weekend was really really rough but tonight she seems to be getting to a better place, so please any tips or things to watch out for to help her not feel in the middle of a crisis every day!

"I was talking to my bf about (funnily enough) BPD traits that I’d learned the explanations of on Tiktok. I was giving an example of one (about tying yourself too much to your actions, so that when someone asks you to do something, like, “Do you mind putting your cup somewhere else next time?,” you get oddly angry and defensive because it feels like they attacked you personally), and I gave an example of my own. I guess it was too pointed with the tone I used, because my bf accused me of having a specific time in mind that involved him, and became on edge and told me I was getting triggered and needed to take medicine. No matter how many times I told him that I didn’t have a specific instance in mind and that I didn’t mean to sound so pointed, I don’t think he believed me. He just wanted me to hurry up and go have some space so I wouldn’t freak out. 
 
 And it’s like WHY does it have to be that I’m attacking him when I am not?? I’ve had a lot of trouble with it before, and can still struggle now, but I’m trying to be BETTER. Even when I notice I’m getting triggered, I’ll sometimes try to diffuse my emotions/distract myself by showing my bf a funny video I found on tiktok. And does it matter? Of course not! All that matters was that I got triggered in the first place, and that’s a point against me. 
 
 Why does it feel like people WANT me to be the fucking problem sometimes? I swear, I’m trying to get better, but it doesn’t matter to anyone! They’re used to me having a problematic role, and that’s just where I’m supposed to stay. 
 
 If I get triggered, I’m a toxic lunatic. If I tell people that I was able to cope better and not freak out this time, it’s a little “good job,” and then forgetting it ever happened. And that happens with EVERYTHING, not just my BPD. 
 
 I’m largely seen as lazy and irresponsible, and it’s TRUE. I’m a waste of space! But, when I finally accomplish a tiny step forward, it’s fine, but not a big deal, because I should’ve been doing that already.
 
 Why do ANYTHING, then?? Myself and the people around me have gotten too used to how awful I am. We’re all too comfortable. But, I really wanna feel/do better and FEEL SEEN.","Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Causes of Distress",Medium

"Hi, this is may be deleted at one point but I’m not sure when
 
 I am not yet diagnosed with borderline but I’m almost 100% I have it. And it’s killing me. It has been killing me all my life. It has affected my friends, my loved ones and myself. But you probably already know that
 
 What’s concerning me right now, is whether or not I can feel love. Right now, my girlfriend and I are on a one week break from one another. I’ve been what I fee is an emotionally abusive asshole towards her. Paranoid that she would cheat on me, that she would leave me. And before that, ever little thing I didn’t like that she did, set me off. When it shouldn’t have, and I know it shouldn’t have. But it did anyways. And it always hurt me later to think about it.
 
 My question is: can borderlines feel love? I feel like I’ve been such a manipulative piece of crap to her, and I just want to know if there’s even any hope. I don’t want to hurt her heart, she means so much to me but I’ve been such a douche to her. I stared self reflecting so much, asking why I even love her. If I even do. I cried so much thinking about her gone. The thought of not seeing her. Her smile gone, her heart to someone else. She can do as she pleases but it hurts me. Do I love what she’s done for me, or her as a person? How can I even tell? Is she better off without me? Can I fix us? Maybe I’m overthinking..

"CW: alcohol, sex, self harm 
 
 I’ve been binge drinking since I was 15. That’s just what you do here as a young person. Right away I think I didn’t have a good relationship with it. Back in highschool I used to drink to numb the pain. But I started noticing patterns like I probably had sex 99% of the time I binged. 
 
 I’ve been through the whole shebang with drinking. Fighting with friends and family, running away from home, unprotected sex, online shopping and dropping cash without a second thought. Trying drugs without second thought. Missing events and work. Cutting when I’ve been clean for months. I once shredded my legs to pieces at my own house party because someone hurt my feelings.
 
 When I drink, all the darkest parts of me come out. My inhibition is insane. It’s like my BPD is just sitting there waiting tor me to drink. I never pass out, I want to keep going. I become a huge fucking people pleaser. I know an issue of mine is I want everyone to like me. I want everyone to think I’m cool and awesome and the best. When I drink I will do anything to seem “chill”. Often this involves acting out of character. I will over share to death. I’ll get flirty just to try to seem desirable.
 
 I’m 23 now and in most aspects of my life I’m thriving. I have a healthy relationship, an apartment. Nearing the end of a bachelors degree. I want so badly to be a good person. I think I am a good person, I just have this fucking demon. The anxiety I have after a night of drinking is insane. It can last weeks. My boyfriend is extremely kind and understanding but that doesn’t stop my guilt. I wouldn’t want to be him. This part of me makes me feel unlovable. And I don’t want something to happen I can’t come back from. And i’m so tired of this anxiety. It makes me want to end my shit more than my bpd. 
 
 I’ve had therapists want me to go to AA and it’s just pissed me off. I always think I’m so young or it’s not like I’m drunk all the time. But now my psychiatrist wants me to go. And I’m breaking. I’m wearing myself down.","Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping",High
"So this is my first Reddit post. Whatever that means, I’m just lost and really seeking help. I don’t want to end up like another BPD story where the love of their life walks out. 
 
 I lied to my partner Thursday, I believe I had a BPD episode and he doesn’t. Even if he doesn’t, it’s my fault, I’m no longer taking my meds or going to therapy. 
 
 On Thursday I made up a lie. About my partner’s ex whom he keeps in contact with (but we both keep in contact with our exs- nbd) I said a lot of crazy shit— I received a “text” message from someone who knows her and said they (his ex and him) would ultimately be together in the end, that he is using me, that he wants to be with her, and that he is deleting messages between them to because I have gone through his phone in the past, that I was crazy.
 
 I don’t know why I lied to that extreme, I just know that it was fucked up which is why I’m seeking accountability. 
 
 What does accountability look like for someone with BPD, I know I lied, I know I’m not on my meds I know I am not going to therapy. 
 
 When he confronted me about the lie on Friday I realized I had spilt it was all black and white thinking in my head. He loved and missed his ex and hated and wanted nothing todo with me. As I’m writing this I realize it isn’t the reality of things but I still acted out. And I need to be held accountable for my actions. I don’t want to lose the love of my life. 
 
 After he left the apartment to clear his head I began to cut because I needed to release all my emotions and built up anxiety. As I was looking at the blood fall I knew I had to seek help I didn’t want this to be the last feeling I felt. 
 
 I have my psychiatrist appointment the 19th at 10:30 am — wish me luck 🍀.

"So, a little background. I'm a 23 year old male with a BS in physics and applied math. So I'm somewhat intelligent (this is relevant). About a month ago, I saw an article on reddit (can't remember the sub) about a doctor who was helping people with an issue that seemed similar to what I'm experiencing. The best way that I can describe it with how the article described it, is that you come to a conclusion on something that *could* happen (or start thinking about *why* something happened in the past the way it did), and you basically go on a logic train to hell, where you follow a bunch of illogical conclusions that build up into a horribly unrealistic scenario. However, if someone asks about how you got to the scenario, they can see your logic that brought you to that last conclusion because they can follow your logic even though the logic is unrealistic. The problem is I can't for the life of me think of what the disease is called.
 
 On the topic of the intelligence part, the article talked about the doctor having to use techniques for this one patient because he was intelligent and the normal treatment wouldn't really work with him. Basically he could see past simple logic problems, but not advanced ones. I think this is where I'm at right now.

At first, I just accepted it, but then he just won't shut up about them. Not just with me, but with complete strangers. It was like he viewed it as some sort of badge.

 You'd think having a mental disorder is a private matter. My mother had depression for my whole life and I never knew until I found the depression pills she hides.
 
 Anyways, this isn't about my friend really. I'm giving him the support he needs (even though it embarrasses me every time he brags about them). Instead, this is about factitious disorder and you. Do you have real mental diseases or factitious disorder? Read all about it below:

"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. As long as I've known him, he's had slight schizophrenic episodes... They come in waves. He will become horribly depressed and tell me he hears voices in his head coaxing him to kill himself or hurt himself, and while he isn't necessarily inclined to do it, they are loud and persistent... In addition, he says he will often remember a phrase he heard earlier in the day and repeat it in his head for hours on end. He says he sees black shadows in the corners of his eyes and when the lights are off, he will see them in plain view. These episodes are accompanied by insomnia. I also found out a year ago that he is bisexual- I am as well (I'm female, to put it in perspective)- and I now understand that with these episodes, he will go from the very straight side of the spectrum directly to the other side, telling me that girls begin to repulse him and that he loses feelings for me. All this occurs about once a month and subsides after four or five days, after which he goes entirely back to normal. This may be a far stretch, but I feel all these things are connected... We checked, and his family does not have a history of mental illness. If I didn't mention this already, he is twenty years old, which I know is when mental illness can pique. I don't expect anyone to be able to fix him but I'd like to know what is going on with him and if it's been seen before. He refuses to go see a therapist so this is all I've got.

"Ok I'm a 22 year old guy. In 2014 I began to improve my diet. I just stopped eating junkfood, sugar, no sodas, and just water and 3 solid meals a day. Eventually a few weeks after that I felt like a god like I woke up for the first time. Before this my mood was worse and so was my diet. Anyway my libido was never better, I lost fat, physical strength seemed to increase, mood very balanced and energy was great! I wasn't even workingout then. Even on days were I didn't sleep to good I still felt phenomenal. I enjoyed doing things in the yard and my irritablility was nonexistent, but occasionlly I'd eat sugar, or drink a beer here and there but thats it. This lasted to about thanksgiving last year. I lost selfcontrol and fell a slave to the holiday foods. Especially Christmas. So yeah I picked up pounds and my libido decreased and my energy but my mood was decent still. This last till about early March this year. So last month I cleaned my diet up or tried to. Heres the thing, I just got a job in March and pretty much I leave early in the morning and come back late at night, and I have to repeat next morning. I wasn't able eat too much. I still ate 3 times a day but I didnt have time to eat a large amount. Ever since then, my mood has shot down, my libido has gone down, now I'm irrationally angry and depressed for no reason! Homicidal thoughts and occasionally suicidal. Like I wanted to drive this lady of the road this morning for cutting me off and flipping me off and I didn't even care she had a kid with her, but luckily I maintained control and I got over it quickly. My mood bounces like crazy, I can be happy talking with a friend and then after they leave hours later, I'm depressed, then I'm wanting to kill someone, then I see something funny or distracting that puts me in a temporarily good mood. I already had an episode of me yelling outside earlier because I didn't want to break anything in my home. Last week I wanted to attack some guy just from snoring on the bus, this is a new type of anger for me. My muscle mass has decreased, I feel a bit weaker, somedays or moments I feel lethargic, hating life and fatigue others I don't, even if I sleep good I'll still feel tired even if I wake up with a good mood. I do notice I get a temporary mood boost while and after I'm eating but feel fatigued sometime after. I was thinking maybe I wasn't eating enough because I know restricting calories can cause a few issues. I changed jobs, now I'm working with my uncle who has a much better work schedule. I'm putting a bit more food on my plate thinking I'd go back to my old self, but no help at all. I don't know if I'm still not eating enough, I did increase the amount of food though. I'm not sure if this is a mental issue or a nutritional one. I'm not going through anything that would cause me to be this angry for no reason. Nothing in my life has changed except my eating habit which I'm fixing. I'm sleeping way better, and again no junk or sugar. Even years ago when I ate like crap, I never experienced this. If this not a lack of calorie issue, then WHY now? Why all of a sudden do I feel a drop in everything, I mean back in 2014 I fixed my diet felt fantastic, I get a little loose with it, try to fix it again now this is happening. I'm confused. From what I remember, I don't think I'm eating much less than I was last year, also I'm less social, like I'd rather stay in than hangout. I never was a huge social person but I still enjoyed the occasional outing. Sorry if this is long, again I'm just extremely lost here and confused as to what the source of this could be. Could being overweight cause this?? I've been obese before and it's not a thing new to me. Thanks.",Miscellaneous,Low

 I am interested in the topic of mental illness and criminality. Today I read an article about an alleged terrorist who had been under surveillance by the FBI for an extended period.

"I started seeing my pdoc in fall of 2012. Around this time, I went into the hospital for suicidal ideation. Little medication change, things were pretty good until spring of 2014. I relapsed hard, purging, cutting, not going to classes. 
 My therapist asked me to start coming in 2x a week, which didn't help and just cost me a ton of money. My pdoc upped me to the maximum dosage of my antidepressant. This really messed me up and I completely broke down and had to go home for the semester.
 I returned last fall, feeling much better after seeing a good therapist in my hometown and switching medications. I was doing pretty well. 
 But for the past month or so, I've been having symptoms that I've never really had before. I can hardly sleep, I can't focus (it takes me forever to read a news article) and I just feel anxious and overstimulated all the time. 
 I saw my pdoc this morning for a regular appointment, but made some of this new stuff clear on my intake sheet. He brushed it all off as stress (I'm working about 25 hours a week this semester.) 
 I feel like saying more would be pushy. I just think that after three years, he's not going to be open to looking into yet another diagnosis. It feels so stagnant. Our appointments are 10 minutes, tops.

"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I will try keep this short and to the point.
 
 I am part of a friendship group. We've been close friends since middle school and are now in our late 20s.
 
 Amongst this group is L. I have known L since I was about 6. I used to love going to his house on play dates because there were no sense of rules. He's from an incredibly wealthy family who never spent much time supervising him. Play dates at L meant no bedtime, do whatever you want, buy whatever you want, reality did not exist there.
 
 L grew up without ever needing a cent - he was and has always been very generous about spending on his friends, sharing the hedonism, etc. He spent most of his 20s bouncing between various colleges but not completing any courses. He managed to receive a diploma in video game development.
 
 In his early 20s he began to develop this misogyny that has just gotten worse. He is an overt (who thinks he's subtle) pickup artist. He will bounce between his ""tinder boos"", hanging onto them until he's fucked them and then dump them and move on. His father was the same and it's surprising that he does not realize the implications of that kind of behavior.
 
 To get a girl in bed he will use every trick outlined in The Game as well as more insidious techniques. He will tell them they're the one and he loves them. He'll be fucking other girls on the side until he beds his latest conquest, then she gets thrown into the gutter.
 
 This bothers all of us in the group, we don't agree with that kind of misogyny. We give him shit for it, we know it's not right, but he's always been good to us. He's funny to be around. His warped sense of reality can be hilarious.
 
 But now here's the kicker.
 
 L has started working at my company. He's been there for less than a month while I've been there for two years.
 
 These traits of his are coming out very negatively now. He is trying to seduce every girl in the office. He is subtly undermining my authority in the office in front of woman.
 
 At a staff function on Friday (which I left early) he got incredibly wasted, hooked up with a girl from the office (at the same time, cheating on his girlfriend who he was taking out for a Valentine's day lunch the next day), lied to my boss about taking the taxi she ordered for him home and drove himself without bothering to inform any of his friends.
 
 We spent all night stressing and panicking because he was supposed to meet up with us an hour earlier and was unreachable. We drove around the city trying to retrace his steps before finding out he just went home.
 
 I've been paying more attention to his behaviour in the office. He is telling outright lies to people, his intonation changes when he speaks to females - he is simply a different person than the one that we chill with out of work and it's actually become very worrying. When I try call out his bullshit in front of other people, he will either totally ignore it or he reverts to some PUA technique he's memorized about handling conflict.
 
 Last night, another friend of mine asked me some yes or no questions related to L's attitude towards woman, and his attitude in general. I answered yes to every question. Turns out it was an ASPD checklist.
 
 I'm incredibly concerned now. I've never really known what a sociopath was but I think I'm dealing with one now.

 I'm tired of crying all the fucking time at nothing because no matter how hard I try or how well I do, I can never feel GOOD for an ongoing period of time.

Anyone planning suicide in the long term future I m a depressed F who is considering suicide but not soon but within maybe years Why do I want to kill myself It s kind of a long story But the main reasons are a combination Lack of Economic Stability Health Problems Family along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life Economic Growing up was hard and I ve had to overcome a lot of adversity lower income household mother dying at a young age being a queer person of color strict parents depression etc like a lot of people here I m in college currently but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major college just seems very oppressive I know it makes me sound like an entitled first world millenial My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school not allowing me to choose a different school or even CC for a few years I had relatively good grades in high school I knew from the moment I was on campus that I hated it lack of diversity and friendship my health was negatively impacted I didn t have a good sense of direction or idea for a major career and never felt inspired I thought about transferring but didn t have the resources or finances first generation college student so I stuck it out though I was depressed I did well academically but since my major department is kinda shitty applied math I m worried that I won t get a good paying job unlike engineering students Like had I known earlier I would have just majored in that instead I will leave college next year with about K in loans Family Generally I strongly dislike my family life My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house as fast as they could My mom died at a young age and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming self sufficient my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife unemployed and kids even though he s pretty old and should be focusing on retirement I haven t come out as queer yet but worry that my family will disown me because of it not super religous but super conservative strict and family oriented My parents are also immigrants so we don t have tons of wealthy family here Health I have a lot of chronic probably genetically caused health diseases since I was young When I was young and in my mid teens I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive After my mom died my dad didn t bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists anymore my health has decreased It s hard at college too because I don t have a car and I didn t always have health insurance to be able to see anyone So my health continues to decrease These aren t life threatening health issues but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self conscious So because of all this I find it hard to justify continuing life I am kind of a nihilist and definitely an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife I don t want to kill myself yet but in years when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide planning once I m in the real world I ve seen many psychologists over the years but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable and condescending even It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first generation college student background with severly limited family support chronic health issues and student loans to be economically secure in like even years And it s hard to see my straight white male friends from more accepting and upper middle class families succeed in life when it s a constant struggle for me And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery what s the point Why suffer and struggle so much in life if I don t really see a reason too Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed with me and is truly planning suicide in the future I m also fine with talking to people about my choices and or expanding on the reasons above though I doubt people can change my mind TL DR Want to wait years before committing suicide Basically I personally see life worth living if I m economically secure have supportive family and friends and am generally healthy However for a multitude of complex reasons all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me I am also a nihilist atheist and don t see a point to life other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High
Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide and other parts of dealing with depression I ve been a little low lately so this matters to me I m long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater so it only hurts a little I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized And now as I am in the class that comes after that basic course I have to finish the script I like how the script has grown and changed and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions There is another character that is the voice of depression and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head It was like writing down my thoughts from the past Too easy to write which meant I could zoom past it faster but I could never watch this script come to life It would be too traumatic I couldn t let other people see that too Especially people who know what its like I know it isn t the same now that I m much better but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide or looking over the edge of a building sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn t do it Confused if that was really what I wanted Another complexity I feel like I ve become the expert on suicide hospitalization therapy group therapy anti depressants and depression within my class Too many scripts don t get it right It s never as straightforward as they write it Even now it s not straightforward a part of me very small wants to kill myself A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants even if it means that I fall back into depression An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment s notice to just stop pain And now I will talk about the script during class like opening up too much of a wound We will see how much it bothers me I don t think it will too much but who knows right Someone in my class wasn t clear about what the character was doing accident or attempt To me it sounded like a suicide attempt and if it is well I guess I ll have to tell her that there s no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day Even if it is an accident someone would be asking her about her intent My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression Not that I don t have depression getting much closer to stable though I know this is long and I though this isn t entirely related But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it s like to consider suicide or know a bit about the ambiguity treatment and reactions that follow it,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

I think I need to check myself into a hospital I need your guys advice weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder It wasn t really news I ve known I ve been depressed for years approaching years now I got prescribed Zoloft and I m up to mg now I ve also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about weeks now Its not working though If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse and it feels like it s not even getting worse at a slower rate Over the last few years I ve made a lot of changes to try to help I went from to I started eating healthier I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects I transferred colleges since the first one wasn t working out I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends I even attended my first college party after years of never being invited to anything Now I ve finally gone to get professional help both psychologic and psychiatric And none of it has helped If anything its only gotten worse since I don t even have the hope that any more changes will help The hope is gone When I was a kid I used to get Pneumonia a lot I had it like times before I was I wish I d have just died back then I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me The latest I think I would be happy if thing has been getting in a relationship I think I m thinking this is the latest thing since its one of the only changes I haven t yet made and because I pretty genuinely hate myself I ve pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA I don t really believe in inherent self worth I m almost now and haven t ever been on a date let alone received a non platonic hug Nobody ever expresses interest in me I always have to initiate thought I ve found this is usually the case with my friends as well if I don t initiate I d never get invited to anything I can t even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit It s not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to It feels like all the changes I ve made over the years have amounted to nothing I m just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time I haven t been able to cry in years so I just self harm when I feel like crying It s not the best release and it feels like it has diminishing returns since lately it doesn t give me the rush it used to it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense Besides it beats drinking heavily like most normal people my age do though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers It feels like I ve gotten left behind on the road of life Everyone is dating some are already married with people they love I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I ve started dating yet I keep trying to explain to him that I m trying but not having any luck Whenever dating comes up that s all I ever get I m sure you ll find someone eventually Thing is none of the I d might be happy if things before have obviously failed but this is the only change left I can make since professional and medical help has failed I don t enjoy anything anymore Dota and CSGO feel like chores EU is too frustrating now I ve already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through I don t enjoy running or hiking as much now and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year I don t have any shows I really enjoy I ve always wanted to learn to draw I m actually a huge fan of furry art but I m pretty bad and I m a perfectionist so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can t do it and get better Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better The logic I mean with get better is that zero is still larger than a negative number so I d be better off I used to think Ok I ll wait until I turn and then I ll kill myself if things haven t improved However as things have deteriorated I ve moved that up to More recently I ve moved it up to after graduation I m thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself I don t even know how I m going to make it that far Suicide feels inevitable at this point like its something I have to do I don t buy the whole it gets better thing anymore Its been over years It really doesn t in my experience All the medical advice I ve been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself I don t understand to what end though Like if I don t kill myself now then what I get to continue hurting tomorrow The only end this seems to lead to is why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum I don t see the appeal in it I think once I do it I ll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night Nobody would notice I m gone possibly for a few weeks nobody would hear a thing I might not even be found My body can feed some scavengers I don t have to hurt anymore people who love me don t have to see me hurt anymore everyone wins I ve been dead inside for years its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up Of course this is still likely a few years away so I m probably not at immediate risk of killing myself So thats where I m standing It s AM right now and I can t sleep anymore because I went to bed at last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again The Zoloft just gives me headaches makes me hungry and gives me constipation Nothing has helped and I don t think I can get better anymore I have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon I don t know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point What should I do,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress

That s the oldest I ve ever been It s the oldest I m ever meant to be I don t remember when I had the first dream It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn t even be able to remember They are always fragmented and real Real in the way that when it ends your eyes open and you re lying in bed wondering Did I just wake up or just fall asleep The fragments don t seem to follow a timeline just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out Remembering moments out of a long series of events In these dreams I ve seen the events of my life tragic and wonderful play out before me Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline It took time to get used to having these dreams especially the dark ones the ones where a friend or family member passes and I m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments It wasn t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were As stupid as it sounds clairvoyance runs in the family If you believe in that type of thing I ve cousins who experience the same We ve talked about them shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us Out of the thousands of dreams every one of which that has so far played in my synapses not one of them shows me past the age of My th birthday is now less than days away I ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now Before I had ever met my wife I had come to a decision I wasn t going to live past the age of in fact I was going to end my life on my th birthday I can t say for certain why I chose Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young I should join the group of others who died famously young at except I m far from famous also happens to be my favorite number I could not tell you why I ve always just been drawn to it When my th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of months To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you The plan I d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day But my plans had changed It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age The limit was always twenty nine There are none where I m a proud father watching my children go None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who s aged so much better than I over the years After they just stop We fixate on negatives humans that is It s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives I m far from being a master at this myself Why don t I see myself as older than in any of these Is it because that s when my story ends Will my life be destined to have a dash between Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board Or is it something more positive Does the family s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life Is it a gift we are given to be shown in part the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become Glimpses to show us that no matter how low and dark things are going to get you are going to make it through this Maybe we aren t clairvoyant Odds are it s just the family disposition for schizophrenia another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics I ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics Is it going to end at am I going to see the other side of If I don t is it going to be my own doing Maybe I m not allowed to see how my own story ends not until I experience it first hand so as to not spoil the moment I don t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation I did at one point but then I accepted that part myself The part that feels knows that suicide is an option I can t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately Others are turned and inspected what if situations played out over and over How would she react What would the funeral look like How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down Some may topple like my own but there would be many that would wobble for ages Likely never settling back down into their original position That s the hardest hurdle for me in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself My empathy for those in my life knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs More so if it was self inflicted It has always been easy to hurt myself Intentionally hurting others that I care about though has always felt impossible I know I ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact again and again So I ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others feelings and selfishly satisfy my own I m not even sure what to call it desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending Perhaps it does end but not by any doing of myself Just the chaos of existence With some luck maybe Just maybe isn t the end It s just a new beginning,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

I can t live with this thought I feel sick During last summer I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people babies that I d never had prior This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD which provided me with a lot of relief In the late evening of Monday rd September after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior I basically watched pornography for around about hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height I d already experienced false memories by this point Anyway for that whole afternoon and night I would go from grinding humping against the bed an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens while watching Porn Hub on my phone to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his year old daughter that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again At this point I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video I shouldn t watch another video afterwards purely because this YouTube video had a baby in it even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone not to mention obviously by content Nevertheless I watched the interview video scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again but with a video loaded Finally I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain s daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn The reason for this is that as best as I can describe seeing her as a baby the pinnacle of innocence exemplified the essential humanity that we all have including the adult performers As a result I felt heavy guilt that I now realize to be misplaced for being what I considered to be anti feminist and an evil person Perhaps I overthink the morality of things I don t know My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff I remember going to the sink afterwards and dry vomiting With regards to the actual first person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video I have no explicit sensory memory of this The image in my head is grainy at best I wouldn t have been able to live with myself were this the opposite After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot I walked through it step by step and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn t done anything wrong and so I left it This as a general worry didn t reappear again till May with the rest of being spent going from day to day worries and false memories I even felt happy and content on New Year s Day this year Surely if I d done this horrible thing I wouldn t have been able to feel anything happy ever again At first I wondered if I did do it and I just repressed it or I didn t and actually it s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety I know that in my heart I didn t do anything wrong as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards and didn t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would ve if I d done anything wrong Things have gotten better mildly My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon I m currently on the fourth day of taking a beta blocker to regulate my heart rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it I m trying to sleep better but sometimes the image creeps in too much I m due to get a new set of the anti depressant mirtazipine soon too But even with that it all feels like too much right now and I m more suicidal than ever about this I don t want to die over an image in my head but is this a belated guilty conscience I feel sick and can t think or sleep I have moments of you know you re being silly start living again but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week I worry that I might out of a morbid curiosity have done it I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it and then as far as I know not doing it,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

me about this topic I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries totally different industry that I d imagine for my career I dont know I think I ve accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better I could do better if I was living in a different country I could do better if I didn t waste my time on two long serious relationships I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent s offer to pay for it I didn t want to make them pay for MY education I could do better if I didn t have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme I could do better if I didn t stop making music or writing poems and stories I could do better if I didn t take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey Everything I did seems like a failure to me And worst of all I ve gained a lot of weight my self esteem is on the ground I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything Anyways for people around me I am a succesfull mature intellectual functioning person with interesting hobbies But inside of my mind these things just doesn t matter I was so pumped by my parents my friends and my girlfriends nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills social artistic general etc I dont add value to anyone around me Noone needs me Noone craves for my love needs my support needs me around them I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them I can not seem to get laid nowadays if you exclude some of my ex gf s that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life and boy it was great I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions I used to have strong believes about life politics relationships I m an atheist

above the average intellectual capacities and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible muslim heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire wannabe highly cultural social media slaves plaza workers bigheaded academics who doesn t give a shit about their thesis student women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in I am so sorry people I wish English was my mother tongue but it isn t and I am not confident the way I express myself This life is too complicating too demanding too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey I want to leave here but I don t know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country Here I am an intellectual succesfull computer engineer outside of Turkey I am a fucking roach I ve sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country Noone wants me How do I escape here Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life Would it worth the effort I don t know Death seems like such a sweet release to me I just want to die naturally at this moment in an instant I had enough I had my peak at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it I ve been depressed before even got some medical treatment for it It doesn t feel like being depressed at all It is just there is no meaning in anything at all We are bunch of atoms Dying will just stop all of it I wouldn t care for anyone and anything If I was dead I wouldn t be upset about the fact that I could

Just When I Think I m In The Clear I was so sure I was over this But goodness this new bout I slammed into is by far the worst I ve felt in a long time I understand we re all trapped in our own heads but I ve never felt so tethered down like I have by this awful sickly feeling that has been plaguing my thinking nonstop the past five days I know I know nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them but dang I m not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often At all So when I do and I know I m not doing well it feels like I m missing an incredibly important game changer for my life Yet here I am again Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything And this one going wrong is just another lump Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me Another nail in the coffin as it were And it s not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl holy crap I m an idiot And a creep Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago and during one of our drunken conversations she told me how I was like a little brother to her Of course this makes my heart swell with pure joy but then I wonder how creepy does that make me I m just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy The past two nights I d go out drinking and just tell myself aloud unfortunately how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with It upsets my friends who were drinking with me They genuinely do care but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too Who can blame them It s terrible And the more I think about it the worse I get And the worse I get the more I think about it My descent into pure unadulterated self hatred is nearly complete All of this boils down to one question Am I ever gonna be good enough It just doesn t seem like the case Anytime I get a good opportunity thrown my way I don t know how to handle it I ve failed to adapt to society and the world Some people are still crazy enough to care about me for some reason though probably mostly thanks to biology but I ve been slowly pushing away my family in addition to my friends and coworkers This is nobody s fault but mine I know that I just don t want to hurt anyone I d rather not put my parents through losing another child But once I ve got a safe enough distance between my family and me I may genuinely consider checking out It s definitely become a legitimate daily consideration again,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

My suicidal thoughts I am typically a person who tends to internalize a lot of my problems and do not usually express when I am feeling depressed or sad However I do want to express these problems and talk about them I know I need help with this because I have obsessed over these thoughts for years now I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it s almost no wonder they do But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy so easy compared to most people s it s pathetic I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn t awful I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I m real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I ll die I just feel so lost I am trying to find a path in life where I am not doomed to suffer the majority of the time and live for those small bits of time where I can do what I please I want to live for what I like all the time but I m afraid that s too greedy too much to ask for the majority of people don t how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence Does it even exist Am I chasing after something that can never be attained And if that s the case how do I endure the suffering Because I feel like I am weaker than the majority I am pathetic when compared to the majority People have endured so much more than I have yet they still have the will to move forward when I am here wallowing in despair over the inevitable suffering I will face in the future One day I fear when I finally face my moment of profound suffering it will give me the willpower to end my life If you have anything to say please do I really want to hear your opinion on my circumstances I have kept these thoughts to myself for too long,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

I m heading back into that direction Sorry about the length A little back story I spent years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka I don t remember much about that night I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible I woke up to a trashed apartment I gave my landlord my day notice submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier I made a miscalculation though I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers supervisors and politics I had to deal with I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust I m afraid to tell her anything now because I m afraid I ll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking I m in the same rut I was before I feel desperately alone and depressed The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months Its hard to not beat yourself up when you ve lived alone isolated from about a dozen people for three years I feel like all my hard work has been futile now I stopped going to the gym I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape The constant introspection began to drive me mad I feel like nothing has changed I m still miserable and I m still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker I haven t felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment I m worried if it gets worse I may take up drinking heavily again and try to drink myself to death tl dr Was in a rut tried to kill myself Got help and now I m crawling back into my hole,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Back here again I don t know if this happened on its own or because I quit the meds that I don t think I need They all say I m bipolar and give me these bullshit placebo pills that have hardly done anything I seriously doubt I am and so I quit the meds that I don t need I don t experience the very common triggers nor do I experience the physiological and emotional extremes associated with that disorder It s all a misdiagnosis I know it I don t care if three doctors agreed with it it s all wrong These are the wrong meds and they are going to ruin me The thoughts came back I keep going through almost cyclical periods of wanting to go through with a gender transition only to completely lose interest weeks or months later I don t know which side to trust I was going through treatment for it but I ended up quitting for some stupid fucking reason Now it s flaring up again When it flares up now it flares up to an EXTREME extent I can t make rational decisions my emotions are very unstable and I become suicidal and engage in self harm These periods can last from a week to a few months I don t understand why it s so intense I literally cannot focus on ANYTHING else besides the idea of transitioning The thoughts plague me night and day It haunts me in my sleep I m afraid to go to sleep now I just can t do it I don t want this to be any worse It will only get worse as long as it s not being treated I m almost certain this is going to get worse and it s only the first day of this flare up I m in an incredible amount of distress right now The suicidal thoughts are starting to come back I can t relax and breathe I can t get anything done It s transition or die There is no other option I won t be able to transition in the near future By then the treatment will have a minimized effect on me I was fine before this two years ago It worked I was fine Then I wasn t I m fucking done with this shit I m done I want to end it I don t give a shit about anything else at this point I don t even know how to do it since anything I could use has been removed from the house after previous attempts But I know I ll find a way if this gets worse I don t know where this is going to go and I m kind of scared I don t want to end up back in the psych ward It s not just this stupid transgender crap that s fueling this I also have a bunch of other psychiatric problems that are keeping me from getting anywhere in life My therapist even told me that out of all her patients I have the most problems Thanks doc I m told I shouldn t expect to be able to sustain a real job that pays well It s either part time min wage servitude or disability Either way I won t be able to pursue the gender transition This leaves me with no choice It s going to end soon,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High
Lied my way out of the psych ward So a week ago I made a post asking if I should tell guidance about my failed suicide attempt Someone said I should and I decided to do it I ended up going to a psych ward as I thought I would and I just got out yesterday I was telling them that I felt better when in reality I still feel like killing myself I just didn t want to be in there anymore because the doctor didn t give a shit I told him that I wasn t feeling good when he asked how I was doing and he said If I went to the grocery store and asked how the clerk was doing I expect them to say good because that s the polite thing to do I don t want to hear their whole life story all I want to do is pay for my thing which made no fucking sense because it s not a grocery store it s a fucking psych ward I m supposed to be honest with how I am feeling After that he quickly wrapped the conversation up and the next day he would talk about his life He clearly didn t give a fuck I want to tell my therapist that I am thinking of trying suicide again but I am scared to go back and I don t know what to do Any help would be greatly appreciated,Critical Risk,High

Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys I am in a tough place right now Quick background on me I have moderate severe clinical depression Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time I self harmed every day My symptoms are completely managed by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts I just started dating someone trans nonbinary assigned female at birth who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don t enter the planning methods level of detail which is good I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren t medically accurate and relies on me to be their antidepressant I make them feel good when we see each other Obviously I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship but my SO s refusal to get medical care for their depression using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health They got upset at me over text when I said I couldn t meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week I am in a very involved premed program They live about minutes away so most of our communication is via text video calls A couple nights ago we had this exchange SO I want to die me Do you think you re going to hurt yourself tonight SO I m already hurting myself me at this point shaking because I am upset and afraid they re attempting suicide self harming How SO I m trying to write an essay I can t type both A similar scenario has gone down a couple times my SO saying they want to die end my suffering end me and then when I try to figure out what s going on I m called a nerd or told stop worrying about me harshly or even just ignored One time they said they wanted to kill themselves I responded saying something like there are other ways to make the pain get better what can I do for you and was met with what are you going to do if I kill myself spank me That message honestly made me sick to my stomach I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me I understand what it s like to be in that dark awful place but I feel like I m being played with especially with the suicidal comments that when I inquire about them I am met with sarcasm or teasing It is hurting me I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so What should I do you guys I don t know what is going on I don t know if my SO is being serious or messing with me I don t know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage and I don t know if I should stay with them if this continues not because they have depression but because they won t address it against the advice of numerous medical professionals We ve only been together a month I really like them and am willing to be there for support but I m not an antidepressant I m a person with needs and a history of severe depression I really don t want to fall back into hurting myself Please help me figure out how to navigate this,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

I just called a crysis hotline what a waste of time and tearsI don t want to make a new reddit account because I tried to last time I wanted to post and ended locked out of the site and it was just a nightmare so ya don t wreck my life and find out who i am I just called a crysis hotline and it was busy lol and I called more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times then I found another line for some local crysis centre i used to work as a telephone surveyer it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell special one time offer how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you actually that sounds terrible I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can t see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem so basically I am alone I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares it s all up to you she says wow what a thing to say to someone with depression yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me i know that my life is either shitty or it isn t based off my actions I very much know that why would I be depressed if I didn t blame myself just fucking terrible now I m just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal it s like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house well I work fulltime so that s not gonna work and I don t have vacation days and I work nights so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever well that s not really gonna work if I get up at pm and go to bed at noon pm so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life I actually don t mind my job I actually like it there it s the one safe spot in the world is work I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since but I know it s not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all and then it s just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house but why don t I just move out well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn t work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I ve maxed out my credit cards paying them rent which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out I didn t even ask them to change their habits I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration so now I m stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt I m not even hopelessly in debt I just can t leave here but I can t live being this fat anymore because nobody will love me or even even affectionitly touch me I don t even mean sex I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female you know I don t even blame them for regecting me anymore they all actually out of their way nice to me so ya whatever I guess I m taking some art classes and I found out I m very talented lol I m a very honest person in a way that s great on camera But I m fat and people don t have sympathy for fat people well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss if you just try to put them in a normal life situation people inheritly react negatively because fat people are ugly I think it too but ya I can t fix it I know people won t accept this statement but when I m on my healthy diet I feel great and am not hungry because it s well balanced and not extremely low calorie But I come home from work and it s just there is food and sugar everywhere and as soon I get eating it I want more and then i don t care because I think I ve already fucked it up for myself I might as well just eat more so I don t feel bad and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won t seem like unenjoyable effort and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don t want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get double cheeseburgers and each has calories that s calories I can eat in I dunno stop lights away from the mcdonalds and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs on top of the regular diet which is about under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around then all of a sudden I m like calories over my needs and then that s evey day and that s like all in the last hours of the day and the next day maybe I just don t care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two calorie energy drinks and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash it s just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself but if I ever try to just anything just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction I know we re in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don t hate me because I act like I think you hate me but it s not because you hate me it s because I love yes I know I don t know what the word means but I like to use it you and you ll regect me and it s easier for me to perceive it as hate and you go out of your way to say it isn t and you care that little bit and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it s just this natural reaction and attraction no desperation there isn t time to get desperate and you just say I m gonna play it cool and later maybe do something and then you get home and you remember I m almost pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she ll regect you like everyone else because you ve done that that same thing has happend dozens of times and you ve played it out like groundhogs day where you ve done every possible thing reacted everyway tried everything including not trying and it has all ended the same you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym years ago and I m actually in pretty good shape I m just really really fat I lifting and flexibility and I cycle even though it s really hard being so fat and I got down to I m which the lightest I ve been in ever even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage the first time I ve been under bmi since I ve remember checking my weight and now in months I ve thrown away all of it and gained lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food mostly it was always an issue always adding a few hundred calories here and there and now it s like you can sell everything you own get your debt to a controlable level and move out but I have to move walking distance from work because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there vechiles to work after they moved and took me with them it was a mistake to move out with them but I would have no car and I couldn t take my art classes or even have access to a gym because there isn t one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in thin ice around some shores and I m not tryhing to violate the rules it s just it seemed like a good idea I was just gonna jump and swim to shore if I could make it and that seemed like a good idea then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something I dunno it seemed lik e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone but whatever I m really tired now and I just want someone I dunno there is nothing I know nobody can help me the things I want that will make me happy I can t ask and don t have any right to ask but crying makes me tried and I don t like having to hear myself crying wouldn t be so bad if I didn t have to hear the whale it s like someone else it s like I m hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me I m just thinking wrong reacting wrong I just don t interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over or go to therapy for and all of this will start over again tomorrow but it ll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I ll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I ll be happy that s what I have to look forward to the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible,"Cause of Distress, Critical

The bad guy never wins These days are heavy Not only with doubt and self resentment but with responsibility and worry too Suicide isn t hard to think or imagine about but the word is like poison to everyones ears I have tried my whole life to escape the stigmatism of me being garbage due to my parents bad choices I have not succeeded I don t think i ever will because in every picture i am the bad guy I help my siblings strive for survival in a world that WANTS us gone The emotional drain is so severe that some days i wonder if this is real I don t even need drugs or alcohol to have an out of body experience I m detached every day This message might seem chaotic i apologise but so are my thoughts at this time I know that if i died this night tomorrows sun would rise all the same and the world would turn with it So why does this all seem so pointless Why does it all seem so surreal at times I get that my life could be worse or so I m told But i don t live those lives i live this one And in this life the bad guy doesn t win,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High
Everything is too much and I been sleeping poorlyI live in a bad situation and there is no easy way out I m hungry I m poor I m tired and I m constantly getting sick I m mad at myself and too tired to move I want to skip work but staying home is worse because everyone here treats me like I m toxic just for existing and tries to convince me I m bad and awful for expecting them to meet me even just a third of the way It s so hard to fight back without becoming a nasty person too and I feel like I d rather just hang than work hard to own myself again I m so mad at myself that I got myself into such an awful situation and I m broken hearted that no one else I the apt will even try to get his resolved so I m going to have to get my roommates evicted or something instead of kindly letting them or me leave My hand is infected from trying to protect cats and the antibiotics aren t working and I can t find my cream and that makes me paranoid about all of this Every time I try to sleep I say I want to die I want to break myself to pieces and die I haven t slept more than hours in days and work is in four hours again I feel like vomiting I can t go to work and I can t be safe in my house so the best option is death I know it is not but it is the only other option that gives me rest I just hate it and everything is my fault and I m probably being terrible and selfish for wanting my home to be better for me and my cat I only am alive for him so he won t eat me by accident I don t know how to take care of me anymore I m so trapped and I m so scared to push I wanna just sleep forever,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

Week of grad school and I m already a failureI started grad school last week I was so excited and prepared already having chapter of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook While I anticipated grad school to be challenging especially when I work a full time job I did not expect this quarantine to make things x harder I thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes Instead I m being buried in emails from school directors and from parents I have to send emails every Monday with homework packets in addition to making phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day along with attending morning teacher meetings With all this extra work and stress of parent complaints because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we re putting in for their kids my anxiety has been through the roof This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork as I m constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough so I ve struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers I procrastinated because I m a fucking dumbass and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school Because of this I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at am It had been due at pm I had no idea that even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time days before the deadline I only procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class My other online class is fine I have an A But now thats my only class which means its going to take me even longer to graduate and I m going to be a fucking underpaid kindergarten teacher forever I m never going to get my PsyD because I m a fucking moron who can t manage her time and swallow her stupid fucking mental issues for important shit like this Its almost am and I ve been trying to calm myself down for the past hours I finally found this place to vent to I hope that s okay My cat is with me so I m not going to hurt myself I m trying so hard to control myself but it s so hard and I m so tired,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High
Hmm I can t think of a good title that isn t generic I ll say it s a normal suicidewatch wall of text I ll start off by saying that I am not going to kill myself If I know one thing about myself it is that I am terrified of dying and will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn t happen I ll try to be short and concise Walls of text are boring and honestly everyone has probably heard all of this before Currently age male live alone with dog no friends one psychologist therapist diagnosed with depression ADHD anxiety type diabetes Backstory years college dropped out many psychologists and therapists many different diagnoses choleric temperament hard to work with upper middle class white extreme guilt of not living to potential years ago I broke down in college and basically stopped everything I hated myself and everyone I was angry frustrated and sad As the years progressed I became more isolated As of now I have maybe one friend I talk to on facebook who moved away a year ago I have no job I dislike speaking to my parents and I really only go out at night when I take my dog out for a walk I guess I also talk to my psychologist he is the only one I have ever not hated It seems that the only way to change ones predicament is to want to change My parents have money I am not in jail and I am relevantly smart I know depression causes a lack of motivation and all that but it s not just that When I would get a job a shitty one I would become quickly bored I never last more than a month and usually I do something I m not supposed to do before I quit crash company s servers make people angry at me ect I am told I have the potential to be smart but then everything I do is wrong I basically have to have my hand held to do anything correctly and it takes me many tries to learn to do anything and I am completely bored I know people with depression and other mental illnesses have a hard time seeing their life in a clear light There is a fog that we supposedly cannot penetrate even though we believe we can I believe I can and the one thing I do with all my time is research and read textbooks articles and studies on illnesses and general philosophies Am I right I am sure I am not though I have a really hard time trusting other people when their view differs from mine Anyway I see my lack of motivation But it isn t because I feel like I can t do things I have done things but I forget them so quickly I have to relearn them over and over Usually I can do something once and then I lose the motivation to do it again A solution people come up with is not to get disillusioned by failure If you ask out one girl and get rejected then ask out until someone says yes but that isn t the problem The problem is I am so extremely lonely but the girls I see I hate I don t want a gf I don t want real friends and then I am stuck in this world I made of utter complete loneliness that I don t want either but it is a lot easier to handle My majors in college became boring as I was studying them I couldn t keep going on I always felt like I wasn t learning well enough I would forget what I learned the year before and feel lost even though I had ok grades I always felt like people were judging me so I never connected with students and eventually I would quit just like all of my jobs and the few girls who did go out with me a couple of times I always end everything and it seems my cutoff point is about a month I feel this insane guilt of doing nothing for society and taking so many of its resources to keep me alive My fear of death makes it so that I am constantly trying to find the best medical help I worry about every pain and problem with my body I don t want to die but I feel as if I am too broken to be fixed and that death is this only thing left for me There is this schism in me where I am cocky independent egotistical unique ect and then there is this other part of me that has no confidence needs babying scared and obviously unoriginal There is no bipartisanship between any of my feelings so I can get something done and leave this horrid place I don t trust anyone not even myself but then I judge myself by everyone s advice and what I believe When I am alone I wish I wasn t and when I am with company I wish I was alone I fear death and yet I wish for it constantly I wish people would do stuff for me and when they do I become incensed that they would do such a thing I get a gf a job a school and think immediately about leaving Anyone who used to care about me I think has long given up Everyone except myself and the psych who I pay loads of money to I think they gave up half because it was confusing and half because what I say made no sense and so I became untrustworthy I would have conversations where someone would suggest something and I would say I couldn t do it They would try to help and I would say no thanks I can do it myself I can see how it makes no sense and yet I still understand how both things I said were completely true Holy shit What a wall of text I can t even TL DR it because it still feels like I missed the point TL DR How do I stop being a white male privileged little bitch,"Cause of

This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved part This has just happened to me today Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go bitch pleeassseee Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger It s not that I plan to kill myself but instantaneously I think in my head I want to kill myself and immediately next thought I would think OMG don t be stupid that s not going to happen That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent The problem here is now I don t really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone What happened today was I bitched to a friend at work via my personal email and their work email I do say friend because I m not venting to them because it s my best friend or anything it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work and isn t very trustworthy as you are about to find out I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment which had bits of people are lying to me again I want to kill myself I feel faint so forth Not the first time I told him that in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I ll self harm if I went outside and he did nothing Literally nothing He read it and didn t even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me I was literally just upstairs Anyways the point of that side story is that this is normal So back to the main story I wrote those emails early in the morning then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep After lunch my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police OK sure Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them The police came What they knew was Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I d self harm suicide and they were worried because I haven t sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive They have mixed in some truths with lies I sent an email true The bit where they make a big deal out of it a lie I had no phone calls or emails from them that day really they could ve contacted me if they wanted to However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it The point is I was fine I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day so the doctors didn t think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could ve done so against my will There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of care or worry who says they are doing things that they are not It s hard to tell most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn t right It s just better to trust your instincts People can let you down or betray your trust I m slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me someone with a history of mental illness seen a psychologist Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment but the police literally can t do anything else it s the doctors who decide Doctors at the hospital aren t going to just blindly listen to that story and going to the hospital doesn t mean that they ll keep you there against your will Why did my work place decide to lie I don t know They could be genuinely worried they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance It really doesn t matter They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves As for my friend I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing I honestly do believe if I died he d shrug it off I ve told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before but getting personal messages like whatsapp not just emails forward off to work Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm want to kill myself wanting them to watch me die wanting him to regret not helping me What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help He did that more than once actually At the same time he s pretending he s a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans He is like a human version of the workplace If I can kill myself I d make sure he gets haunted by it I used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more thinking I could get back at them,"Cause of

Suicide watch after a DUI arrest I was referred to this subreddit and it is highly applicable I don t mean to deflect but I m asking for a friend He s a great guy simply he carries a lot of baggage Some context to the current question My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America His experience was difficult to accept and it s taken a toll on him psychologically He previously was an excellent athlete and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana nicotine and alcohol We both attend a university in a college town and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon Last night he drove with blood alcohol concentration over I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn t act drastically Legal action will be required promptly and I fear that the absence of his vehicle impounded will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault He owns quite a few guns and his stability is my primary concern I am staying at his household overnight and he had some friends stop by throughout the day yet I do not foresee this being a long term fix He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions In closing he has great character solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification I told him he should not define himself by one night and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement I appreciate your consideration,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is treating to commit suicideI am not sure this is the right sub reddit to post it to I do not know what to do at this stage and I hope this helps somehow Apologies for the long post I had started working at a company where I M met K M We soon were best buddies and after a couple of months he confessed he was gay Now he is not the type of guy you would suspect he is gay In fact he is not out and he tries his best to keep it a secret This is the source of a lot of frustration and stress in his life A thing which most people will attribute to him being a shy person Furthermore hHe has never had a relationship and I am the only guy who knows He has his personal issues why he doesn t want to come out but mostly it is because he is not attracted to the type of guys you see in LGBT parades However I did manage to convince him to seek professional help which he still is continuing on getting Honestly when he first told me about his secret I tried my best to be laid back about it I continued to treat him as I would treat any best friend Admittedly I may have crossed the line occasionally by commenting love you or xx I guess from him end he was interpreting this as being more than just friends However I naively saw nothing wrong in that Thing is he does not believe that my intentions were honest and that I was never interested in him Because of this we have been constantly fighting and it has come to a point were I cannot mention my SO He stopped going out with his friends and I am the only friend he goes out with Whilst I enjoy his company many times it feels like I have to take him out because he is so lonely This is something I had always discouraged but was always helpless in avoiding He is now treating to kill himself because he wants to see me since we are not meeting often He always had suicidal thoughts but he is treating to do it since he has lost all the reason to live for since he does not have me any longer in his life I am mortified because on one hand I wish to help him but on the other hand I know that I AM the problem On one hand I wish to keep him in my life but on the other hand I know that our friendship cannot go any longer like this One thing I failed to mention is that I have never spoke to my SO about this and this is also having serious repercussions on my conscience I feel guilty because I am keeping such a secret from her but on the other hand I cannot break my promise to my friend I honestly do not know what to do Did I do something wrong Any helpful suggestions will be greatly appreciated Thanks TL DR Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is threatening to commit suicide,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person I m at the end of my rope Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was and I am now Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that in tandem with my other mental illnesses rules my life To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago an event I had long figured would mark my demise I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing but in the days I spent in preparation I met an amazing person who is still my boyfriend I get by for a year with a lot of his help but then lose my job That was six months ago I move in with my boyfriend We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep insomnia is was already an issue so before I know it my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep I m scared to leave the house but so miserable and constantly incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped I fear that dying is the only way out I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it I would love to just run away and live in my car was homeless once but I m dependent upon both my medication and unfortunately opiates The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief though they re obviously a double edged sword I can t get off my meds either as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again So I m stuck with no job a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave a substance dependence that won t allow me any freedom that I m not too afraid of and zero future prospects And this is a very general list If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life this post would be even more lengthy I don t want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family but I can t keep this life up I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend but after waiting all week an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed He works long tomorrow I really don t think I can t make it another day,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

Yesterday I was talked out of suicide by my ex boyfriend I don t really know what to say here I just feel like I need to get all this off of my chest For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone even when I was in a really great place in life Recently the past few months things have gotten worse for me Multiple factors are piling up and it s starting to feel like it s entirely too much to handle This past weekend I stayed at my ex s house and tonight when I got home something just changed got worse somehow and I just wanted to end it I was actually going to do it For some reason though I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed he has school today he wants me to get help but I can t afford to get any He told me that he might turn me in which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I ve been thinking of I told him I d never forgive him and I can t handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone but deep down I would give anything to have some help I ve told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he s just now starting to believe me He told me he will get me help no matter what but I m so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I ve been thinking of doing I can t even talk to anyone face to face about it I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face I m not sure if I have social anxiety the talking to people being around people part depression both or neither but I m sure that I m sick of my life being this way I m sick of existing and not living I found this subreddit through MMFB which I found through IAMA and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown I don t know if you ve read this far but if you have thank you If you care for me to I can try to keep this updated Also in case someone was wondering why I don t go to another friend for help instead of my ex it s because my ex is literally the only friend I have I had a clique that we both hung out with but I stupidly pushed them away,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

K SO x L fan fiction chill I wrote this half jokingly and it s all in good fun no need for pitchforks This takes place a good while after The Rise of Skywalker and follows the idea that K SO downloads his memory to the other Imperial security droid from HISHE K SO wakes up on a forest surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an Imperial ship He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter A Correlian YT light freighter what is it doing here He said to himself He stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he s unfamiliar with The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball Do not shoot I mean you no harm K SO shouted I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you The figure shrieks and K SO found out that it was a wookie It may be impolite of me but I do not understand Shyriiwook He exclaimed in a half joking manner One thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie Chewbacca with the rolling droid BB being his translator He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi s past The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast but with some significant damage to the ship and BB said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship I no longer have a master might as well made myself useful He replied After a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect He s interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way My name is K SO I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system He exclaimed to the abyss You you re like me A faint sound of a female is heard I am sorry I do not know what you re talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system He replied I am L I am a droid own who was a partner of Lando Calrissian and had been this ship s navigation computer for most of my existence I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated The voice said and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me She continued I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I m sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method He answers it is not true awareness Oh it s awareness alright the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to as well as your distinct personality L replied That is not true I was taking initiative by my own I see your point He said They chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other s views Hey thanks for fixing me and talking to me it s been a long time since I get to talk to another person She said Do not mention it I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid He replied Shut up She said in a sarcastic tone promise me that you ll send my message to droids across the galaxy She continued I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most but I will send them to other droids He assured her He unplugged himself from the computer Well now I have job to do He said to himself,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk I talked about football with this random guy I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide I sat at the bar almost falling off the stool and it really hit me this time I really could kill myself tonight I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying Was it peaceful was it scary was it just somewhere in between What it is is the feeling that beyond a shadow of a doubt you would not feel the consequences of suicide because you will be dead All of my friends My family If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them but in reality I won t exist it won t effect me it will be nothing I silently decided ok I think tonight is the night I stood up turned to the guy I was talking to smiled and told him to have a great night He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ok you too and I left My first thought was are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to And immediately I thought yes Who cares It s all symbolic horse shit that won t mean anything after I m dead It s the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach and that s never been me so why should I care I left the bar and just started walking I didn t know where I was going but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars all with a major a plan a path I ve never really envied them or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet for better or for worse Last night though I couldn t help but find the humor in it Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone that I went to school somewhere that I had an identity outside of being nobody It made me think about how there s probably plenty of people I see actively contemplating their death that just blend in like me It made me think even if it were just for a second to reconsider what I aimed to do that night I thought about it for a second I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning Then I remembered I already made my choice I didn t sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now I intended to do what I ve known needed to be done since I was I kept walking and walking and walking I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health I thought about how now in retrospect I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson It was about AM at this point I finally reached a highway It wasn t like an interstate more like a lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it I d see these wheelers come buy at MPH Upon seeing this I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things I thought about it for a second What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident What if it killed other people but not me I couldn t bring myself to do it for that reason I continued walking down the highway Even though I wasn t gonna jump in front of one of these cars everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road I walked until I saw a park I don t know what possessed me but I just entered the park with no intention I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it I leaned over the side and vomited then I passed out I woke up hours later with an awful headache Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it and I let it slip away I don t know when I ll ever be able to capture it again Today I woke back up in purgatory where I ll remain Life is endless suffering,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

I m nothing and I won t have anything enjoyable in my life Firstly I m sorry for my bad English but I m not a native speaker So I m years old boy and I ve been planning to commit suicide for couple of months I would probably do it already if not the fact that I doesn t want to hurt my mother and my friend Maybe you re wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that Well I would rather ask Why shouldn t I There is no happiness for me now or in the future I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness so what s the point of living where there is no hope for me to be a happy man I don t know if happiness isn t destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it but does it really matter There s is not a good thing waiting for me period Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing For me happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy It may sound a little bit ironic considering the fact that I have to cope with terrible anxiety general akwardness and introversion Maybe that s the reason why I want to commit suicide happiness for me comes from a thing that I m not able to do I was thinking about becoming an writer That s a way right People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine Well there s the problem I m not good enough to make it work Although I enjoy writing what s the fucking point if it doesn t reach wider public Secondly I know it my sound kind of cheesy but I don t think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend And for me having someone like that is not almost impossible it is just impossible There are various reasons for that I m ugly and overweight I m shy and introvertic I m bad at having conversations I m kind of a weirdo I don t like generic music and stuff etc It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me it s so fucking painful man And it s really not about sex I don t give a fuck about sex I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone It s about love and everything that comes with that For the end I m just gonna say wish me that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

TIL Nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously even your doctors and therapists Everybody thinks you re just being immature or finding excuses for your failures The only time they realise that you re really in trouble and need supports and helps is when it s all too late You might think the professionals would act totally different But the truth is that the therapist I met literally told me to grow up and be responsible and that the doctor I saw more or less implied he couldn t help and wouldn t care as long as it s my life not his child s I m trying to gather the courage to off myself within one or two days Don t want to live through a life I m incapable of living through while nobody cares at all,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

No reason to live if you aren t normalThis will be my last post I don t plan on using reddit because tomorrow I m actually going to be going through with my plan to just kill myself and get it over with I already have my stuff planned out no talking me out of this one I have my letters written and am going to send out my last text to loved ones which is just family in an hour or two and finish the day playing Pok mon and from there wake up and drive out look for a cliff and just jump off I hate the fact that I don t look normal I m smaller than the average guy and always envied tall and average height guys because they have the luxury of being normal All I m ever seen as is just some loser who overcompensates for his height I never even liked my life that much either college sucks and was a complete lie people told me when they said college gets better It gets better what a bunch of bullshit I m thinking of taking out someone else but murder will just land me in jail not death well at least not immediately but I do plan on doing something stupid since it won t matter so hopefully I ll do something fun illegal but in the end just leads to my death anyway,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

My younger sister has been suicidal for a long time and of course I have always tried being there to help and be her punching bag When am I allowed to give up My sister has been suicidal depressed since she was about years old and she has only gotten worse It began when her closest friends in high school ditched her and turned everyone in her class against her Since then she hasn t ever really recovered did receive some help around then She now refuses to seek any more help says she will deal with it on her own and if it doesn t work and she decides to kill herself she s tried her best Because of this decision and her being vehemently against any sort of help she cut our parents out of her life because they tried to make her get help I have been the only one she can turn to She recently stopped being friends with her last remaining friend I talk to her whenever she feels like it but it always seems like whatever I say makes her angry when all I m doing is trying to help Her reactions aren t that of a normal person so it s really hard to try and be there for her and making sure I don t make her angry while doing so At this point it really is affecting my mental health have been working through my own depression and I have no idea what to do I can t imagine if the only person I could talk to decided to leave and would never want to but I also can t be her punching bag forever She also says that if I try and make her get help she will hate me and cut me out too Do I just let her,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High
I m patheticI know this is going to sound overly dramatic but as someone who has considered suicide since they were years old I jump to dramatic conclusions quickly I ve been in college for approximately weeks now and I ve realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage I am compared to everyone else I come from a state in the tri state area and moved to NY manhattan specifically for college living in the dorms Where I m from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity Now I go to an art school because believe me I m not capable of doing anything else I am fucking stupid And yes it s expensive to be here And yes I got a significant amount of financial aid and yes it s still a lot of money When I moved here I didn t come with that much money I ve been very good at limiting what I spend I only spend money on what I absolutely need On top of college being a lot of money everything here is also more costly So money goes quick even if it s only on essentials Started my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat I couldn t afford all of this My class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time I spent hours in that fucking studio class thinking about how I m going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things but I didn t I left empty handed and feeling like shit On top of school materials I am practically wearing the same clothes every week because I have so few I ve resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if I can help it I ve heard a million different things about student loans and all that bullshit and my head still isn t completely wrapped around about what I have to do and where to do it to make my stupid fucking payments Don t really want to think about it right now but I ll do it anyways My parents are helping me out paying for tuition and shit but other than that I m on my own I m not going to kill myself right away but I would love to open my window and jump from stories down onto the sidewalk and die I am so fucking alone here and so fucking pathetic Money doesnt buy happiness but it fucking controls everything that I can t afford Fuck college fuck my painting class and fuck my stupid fucking life I should have never been born,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

It gets worse beyond death y o divorced male here With one beautiful son and he s god sent That being said he is a real problem as I cannot handle the thoughts of how he will have to go through with life when I discharge a shotgun in my face I ve considered taking his life as well in order to spare him I am a completely and utterly hopeless romantic I married my ex wife after threatening to abort our child we had an abortion a year before we had our son The divorce and custody trials are still not over have lasted over years and has put me in debt to my family trust for over I met an absolutely beautiful and exquisite individual over a dating app about two months ago She fills me with joy and is the most remarkable woman I have ever met She gave many different types of messages over the past few weeks which have all been predominantly reassuring This week my emotions boiled over a bit and I told her how much I want to be with her Our phone call last night concluded with her telling me in essence that my emotional overflow has created a small rift between us and she is in need of the emotions to be removed from our equation I haven t slept all week as I ve felt like I ve been losing her due to the fact that I have baggage and am otherwise more invested in this than she is I ve looked all my life for someone like her I detest the concept of not putting all my eggs in one basket I ve already hooked up with someone else since I met her to do precisely this and I thought about her the entire time it made me hate myself and want to purify and thus has caused me to overextend my affection and quite honestly appear to not have all my ducks in a line in addition to how emotionally distraught I was in our most recent conversation I have a year degree and apply for better jobs on a daily basis but to no avail I am living in a high income area and am no better off than I was a decade ago I have a huge issue with capitalism and coming from both a conservative and military family am routinely crucified verbally for my lack of personal motivation to seek and act in ways that will project my son and I forward I have suffered from extreme depression since adolescence took every antidepressant available in high school and self medicated with marijuana for a decade I can t cope with my situation let alone another great romantic loss any more than I can cope with the fact that I ve never felt capable of overcoming the gravity of my emotions As a single parent with full custody options for seeking help are all but plentiful especially with an ex spouse eager to reverse the custody situation who also happens to be in very dire straits financially Assuming I am compromised enough to even consider the destruction of my life and even that of my sons to spare him pain my only real issue is with God As a frequent lucid dreamer and someone unable to recover from the daily perils of life through an inability to sleep without working through significant karmic events I routinely deal with the aftermath of sins such as murder am imprisoned or am otherwise finding myself in a deep state of isolated suffering when I dream I am very much aware of the fact that there exists a life in the ether and the truth is that my life in the ether is worse than it is in reality I hate God for the situation that planet earth is currently in and has been in for thousands of years I hate that I cannot be at peace having lived a life where I ve tried to be considerate of others and truly feel that there is no escape whether i commit suicide or not I ve felt this way for decades and I ve deteriorated to the point of complete anguish where I truly wish to destroy my life and the lives of others as I see the human struggle to be so fickle and grotesque my mind desires seeking the dark web to sign murder contracts and then as I let my thinking spiral I return to a state where I realize that I truly have no desire to hurt anyone but to completely erase all aspects of myself entirely No memories no essence no soul Total obliteration and liberation through the end of what has felt like truly a life of magnified suffering I don t know how to end this because again in my mind there is no end no matter what action I take but I m so sick and unorganized that it has effected each and every person involved in my life,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
I just need someone to listen to me Back story I m I ve been suffering from depression for or years but I don t want to go back to the doctor because I m scared that they won t take me seriously and think I m just another teenager I have never talked about my problems to anyone else because when I try I freeze and am unable to say anything Over the past couple of years I have tried to kill myself over times including pills and alcohol and trying to drown myself Now to my current problems I came out at gay when I finished my GCSE s at All my friends said they didn t care and all but within months I only had or friends that would still talk to me When I went back to the school to pick up my GCSE certificates about people all my old friends and classmates included started shouting insults like faggot and queer right up until I was minutes down the road and couldn t hear them any more My best friend at the time stopped talking to me about or months after this incident My other friend at that time still talked to me and did right up until October when he stopped talking to me and started doing drugs and all sorts When I went to a new school after a year to start my A Levels I made new friends and they would come out with me and smoke weed and such but then a month ago they did the exact same thing as my other good friends did and just stopped talking to me unless they need me for something usually to ask me for a cigarette At this same time a month or so my last friends had a baby Now I understand that they had a baby and all but they just stopped talking to me as well It s not even that they ve not had time due to their child but they have been going out nearly every day and had time to themselves but nothing Now I have no friends that will talk to me and the only person I ve talked to today is my mom and that was about words I m in love with a straight guy in my school I would talk to him and say how I feel but I m scared about what will happen due to my year group in school consisting of a whole people who are all very good friends with each other plus the way they get on with each other consists of finding something to make fun f someone for and taking the piss out of that for a long time If I did say anything my whole year group in school would hear about it within a day and I won t be able to stay there for another year because people will go on about it every day I can t go to another school as this was the only one I was able to go to since I was previously doing a electrician training course somewhere else I m also poor as fuck My mom has a lot of health problems and is unable to work My dad works a job that earns just enough to cover the bills I ve been trying to find a job but somehow the people with no qualifications at all get picked for jobs instead of me All my clothes are borderline too small and are at least a year old I m sorry about this rant and I thank you for reading it It took me hours and cigarettes to finally get written out,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

FiredHi I was fired yesterday from my dream job in part because of my mental health issues I don t see the point anymore I kept it in for so long because I knew the end result would be this My strength was questioned when every single day has been a battle not to kill myself Now I don t see why I shouldn t I ve never felt so humiliated and depressed in my entire life I m currently in the process of hiding away pills to take I want enough so that they won t be able to bring me back like or so My family know I want to kill my self so they re hiding my antidepressants from me and only giving me one each morning but there s cold and flu tablets everywhere that I m ferreting away I hope to do it in the next few weeks,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Everything just feels shit I m a year old male who is suicidal I told my mom and stepdad that I was very depressed and they laughed and said that I wasn t I ve also told my friends and one of them just thought I said it as a joke and my other friends are too depressed to get help from I have been depressed since I was but when I turned I got suicidal I feel lonely and I think about how I should kill myself when I m at school or when I m eating etc I almost never sleep for more than hours per night which makes me very tired at school and I only sleep in class I don t really have a good reason for being suicidal except that I hate the way everyone lives wake up go to work get paid go home eat sleep and then it starts all over again I also feel like i m such a dick towards everyone as I don t care about anything anymore some people are annoyed by my negativity towards everything Being alive is just pain and suffering I ve almost stopped feeling emotions at all I don t feel empathy towards people anymore only for animals Now at school i ve just started pretending that everything is alright after someone said that I was emo or something like that and now it s just too hard to be happy,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

I could have graduated this week but I ruined all my chances this is it for me I m doing itI ve been struggling with depression and social phobia for the last years and although suicidal thoughts have been recurrent this is the first time where I feel committed to it I have to hand in my graduation thesis by this Friday but I have not been able to type more than words these last months I am stuck at my parents house because of the outbreak and they have already told me that if I don t graduate they will not pay for me to return to college next year just to complete my thesis because they do not believe I will be able to The thought of having to drop out when I only have this one thing left makes me cry every time as I ve always had a lot of pressure regarding academics Even if I typed constantly for hours I will probably fail anyway as I have not kept in touch with my tutor due to my social phobia making it almost impossible for me to reach out even less when it s by email and this communication is a very big part of our grade This may sound like a stupid reason for ending it all but honestly when all your life revolves around academics and you know that you will lose all the opportunities that were waiting for you after graduation the future just seems like a dark void of nothingness I think that all this time I had just been looking for a good reason to actually kill myself and right now all I can think about is how big of a failure as a person I am Even my therapist has been pressuring me to finish my thesis and graduate and then focus on my problems during summer but I just cannot deal with all this pressure and all the negative thoughts that have been stopping me from being productive this last year So yeah I am ashamed but this is it Hopefully I can make this stop the fastest way possible Thank you for reading this and sorry for taking up your time You all deserve the best,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High
I feel numbI m the person people go to if no one else is available and I can t blame them All I do lately is complain about my problems because they keep getting worse and it s gotten to the point where I can t enjoy life anymore I feel like I m letting everyone down all the time I hate what I ve become I used to be witty clever and fun but now I m just a black hole that absorbs other peoples energy It feels like I ve lost the ability to feel true happiness I feel like my life ended when my childhood ended Everything I did after childhood were just failed attempts at feeling good again Lately I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot Then I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment I get the urge to physically punish myself Sometimes I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg Sometimes I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out although it has nearly killed me once in the past After a while the emotions pass on and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing until the cycle repeats I ve lost interest in all the things I liked to do Nothing brings me joy anymore The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint but the feeling passes quickly and then I go back to feeling like shit I think about suicide at least a couple of times a day but I can t kill myself cause there are people who actually care about me I sometimes lose control over my actions though so I m scared I might actually try again I ve attempted suicide times throughout my late teens while I was heavily struggling with drugs but luckily I never succeeded I haven t had a proper diagnose yet but I have all the symptoms of bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder The bipolar symptoms have been present all my life The others slowly developed over time I have a first appointment with a psychiatrist this week I doubt that talking alone will help much though I m hoping that medication will help me feel better I probably should change some things in my life but I can t do that as long as I feel the way I do now,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
Dear reddit after taking a look at my life I realized that I have no one to talk to and that I was instead the one others come to for solace and comfort so now that I need that there are none who are willing to offer it I have nobody not even the person who shares mutual love with me wishes to spend some time with me and at least hear me out now because of my mood Speaking of moods I m in a fairly dangerous one Not for others mind you I don t believe in harming other people for no good reason My mood is hazardous to my own health Most days I m suicidal anyway but most days I have some level of hesitation or disinterest in death and serious issues with pain Today I find myself quite lacking in caution self preservation instinct and the ability to care whether or not I live or die On top of all this I have work in about hours and I m not even sure I can make it all the way there without dying spectacularly EDIT Oh right lest we forget the biggest reason I can t talk to anyone is because they re all as messed up as I am and adding to their worries will only cause more of a headache for me and is exactly the same as adding to my own problems especially if I decide to stick around It s a crappy loop that screws me over time,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

To whoever is thinking about suicide and sees this Even if it feels you are alone that no one understands you that you are so worthless to the point that the world is better off without you Just stop And think clearly about what you are doing There are many people that would be sad to see you go like that Even if you don t know that One of your family or friends pets some complet stranger that you accidentally smiled to and helped them relive their stress or even one of your fellow redditors that are kind enough to care about you I know i do Even though i never knew you Knowing that a human died when i could have stopped that with a few words of encouragement would surely bring me over my breaking point Well just make sure to think about everyone that would love to help you before you do anything you might not live to regret Please,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting poetic justice Is that the right term This is what I mean As far as I know my school s never had a suicide If anyone should kill themselves not that anyone should it should be me It would have the biggest effect if it was me It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn t be SURPRISED I was very severely bullied every day for years by people and about at once The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it I was the most hated person in the year maybe even the school for NO REASON Or at least nothing in my control Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity I have been depressed for about the last years And I have very very few friends and no social life at all Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me I just burst into tears writing this I didn t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for years If I killed myself all those kids would think She really did it and would say WE drove her to this and kids at neighbouring schools would say You know my name who got picked on She committed suicide and A girl from my school killed herself And Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd thinking Oh it s my name so it s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it s nothing and now she s dead Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe definitely reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double Maybe that was my purpose after all Also no one would care if I wasn t there I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout GET OUT LARA NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE in such a sincere way They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there No one really cares about me Or maybe they all care just not enough The only way people would care about me is if I was dead Similarly I ve been thinking what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all forever I don t want to stall too much so that I ve left school when I do it because then the school won t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn t because of them I don t want the wrong people to be blamed I don t know how much longer I can go on It s like a candle is burning and I don t know how much is left of it height but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn t much It wouldn t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

Just exhausted of continually feeling this way and it s not bound to get any better The past months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me In the time that s passed I ve experienced the following Experienced the end of my first adult love leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me and even if they did they d just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway Lost the majority of my friends after this and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I ve been reluctant to reach out to them Almost didn t graduate from college but barely got by and found myself neck deep in student loan debt Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another This has gotten to the point where I don t even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use Also generally work graveyard hours but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful frequent headaches Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day to a point where I just don t want to deal with it anymore I m just so tired and I can t see this getting any better The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened but as time passed I started leaning more towards it quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won t have to see them because it always ends the same way with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances I don t have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I ve regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back I did want to further my education but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring I think I m at my breaking point I don t know what to do and I don t want to tolerate this anymore I know I m on the younger end of the spectrum and there s the unknown that s waiting for me or whatever but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once I hate to think of using it as an easy way out but at this point I really just don t want to deal with the pain depression and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

Why are people so quick to jump on the pro life wagon every time someone mentions suicide First response anytime suicide is mentioned is call a crisis line or get help or etc What really is so bad about taking one s life aside from potentially hurting family friends if you even have any Personally suicidal thoughts are the only thing that get me through the week I think to myself that I ll do it Saturday night and I just bide my time till then It makes me feel relieved inside to think about not having to deal with anything anymore Only thing stopping is me is being scared of actually doing it But as each weekend goes by I get closer to overcoming the fear So why can t other people especially strangers give their blessing when someone expresses their wish to die rather than try and talk them out of it right away,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

I m trying so hard to get betterTo start off if I could only receive constructive comments and no I relate to that I feel the same way etc because I can t handle the weight of other people s struggles right now because I can t even handle my own Thank you I ve deal with mental health struggles for as long as I can remember My mom told me I had my first anxiety attack at age There s never really been anything bad happening in my life It s always been within me Which makes it even harder sometimes because unlike a certain event or situation you will always be with yourself and your thoughts I ve been in therapy since th grade I m now in th but I definitely could ve used it sooner I ve been through many ups and downs in the past years and I recently came out as transgender female to male which has made my life so much more complicated I lost my friends since childhood and then another group of friends I stopped going to traditional public school this year I ve self harmed been clean and relapsed I thought I was doing better until a few months after I left outpatient at the start of the summer Everyone says I ve been making really good progress over the years but I ve never been this close to suicide on a daily basis I can t deal with my gender identity I m constantly doubting wether I m trans but simultaneously experiencing crippling gender dysphoria I m disassociating really hard every day I ve experienced disassociation since middle school but never for this long or this intense I don t even recognize my face body voice or even the things I say or the way I act I feel like a shell of the person I last remember being Even taking a step back to analyze my thinking I can t even comprehend who s thoughts they are I ve stopped talking to people about the fact that I no longer experience a will to live because no one can do anything about it it just hurts others and makes me feel more hopeless I ve always felt like there s something else wrong with me that hasn t been diagnosed but maybe that s the hypochondria Thus far I ve only been diagnosed with Anxiety OCD and Depression I haven t self harmed in awhile but it s just because I know it doesn t really help and hurts those around me The only way I can describe it is that I m a cicada I have a shell on the outside that I ve shed a few times but now I m stuck in one shell I no longer exist to the outside world just the shell of whatever state of being I felt connected to last I don t even feel like a person anymore I have no idea who I am even on the deepest level I ve been on autopilot for so long I ve tried to get better for so long I can t remember a time that I wasn t mentally struggling It feels like life will never be different for me it s like that s just how god designed me I m tired of people telling me it ll get better it won t be like this forever you can keep going This is all I ve ever known Mental turmoil with short periods of feeling ok And I can t see any possible way out No matter where I go or where I run the problem is in my head I can t escape it I can only distract from it for a short amount of time I can t even remember to eat sometimes now I forget to do the most basic things I can never make decisions so I m probably not gonna kill myself anyway It s too much to plan and I know I ll probably forget something important It s permanent and drastic and I don t do well with making permanent drastic decisions I m just hoping someone will finally say something that clicks for more than a few days or I ll suddenly realize something or I ll find something that lets me see the light at the end of the tunnel Feel free to ask questions even if they re personal I m desperate,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

I can t speak Ever since I was a child I ve had a stutter Not a mild one think of the Kings Speech that one hits closer to home I spent my school life listening to everyone chat laugh sing whisper but could never do it myself I would sit in the classroom at my allocated spot at the table hearing questions being thrown out to the room which I knew the answer to and beyond all other wanting in that moment all I craved was to raise my hand and answer it like a normal school boy would I just couldn t Instead I would sit there within my impenetrable silent bubble I d found myself in and daydream of a future where I would become an adult and have a happy life my stutter non existent Ten years later I m an adult with a medicore job with some great friends of whom I m very lucky to have My family friends and colleagues all know of my affliction but as they do not have one themselves all they see is someone with a mundane speech impediment who needs a little longer to get his words out They and I assume most people who can speak fluently and articulatory without hindrance don t understand or realise the mental and emotional turmoil it can create In this day and age everything is based around communication Want to apply for a job Sit down for an hour in front of two people and answer questions on you why you want to spend your free precious time filling up the cheeses on aisle six for pennies Need cancel a subscribion Buy a house doctors appointment Give them a ring only to have them hang up when they think that nobody is there because you can t say a simple Hello Or perhaps you want to go to the shops to buy a new coffee machine when the nice lady walks up to you and asks you if you need any help today completely unaware of the battle which is raging deep down inside of you Struggling to breathe facial contortions colour shifting from milky white to beetroot red Being so aware of every millisecond that passes and just before the words come out finally you realise that she is looking at you funny with a hint of fear It s degrading Humiliating Demasculating Knowing that I am of sound mind just trying to get by with life but whenever I need to speak to someone they think something is wrong in my head and avoid me I go from the friendly looking chap standing by the toasters to someone they regret walking over to because I am not acting normal And worse of all The hardest thing for me to say is stutter So I can t even tell people what s going on so they never realise Every waking hour of my life is dedicated to my stutter It s always there looming behind every choice I make It s an invisible disease eating away at confidence from the inside out until a shallow husk remains filled only with anxiety with lost dreams and opportunities If this is to be my life then it is not worth living Watching peers around you progress and move up to a better life when I can t even make a phone call without being hung up on Suicide has always been in a different reality to me Seemed too far away or unrealistic to see it properly However as time goes on I can only see a very bleak future for me in this life I don t think it will be very long now until I take the plunge,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High
I tried to kill myself the other nightI don t really know how to talk about this Right now my kids are playing and being cute and the conflict of disgust for myself at my attempt to leave them and the disgust that they deserve someone better than their shit mommy is mingled up I feel sick because I haven t eaten again too But it doesn t make a difference I m still fat I m not losing weight My attempt was as pathetic and stupid as I am I tried to run outside naked in degree snowy weather and throw myself into water I didn t even make it outside My husband wrestled me to the ground first while I was screaming like a banshee The bruises are a reminder of how pathetic I am I ve been married for six years I ve been in a poly relationship with my boyfriend for four Ex boyfriend Yeah look at the drama queen having a breakdown over her worthless ex My husband is an INTJ He loves me deeply but he s terrible at showing it He s very neurotic read the wikipedia article for Neuroticism and you ve got his biography He s also the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac His upbringing was conservative Christian style abusive and he reacts in a volatile manner to almost everything I m ESFJ I try to keep everyone happy but I guess I m shit at it I rarely clean because I m always tired Keeping him calm when the kids lose it is a strain Keeping myself calm when the kids lose it is a strain Some days I just can t anymore Those are the days we fight He loves me he works very hard for our family I just feel very lonely and not understood Or that he even tries to understand He just wants the fight to stop but also to win it To explain to me with anger skewed logic how I m wrong nomatter what in the heat of a fight When not in a fight he still doesn t know how to do things make me happy even though we ve been married for six years Even though I know how to make him happy I ve tried to tell him sweet things to try he ll do it for a day or two then forget I feel so lonely At some point I d started cutting but rarely Maybe once every few months then a year or two between Four years ago my husband had had a girlfriend on Second Life for awhile and I d been ok with it our marriage had been rocky and it kept him from harassing me for sex so much He had encouraged me to talk to guys there too I met my boyfriend by roleplaying on Second Life and the connection was instantaneous and intense We talked for hours and hours and hours the first few days He understood me the way he thought made sense We had the same interests liked the same games liked the same themes My husband was jealous that we had so much in common but he was getting a lot more sex so he didn t complain much My boyfriend was my social life I told him everything though I told him too much so many times its probably what killed it at some point or another We moved around a lot so I wasn t able to meet up with him until the very end of those four years Well after he was already over me though he always said that he loved me We kept moving then I got pregnant He was sure I d disappear but I didn t No one would hire me pregnant I became a stay at home mother before I even had the baby Childcare would cost the same as me working my ass off at part time jobs just to pay for someone else to raise my children for me My husband hurried and got a job in NYC and we moved to a shitty part of NJ when I was months pregnant The birth was traumatic for me the doctors were horrible to me and bullied me into a cesarean I probably didn t need The new baby was colicky and miserable My husband s job was hell the commute was hell I was alone all day with a miserable baby and my online boyfriend Then the job cut everyone s already spectacularly low pay down by We lost our apartment I had to move in with his control freak hyper conservative christian mother borderline fundamentalist My husband had to move in with a friend for a longer commute for shit pay while the new boss they assigned when the old one quit screamed at his three person department in front of the entire office He had sleep apnea and wasn t sleeping He was in hell His mother is a hoarder I was crammed in a tiny basement filled to the ceiling with bullshit and an extreme mold problem that made everyone sick I had my tiny miserable colicky baby down there while failing at breastfeeding and was in pumping hell He would cry all night and refuse to eat and I had to be chained to a breast pump I was supposed to be illustrating a children s book I hated I eventually finished it but it took months and I still don t like looking at it Talking to Seth was hell I needed help and relief and so did he and we had none to give We would be snappy and miserable at each other So I stopped talking to him My boyfriend was the only thing that got me through it I talked to him a ridiculous amount I was nocturnal to avoid a large portion of everyone s unending stress and talked to him while I tried to work He loved me then dearly He got so much attention and we would spend hours and hours talking and roleplaying and just being together It was unrealistic Then my husband would make the hour long commute to our apartment from work on fridays then the three hour commute to his parents to get there around pm He would be tired and angry and snappy He didn t want to look at the baby We would almost always fight He was miserable and I was miserable and he was jealous He didn t have his girlfriend anymore It was the ugliest time in our relationship It was the ugliest time in my life except for now I think Eventually he quit the hell job and we immediately moved in with my parents because living with his was hell on earth My boyfriend didn t manage well Suddenly that constant attention was pulled I couldn t be on calls much at all I had less childcare and I was severely depressed My husband jealously tried to keep me away from the computer too after I had abandoned him for my boyfriend those six months It was rocky For awhile my boyfriend railed against it fought to have me back like we were before Even if my husband hadn t be jealous that could never happen Not without leaving my husband and through it all I didn t want to I still loved him He couldn t ask me to but I know my boyfriend wished I would Its a natural selfish thing we all do I d been unfair and told him things I shouldn t have told him when I was hurt and when I was angry with my husband It wasn t business to share I d planted strife between them I d always held this naive belief that my boyfriend would love me forever He d pulled away gotten a lot more quiet He didn t respond to everything I said anymore instead I d be writing pages to myself That was around two years in My husband got a job a new job in Pittsburgh We moved for the fifth time in the years I d known my boyfriend We got an apartment I wanted to fly him up but money was tight from all the moving and we were behind on everything Also having a yr old toddler was tough and my relationship was still strained with my husband My boyfriend was around probably out of the same lonliness I was suffering from We were making plans to meet Then I found out I was pregnant again A failed IUD that had been put in incorrectly Who knows if I d been unprotected for a year or if it had moved somehow I ll never know It was dangerous They tried to get me to abort immediately just to be safe but I refused I had to be monitored for a month to make sure I wasn t in danger of ectopic pregnancy Once I was out of danger my boyfriend became cynical and distant He was sneaking around on Second Life with random people e clubs He still played games with me and playing some Warhammer roleplaying games with him and friends revived it a bit I tried to fly him up but became violently ill with morning sickness and he cancelled the flight when I said I couldn t do it I m pretty sure that was the moment it was really over The pregnancy was miserable My husband doesn t do well with small children at all Baby cries make him panic and respond unreasonably and he constantly talked about how awful it would be to have a baby and a toddler together Even though I talked throughout the day every single day my boyfriend was also distant and uncaring He d offhandedly mentioned meeting a girl but her husband had been so jealous it only lasted a couple of days I wasn t carrying a baby it seemed I was carrying a nuclear bomb It was a long lonely miserable pregnancy I cried so much When the baby finally came I had to have another cesarean this time because I d been sitting in a shitty broken chair for years that screwed up the alignment of my pelvis It was my fault You can t have a trip with a new baby You can t have your boyfriend up when your body is shitty and you re breastfeeding While family is constantly in and out While my life was hell At least I d thought so I should ve just let him in I m practical to a fault but I don t think he was even that interested at that point We still talked every day We played games together I tried to make it through my lonely stressful life I held onto him and he was sort of there but I railed against the distance that was so plain Finally we made plans The baby was finally old enough to stay away for a few days We would get together at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh where we live My husband s girlfriend would come up to meet him too a girl he wasn t much into anymore either but wanted to give a chance Just weeks before the trip my boyfriend had a heart attack It was the true end because when he wrote about it on his FA and that girl from before attached herself to him He began talking to her constantly more than me Roleplaying with her doing all the things he did with me when our relationship had been new She was married too She just didn t have children He talked to her for months She began posting pictures of their characters fucking She told me to my e face that it wasn t like that and she respected my relationship meanwhile she wrote all over her tumblr about her new boyfriend I d postponed the trip to October for him to heal It was for two weeks It was pleasant but he was distant and had issues making love to me He spent a lot of time on his phone The second week my husband s girlfriend came up and there was trick or treat and I took the kids to zoo boo and a hallow birthday party for my boyfriend and a friend of mine It was chaotic and my husband had a breakdown because he didn t know how to deal with the jealousy but felt too guilty to leave his girlfriend for long enough to get comfort for me We had a fight where we had to talk it out It was awkward The rest of the trip was ok but the second week was stressful and messy I d made a bad choice in timing and by adding the girlfriend It was too much At Christmas I found out that they were together She posted pictures of her and her husband and him all nude in their furry forms cuddling together I got very upset Then I got dumped I cried I was told at first that I had been chosen The pictures came down We got each other Christmas gifts Then they all reappeared And he chose her I spiraled It was the worst Christmas of my life I spent hours on the phone with him The first few times were sweet and caring Eventually he couldn t keep the facade up anymore He plastered her on his profile immediately I cut myself Five stripes to numb the drowning feeling At some point before then I d figured out that a clean razor stored in a sterile bottle would cut cleanly enough to give me a dose of adrenaline that would numb an episode of drowning It wouldn t make me feel good but it would get my head above water until I just existed in a cold lonely world instead of drowning in a chaotic whirlpool of hurt I took a break from the computer Stopped taking commissions and withdrew to try to get through the holiday I bought a bunch of games on steam and spent a lot of time playing them with my husband He was happy to have me back and since I wasn t outwardly being miserable he assumed I was all better A month of back and fourth with my boyfriend still trying to play games together but his platitudes wearing thin and his promises falling through again and again Then she posts about how he had visited her In November Immediately after seeing me I d been cheated on in the flesh I found out about a week and a half ago I called him I cried a little but I was mostly numb He didn t sound very sorry about it I told him if he wanted me around he would have to talk to me He said he would He barely tried I cut again Four stripes to breathe Then a few days later he leaves to go see her He s at her house right now Fucking her I was stupid I kept looking at his profile on FA As long as things weren t being posted maybe it was going badly Then the flood of blissfully happy images appeared He knew I was following him so even if I hadn t been checking they all flooded my feed I doubt I even crossed his mind when he did it Imagine if someone got a divorce then a month later when his ex found out she d been cheated on he starts plastering his facebook with images of him and his new gf together It was the final blow I ve never felt so ugly so fat so useless in my life or so alone My artwork is constantly surpassed by others and its my own fault for not spending more time on it The time I do spend is away from my children My house is a shitpile because I don t clean When he posted all that I went upstairs upset and sad I was angry and tired I told him what happened and he scolded me for looking at his profile I snapped I told him to say loving words or to shut the fuck up He didn t like it he kept shoving his advice down my throat and I got more and more hysterical I ran downstairs I ve threatened suicide so many times in my hysteria during our echo chamber fights he didn t even follow Then I slammed the silverware drawer and he angrily yelled down at me and ran downstairs I told him to fuck off He tore into me verbally I tore back We worked each other up until I was done I was betrayed and heartfucked by one asshole and would be spending a life with the other who would never ever be able to lick my wounds to actually care Just fucking correct until I gave in I ran for the door I was naked I tried to get it open but he stopped me I ran for the other He stopped me again I ran a third time and got it halfway open he overpowered me and wrestled me to the floor while I screamed and screamed He held me down until I gave up I should ve gone to the hospital but I didn t He stayed home the next day to make sure I wouldn t do anything I asked my ex to call me he said he would then he didn t I m not worth it I m not worth bothering with I m not worth figuring out what I need because why bother on a fat waste of air I m so sad Sorry for the life story It doesn t really tell that my husband is a good person that my boyfriend was too He said so many sweet things but his actions do a lot to prove how false they were That my kids are smart and beautiful but extremely stressful Some days I don t know how to keep going The house is getting steadily more disgusting I m getting snappy

I think I just made suicidal gesture Okay So I m in grad school and it really sucks I m really not into the idea of going into academia but I don t want to quit I love my discipline and let s be real I have nothing else going for me That said I can t stand my peers or the faculty I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further given the cost I got into a language program that would be great for my CV but financially speaking I just can t afford to support myself through the summer Outside of loans I m on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don t do this I will not get my degree My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning I have no clue what to do I don t want to give up my degree but I really really HATE my program If I stay I ll be miserable if I go I ll hate myself for quitting I know what your thinking but transferring in grad school is easier said than done Last night I got into a really big argument with my parents It wasn t so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself A few hours later after I got done studying I was really upset I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it So I took my belt off fastened it around my neck tied it to a rack in my closet not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head but either I didn t think it would work or I chickened out I don t really know which it was I took it off and just went to bed So I guess my question is did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it I don t want my parents to worry about me I don t want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation But I also don t think this is something I should brush under the rug,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

Most days my brain is just silently AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIt s like this indescribable emotional pain mixed with an intense almost overwhelming desire for life to end all resulting in a feeling as if there s a corner of my brain just screaming endlessly TL DR Shoutout to everyone here trying to get on with life with a brain that wants to die Posting here because I can t act anymore I can t pretend that everything is okay I ve gained kg in a week from eating rubbish which is super yuck but I also don t care because my brain has been swamped by intense suicidal ideation and if I m not sufficiently distracted the thoughts about suicide come back in like BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM just drowning out everything else I think about self harming a lot I mean not only suicide but other forms of physical pain But then I remember I ve got way too many scars already and additional scars and a high pain tolerance doesn t change anything I don t have a good reason to want to die There s no major crisis The relationship breakdown was over months ago and I m mostly over that I have enough money for everything I essentially need Sure I ll probably need several more major operations because genetics suck and I ll definitely need a double mastectomy at some point because cancer risk but that s not it either It s not even the fact that I have about three friends and the last time I hung out with a friend was in February because at the moment people are too exhausting for me to want to have any interaction with I don t want anything to do with anyone right now I can t pretend to not be depressed when I m around other people anymore It takes all of my energy to pretend to be normal and smile and laugh at work and I know I don t do a very good job at that as it is It s not really any of that I just don t care anymore About any of it Any of life I am amazed I have been together enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth and pay bills and work days a week Do look pale and run down as shit though Going through the motions I guess while my brain is screaming I want to die all the while It s gotten to the point where I m thinking about suicide all day every day I suspect it s the general anaesthetic I had from a colonoscopy in May sending me off the deep end into post operative depression but also the general state of the world Now I know if I stopped eating crap and did more exercise and got more sunshine and made more of an effort to be social I d probably feel better But it also gets to a point where you cannot bring yourself to do any of that because just getting dressed and maintaining basic personal hygiene is a mammoth achievement So I am going to my GP on Monday to ask to go back on antidepressants It might be a complete waste of time and money as it has been in the past but I can t help hoping that this time will be different that this time maybe we ll try a different drug that might actually give me the capacity to overcome the intrusive suicidal thoughts and do the exercise and the things I know I need to do for wellbeing Also going to see the psychologist on Monday It s been difficult to get an appointment a because it s bloody expensive and b because a huge chunk of the general population are under huge stresses so she s super busy and hard to get into I m hoping I have the money to continue to see her because she s the best psychologist I have ever seen I haven t kept it up because of financial stress and my mental health has suffered as a result But I think this time I should be able to stick with it for a while It s been hard because the depression has screwed with my cognitive function and sleep again too I can t concentrate for more than seconds I m agitated and drowning in anxiety all the time I go to sleep late and wake up early whether I like it or not I can t remember anything and everything takes me ten times longer to process or understand than usual and I constantly feel as dumb as a rock I wasn t entirely honest with my doctor last time I went because I didn t want to be on antidepressants again and I sure as hell didn t want to run the risk of being put in a mental hospital again But at the moment it s gotten to the point where I just don t care about anything anymore so might as well be totally upfront I think I m too lazy to actually kill myself Having been there and tried that more than once getting it right takes a lot of planning and organising and logistics I just don t have the energy for Especially because were I to go through with one of the plans for suicide I have I don t want to leave all my stuff just around for my family to deal with I d need to sort out my belongings and affairs etc etc etc and make sure I had enough money to cover any potential funeral or medical expenses if I fucked it up And that s the nub of it Human beings are both incredibly resilient and incredibly fragile creatures I think what keeps me going at times like these is that I know if I failed suicide where I was left half brain dead and still aware that that would be a fate far worse than this My life could be x worse than it currently is no doubt But knowing that doesn t change that incessant suicidal impulse blamming it s way across my brain I just wanted to put this out there because I needed to tell someone how I feel right now with completely

Work pressure and mental tormentHello to all I struggled with suicidal thoughts throughout my entire college years I studied medicine in Germany and work as junior cardiologist in a challenging top tier university research hospital here in Germany I am getting bullied by my colleagues and mentally tormented I failed at many research projects and get bullied heavily because of this I am have no social interactions besides going to work and the gym I have no friends never had a girlfriend or any kind of physical contact to the opposite sex The worst part is my work and all my failed projects I just do not enjoy life I know that many people here are in worse and more precarious situations but I do not want to exist I hate every moment The only reason why I am living is my family and brother I do not want them to feel sad when I die I just do not want to exist because I hate life and my existence itself,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High
Suicide is selfish permanent solution to a temporary problem Bullshit I have heard these for years It drives me fucking insane I find it amazing people don t see the blatant hypocrisy They think it is selfish for someone to kill themselves and put their family through pain But somehow they don t see it as selfish that they expect someone who is suffering to keep living so that their family or friends don t have to suffer through the loss Like really as if it is isn t enough of a shitty deal to be depressed and suicidal they have to stick you with the guilt of being selfish for wanting to just be done with it all Unreal And I m the selfish one Oh and my other favorite Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem Yeah ok Spoken like someone who has no idea what chronic depression is like There is nothing temporary about it It is forever You might get some brief breaks from it but it s never gone for good,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

The inertia s finally running outI ve spent the last or so years suppressing my desire to kill myself to finally die and not have to deal with any of this shit anymore and I don t even know why I don t know why I ve kept going until this point other than the fact that I m too poor to buy a gun I dream about it I fantasize about it It s the only remaining thing I have to look forward to my job is a dead end I m not going to college I have no real friends nothing to make me want to stick around I m beyond the point where this is just a quick escape from a bad situation my life has been shitty and pointless for years now and I m sick of coasting along just because I can t bring myself to do anything else I m unwilling to put the time and effort into spending years in college to maybe change something or to try and find a new shitty job that pays just as little that amounts to nothing more than a change of scenery or to find someone to talk to about this to try and hear them explain why my life is a precious thing I shouldn t waste or some shit like that I m just sick of this There is not a single aspect of my life that appeals to me in any way any longer and I m tired of staying in a world I don t want to be part of just because it s expected of me I just want to end this I ve dragged it out long enough already I don t stand to gain anything by continuing in this grain all that ll happen is I ll just postpone it even longer Hell I don t even know why I m bothering to post this because at the end of the day I m just gonna force myself to go to work in a few hours like nothing s wrong then come home to dream about finding a loaded gun again I don t want to be talked out of it I don t have any way to do it in the first place I guess I m just doing this because this is the kind of thing suicidal people are supposed to do I genuinely don t care if any of you are interested in trying to talk me out of this I just feel like saying shit that there s no way I could say under my real name,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

I don t think there s anything more depressing than finding yourself on the way to the hospital after a suicide attempt and realizing you don t even have anyone to tell Cut too deep on my way to the hospital to get stitches Second suicide attempt this month I m already at a residential treatment center but clearly it s not working Sitting in the car with a staff member I don t know and realizing I have no one to text to let them know that I m on my way to the hospital How depressing is that,"Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High
I am not well I was blessed with a NASA internship that I feel I have no right to a loving family etc But I am closer to suicide than I think I ve been most of my life I ve planned twice Those were my lowest points so far But this pit I m in right now is unfathomable I don t know how to get out I am surrounded by smiles but they don t listen when I say I m in trouble They say I m sorry Or i hope you find a way around meds to help yourself Or you re so smart and capable You ll be fine But I m not fine I feel like I m screaming in a glass enclosed room and they re just not seeing me I don t know what to do but I feel so immensely alone The worst part is that I know I have people to reach out to I m just not sure if I can handle platitudes anymore I m tired I m so tired,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

Difficult thoughtsSo I m in one of my crisis and just came across here while trying to find something to get my mind off of everything So I guess I ll just post away and hopes it helps a bit So I had a friend She commited suicide in and I got to know only in I was in my last year of high school when I discovered and I had a fight with her Stupid reasons really Mostly not agreeing on stuff that really wasn t important When I tried to talk to her again to apologize or something I got the news It was heartbreaking and I wish I could have done something anything I mean we were both pretty alone at life really And just like that a person that was one of my only friends was gone just like that Nothing I could feel other than the pain it left that I could never talk to her again That all I have now is fucking memories So you d think due to my experience that I d learn something I don t know But even all those years later I just did not forgive myself I m not particularly alone and I KNOW there are people that care That they are with me and all that Still even when people say that I m worth it or whatever I can t seem to believe it All that comes through my mind is how much I fucked everything up for basically nothing and how nothing I could ever do would revert that It s so stupid but yet every once in a while it becomes so heavy and I just don t know what to do I think that I m not worth it That it d be better if everything came to a stop But yet I do believe in the words of the few people that say they care no matter how hollow they seem when I think about it Basically yeah I don t know Honestly I just feel like utter shit and usually I tank this shit alone as I ve always did And I see where it takes me I just wait and see like the stupid coward I am Anyway I m sorry about this I m not sure it all made sense but this is how I m feeling this is how I usually feel when late night comes around and I can t just so something to make it go away Anyway I m sorry if this bothered anyone I just needed to let this out in a different place in a place where I don t have the certainty people will just say that I should let it go already,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

Not really suicidal just depressed For a while a couple of years I have been getting more and more depressed However I m very good at hiding it so the only people who know are my close friends who cared enough to listen to my stoned rants about how shitty my life is Actually that s not true My life is great compared to a lot of people my family rocks I have a decent amount of money I m in college and good friends But there is one thing that has been missing from my life a relationship I m basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl I m now and it s awkward to admit I have a girl I kind of like who I work with but she s from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopes I really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am but I don t want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist They have enough worries without worrying about me I know they would give me all the help in the world but I just can t bring myself to telling them about it Every time my Mom randomly asks Are you O K I think for a second to say no and tell her everything But instead I smile say Of course Mom and move on with my life Anyways I just wanted to vent here because I know the people here will listen It actually really helps to type out my feelings like this,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High
A Meaningless RantHonestly I don t know how to properly put this into words but I feel the need to so I can get some proper sleep rn I have no goals I m a Christian without faith and can t find the point to living anymore I m years old and have never felt more tired in my life in Uni as my daily life drains me more and more And I ask myself every bloody day what s the point of being here I want to die to begin with but I had to have the typical fear of maiming and surviving This isn t a new question it s been haunting me for about years and I don t know how to get any drive back nor has my life improved The coffee doesn t help nor does the medicine I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and they re necessary skills trades But why bother with it when your suicidal the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily I m just taking a random course to begin with so I don t even know why I m even going to uni probably to just meet expectations It s not that I have no one I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know it s a privilege But I just can t seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes In conclusion I guess I wanted to come out and rant to a bunch a strangers about it since I don t know how my friends or non family would take it I ve told my parents that I am in fact suicidal weeks ago they took it well a bit too calmly idk nothing has changed in our relationship for better or worse Ps sorry for the poorly flowing sentences I haven t seen my class on how to write a proper suicidal rant,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High

Concerned for a friend our conversation has left me shaken up I want to start from the beginning I apologize early on if the information is not needed I will try to get to our conversation that just happened a few minutes ago quickly Sorry if the formatting and paragraphing is weird I play online video games quite a lot This has led me to meet plenty of people who come in and out of my life a lot Except for one of my friends who we will call James We have talked and played together for a little over a year now This has caused a pretty good relationship to grow between us We text call each other and even video chat on the occasion James is and lives in another state than I Because we have grown so close we talk a lot about things that happen in real life and about our pasts He mentioned to me that he has attempted suicide before but was saved and generally during our relationship he was never depressed or has ever shown any signs that he is still feeling like killing himself It all started a about months ago when he got together with this woman they dated for a few weeks and he made her pretty happy He often makes the mistake of falling to quickly and deeply in love When they broke up he was very depressed the only time we would ever talk was when he was completely intoxicated We went through a period where he would never answer calls or texts from me even Finally some good things happened in his life that brought him up and we were talking again Just weeks ago he decided to try dating again He met a girl via a dating app They talked non stop which made him smile and laugh and REALLY made a difference in him that even I could see from a few states away They met each other in person as she only lived an hour away from him and everything was going great He was talking about how much he loved her I don t know if he told her that and how she could be the one he marries I didn t want to ruin his fun as it was nice to see him happy so I did not say anything to him about how soon it was to make statements like that They broke up yesterday He had text me very early in the morning when I was sleeping and I didn t get the text for another hours All it said was I need someone right now I felt terrible because somehow I knew what happened I gave him a call no answer I text him no answer so I called him again and he answered saying he was at a friends getting drunk I asked if he was okay and he explained to me what happened They broke up because her mom told her she didn t want them to be together He pretty much hung up on me so I decided to give him space as he clearly didn t want to talk about it Today when I asked him if he wanted to play any games I didn t want to bug him about what happened He said he would so we got on and played for about minutes before he left to go play a different game After a few hours he called and sounded extremely intoxicated He asked to play so I hopped on the game and joined him I asked him if he was drunk he said he was I could tell This is where it gets to our conversation I asked why he was drinking so much he explained that he has felt like he was having a heart attack all day and yesterday He was slurring his speech making incoherent sentences etc Then he very casually says he wants to blow his brains out It took me by surprise and I asked him why He says he was in pain saying that he wants to end it so he no longer feels how he is anymore I got more and more concerned as he spoke I had no idea what to say I know for a fact that he has the means and intent to do something like that so I asked him if he was serious why he was going to do it He said he was serious and said he wanted to end his pain and that he didn t deserve to live anymore I tried to tell him that I care about him and that I would miss him his family and friends would etc Anything I could think of to say to him He just shot everything down saying he hates everyone and that his family and friends including me could fuck off and go to hell because he will be dead and won t have to deal with the consequences of his death I pretty much was left crying my eyes out left not knowing what to say All I could say was your life matters to me and I would be upset if you died After repeatedly saying he didn t care he finally says do you think if I was actually going to kill myself I would be sitting here talking to you No i wouldn t be He basically started to lash out against me and I had nothing left to say He had shrugged off anything I could think of to say Right now I am heading off to work and said he could call me and I would talk to him if he needed or wanted to talk He didn t respond and just logged off of the game Hasn t answered my texts or calls It s not my fault I have to go to work and can t listen to him calling me a whore for the rest of the night But I did offer to listen while I was at work I honestly have no idea what to do anymore I m not sure how serious his threats were and I have no idea where he lives no contact other than his cell phone number I don t know if I should reach out to his family members on Facebook or if that would cause more damage,"Cause of Distress, Critical

Thoughts about suicide became everyday routineThis is happening during last years It started pretty weak I thought about suicide once in a month but then it became worse and worse I already had real suicide attempts which ended up in reanimation Actual planning of suicide and not such successful attempts were way more than Today thoughts about suicide became my everyday routine before I go to sleep Sometimes this is the only thing that can make me fall asleep knowing that one day I will finally die and this all will end It make me feel calm I know this is sick I never wanted my life to be this way But this is how it is One thing that I wish more than anything is that one lucky day I will have real opportunity to do it When I ll be all alone and I ll be in right mood I ll drink some alcohol and hang myself P S Yes I recovered by depression with meds and therapist You can see that this didn t help Mental health care is very poor in my country So no one will help me I don t even know why I write it here just some kind of venting,Critical Risk,High

I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff have been unemployed for years so I will be choosing between suicide and very soon Open to unusual suggestions Just read the bold text as a TL DR if you want amp x B Background I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree German that I deeply regret in December The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues I have a little OCD some Borderline Personality Disorder traits and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis I have spent out of the years since I graduated unemployed It took me a year to find a job I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly That happened just eight months after I had left my parents house I didn t even make it a year on my own That was a year and a half ago I cannot find a fucking job I have tried everything amp x B The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree Over the past month for example I have applied to jobs and only made it to a nd round in person interview times So here we are amp x B I m ready to die I have a note and a plan amp x B I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the people who are part of my life behind I have read enough of r SuicideBereavement to know what it d do to them and I don t care most of the time amp x B My suicide method of choice is irreversible Guaranteed to kill me This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn t take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn t high enough I will be gone Thus I must be very certain about having no other options left amp x B Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you ll say why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents That is not something I can accept I didn t push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now there is no way I could work at Macy s or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself amp x B I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine amp x B At this point I don t know what the fuck I can do Here are the things that occur to me at this point in order from most reasonable to least amp x B Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a temp to permanent role that actually pans out The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house even if it is full time amp x B Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide amp x B Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language TEFL certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway I have a car that is worth around that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification amp x B Accept my suicide as inevitable living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else k gets you a long way in a third world country You may laugh at this but I m actually kind serious about this one amp x B Kill myself Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it That s it This miserable existence I never asked for would be over I have had sex fallen in love been to Europe enjoyed meaningful friendships done psychedelics Its been nice But I can t take this shit anymore at the same time Every day is the same Sitting at this fucking desk Miserable Insane Lonely Hopeless I think about suicide constantly amp x B Do you have any ideas for me What would you do amp x B,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk,

Never thought I d be having suicidal thoughts I don t really care that this is my main account I m currently camping with my four best friends in the world We planned this trip for ages and now it s actually happening but once again my mental illness ruins things for everyone Last night I freaked out because they wanted to go for a walk in the woods at midnight without phone signal and I was terrified they might die One of my friends gave me a much deserved talking to and said that the world shouldn t revolve around me which is of course right I shouldn t be controlling them it s just the anxiety talking I stayed up with my absolute best friend and another friend until three when we decided to go to bed However despite knowing I was in a fragile mental state my best friend decides to go off and leave me upset I messaged them asking just to chat because I was lonely to be told that I was making a big deal out of nothing and I should forget about it You can t just forget anxiety issues they re always there I cried myself to sleep then woke early this morning shaking Some mean part of me wanted to make them worry about me as much as I worry about them so I took my blanket and went for a long walk in the woods to see if I could spot some wild boar I got back after about an hour but noone had contacted me asking where I was even though I knew they were awake so I went and sat by the cafe and browsed reddit until one friend found me She said she d been looking everywhere for me and that my best friend was worried sick I was finally happy he actually cared When we got back to the tent he was asleep I don t know about you but when I m worried sick about someone I don t fall asleep until they re found I left again I m now sat by the cafe again crying my eyes out I m always there for them but I never feel like they care for me at all I m entertaining suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life maybe if I killed or seriously injured myself they d finally care about me I m tempted to make myself throw up right now so they might actually take me seriously I m a disgrace and everyone s fed up with me At least if I killed myself they d actually care,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",High
Is this actually DBT or is this just bad therapy for depression My therapist s response to I wish I could die without affecting anyone else was Well that s impossible Of course people who love you would miss you I would miss you It would be devastating That seems little short of guilt tripping I won t say it s totally ineffective but I kind of expected more from a DBT intensive therapist Or does DBT assume that the greatest motivation is positive attention Because it totally leverages the therapuetic relationship like it means more to me than anything else in the world Like Sorry you re ok and all but you re just my therapist I don t even know you Self harm has been officially unamed unacceptable and is punnishable by hours of no contact no phone coaching Phone coaching the thing they re supposed to try to get you to use instead of trying again to kill yourself If somebody s so desperate they re self harming possibly with intent to kill You can totally fix it by leveraging the need for continued attention against the need to feel better at any cost For the love of god why is there the assumption someone really just wants attention more than anything and if they get it for being good presenting as asymptomatic and not for being bad symptomatic they ll stop self harming or attempting suicide being symptomatic You cannot just manipulate me out of being suicidal That s not how this works I came to DBT for a robust empirically proven form of therapy that is supposedly heavy duty or industrial strength or whatever Supposedly perfect for severely depressed chronically suicidal people That s what I came for but I m not sure what it is that I m getting It assumes people are illogical attention motivated children above all else While I m not some mastermind genius I find that pretty insulting What do I get a gold star for each day without self harm too I know Let s go full out in behaviorism and do a token economy s I m studying psychology and neuroscience and this shit does not jive with what I ve been taught to expect of DBT I m disappointed really Flat out salty That and it s full of jargon that I can hardly begin to parse out My therapist says I need to work on my Committment to Living like it s a proper noun or something Oh and Mindfulness as a cure to everything including all misery of existence I don t like mindfulness I actually kind of hate it and the deep breathing bullshit too It doesn t work I don t like this toolkit I don t like this therapy and I hate this life Treatment resistant depressive Nothing works Not even a little,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

Let me explain to you why suicide is the best thing ever for ANYBODYSuicide is awesome Because suicide by definition is the intentional taking of own s life You take your own life Your actions do it Nature doesn t kill you you don t die just randomly no you fucking do it Isn t that awesome I think it is because death is fucking great and your own actions cause it I love death And today death is going to become reality for me I m really depressed and i have anxiety but i haven t told anyone Because i just don t see the point in it really What good would that do me I get help and i kill myself some other time Because that s just the way my brain is So fuck it Reddit Let s go out with a bang shall we I had this eternal struggle for a very long time and i made up my mind And i m happy because it s going to be over soon Reddit But Reddit i need to ask you something first Do you want to watch it My suicide Because if you do then yeah i can livestream it I don t care I know some people find it fucked up and not cool but a lot of people want to see it right So i m down Reddit i m down amp x B I m going to kill myself in a isolated place so i don t know when people will find my body if ever even That s the way i prefer I don t want to hurt people that are close to me Okay that sounded wrong i know i m going to hurt them if i disappear but it s not going to much of a mind fuck like a suicide would be At least that s what i think Anyway Reddit if you want to see it tell me and i ll make a post before i go live okay,"Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High
I want to die honorableI don t know if this is suicidal but I want to die in a way that I myself find glorious While I know I would never harm myself willingly I yet desire to cease existing But as the good nature in me calls for doing something good and helping others I want to die in a battle I would like to join some militia or organization that fights terror groups or generally saves other people so I could at least do something good for other people one last time before I leave And in case I don t die from that then great But I doubt it because I am not good I have never been to the military because my health problems are too much of a burden And where I live almost every male goes to the military at adult age So I also feel like I am missing out on something important even though I don t regret having to go there But yet perhaps that would make it up for this I mean someone without experience like me will die fast anyway right So doing something good and something I feel proud of while leaving with honorable actions is just the perfect setup Because else I am just a burden and non loved by anyone I cannot love myself because I can only do that if others love me as well I am the kind of person that depends on others I have to push myself and if I can t go on I just feel horrible For years I have tried following my dreams actually doing my best to achieve things in life but all failed Sure I tried and did my best there is nothing more I can do But this is exactly what bothers me If my best isn t enough to continue what else can I do You don t wanna see me try my worst if my best is already that horrible And I had enough always having to fight for things I never get in the end while others get it laid out on their hands Be it job and career or love life Sure I have friends and family I have a roof over my head and food on the plate But life is more than just surviving especially in these times where society expects much more of someone I often say I just wanna die but when I say I wanna die I really just mean I wanna finally start living and not just surviving like right now But the more days pass the more I think perhaps it actually is for the better if I do die Today it pushed me on the edge I had to hold a blade to my throat and chest for the first time in many many years To think I really be pushed that hard But I don t know why for some reason I still do have hope I kinda always have hope for something I cannot explain this phenomenon Even if I think I plan to die in battle I yet have hope to leave it alive and gaining new experience and mindset that could change me positively Even in such negativity I find positivity But this all is a double edged sword the one side that has hope that something good could happen but the other side that is right now a bit sharper than the other the side that just wants me to die Does anyone else feel like this Can you understand this And yes I am already trying to get help but I will not know the outcome in the end of all this,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",High

Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast presence Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television Just a disclaimer I am African American I m sharing an observation and this isn t an invitation for a racist discussion was a wild year when it came to racial injustice All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud Obviously companies see these protests and come out in support and that s fine But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students And many other commercials that you wouldn t usually see a black face on This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race I ve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are normal normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform Maybe I m reading too far into it but it s just what I noticed on television Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress It s upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when it s convenient to show that you support an agenda,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Not sure what to do My life feels like it s over Hi I was just directed to this sub I m not even sure where to begin I have mental problems memory issues so if there is a timeline discrepancy or everything is mixed up I m sorry I m also sorry for the length of the post You dont have to read it it s OK I m and have lived an incredibly dismal life As a child I lived with a single mom she had me when she was eighteen She had no aspirations and not much of an education So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life He was extremely cynical of me and would make me cry pretty well daily And for some reason I d cry until I vomited which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems It sucks pretty bad when you re eight years old and your own family won t believe you have heatburn It s like leaving me there to bleed out I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach By the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a special class for misbehaved students This was also in a catholic school It was an extremely hostile environment and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I ve ever heard But it s still happening to this day and damaging the lives of countless children The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn t very beneficial to a lot of the students The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there There were no tests to pass no work to be graded on You didn t even have to do anything In grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town they didn t have behavioral classes but I made so many friends and things were happy the days were bright Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy We moved in with him I made more friends everything was OK I went to school there were no problems They didn t have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Hey Lar home http i imgur com nD j jpg Your arms were the only ones in which I was truly loved and safe Yeah I get it your own parent not wanting you After you died Mom made it really clear I was a nuisance She left me with pedophiles more than one with me literally begging and screaming for her not to walk out that door while they sat there awaiting the pleasure they d take with me the second she left Even if she was in the next room or taking a quick shower I was the fuckdolly Did you know that one of them was at me for years Yeah he d kill my pets to keep me quiet Another one of her boyfriends Had my childhood dog EB for years he drowned her in the bathtub He killed several Told me Mom would hate me if she ever found out that I had turned him on so much that he had to fuck me until he was completely satisfied Yeah she managed to throw this in my face when she found out jealousy over maternal instinct She s a fucking abusive cunt This was along with all the violent beatings he laid on mom and me not to mention that he kept us indoors and isolated for years aside from the times he was in and out of prison Know how all this came out He knocked me up at the ripe old age of I had to have an abortion He was going to be charged with several things not just for the sexual part but unlawful confinement too Did you know that Mom always treated me like a nuisance even before the pedos telling me that she wished I d never been born screaming Are you fucking retarded if I did something kids normally do such as accidently tipping my juice over at breakfast or took too long doing dishes Enter her violent blowups slaps punches being dragged around by my hair while she screamed visciously Bitch loved to slam her fist between my shoulder blades when I didn t even see it coming I lived in constant fear in childhood I acted out not knowing how to relate to others alienating my peers at school No friends the girl everyone scorned There was no comfort when I was told No one likes you with such vehemence that it still burns in my memory to this day You have no idea how this has isolated me fuck people Not going anywhere near them Isolation is my greatest defence When you have it drilled in your head that you re unwanted it sticks so deeply It burns into the deepest trenches of your being Mom dragged to that fucking tiny hellhole she s from Think that went well You know the one where they re tighter than thieves I was so beaten down and shy of course they took it as me thinking I was better than them I couldn t even look anyone in the eye I was so shy The curled their upper lip when I d pass by I did nothing to deserve this I never hurt any of them I d only wanted to be accepted It didn t help that her next husband tried to convince me I m crazy because I only knew to isolate and couldn t talk to anyone I love my mom no matter what she did and I d call him on his obnoxious behaviour towards her and it made us enemies I hated him deeply as he was a bully and knew she d do anything in her codepent clingy way to keep him He d told me ways of disposing of bodies and not get caught told me he would have killed my mother once if I hadn t walked in the room He d sliced up the mother of his son to the point that he d had served time in a criminal psch ward and arrogantly defended his actions going on about how she deserved it and how much he hated her Whenever he didn t like someone his first comment was that there was something wrong with them in the head Holy fuck pot calling the kettle black or what eh There s can t really be anything truly wrong with me I was just kicked around too much wasn t I Please tell me I m not crazy it s eaten away at me for years I know rationally I m not crazy but this fucking neurotic bullshit eats at me I was truly happy when he died he was evil I d rather have O brien and the other pedophiles than him Fuck everyone thought he was so nice good old uncle rick Piece of motherfucking shit even his corpse is a waste of space Did you know that mom got a lot of money from criminal injuries when you died She was supposed to save it for me but spent it on herself a house and her boyfriends I was lucky to fucking eat or get rags from fucking thrift stores for clothes She still gets cheques each month while your grandkids sit in poverty I took out student loans trying to make something of my self and the debt of it is fucking crushing I nearly finished my degree but trying to make it on my own with the kids too soon after birth nearly killed me Postpartum depression and the stress of it all I ve tried to be strong The kids dad left even before your grandaughter was born I gave birth to her going to university full time and still made the first year winning a scholarship I struggled against depression best I could but I dropped out three times over the years each time summoning stubborn strength to meet the goal of graduating Three strikes I was out No more access to means to finish No jobs to cover tuition loans wiped their hands of me understandably My own stubborn will to try and complete blew up in my face Left with lots of theory and all the pretentious academic terms to describe them but not one practical skill from it all Nonetheless you grandkids You d be so fucking proud of those two hearts of gold and that sparking humour and brains we got from you certainly not her I know you d have spoiled us Mom told us that you really really loved me more than anything you d ever in your life I know that if you were as ga ga over me as you were you d be twice as much over them Nonetheless we struggle I ve been so isolated for most of my life O brien Mom that hellhole she dragged me to settling for the prick of a biological father and more isolation trying to raise the babies in a two bedroom apartment for years not a soul to turn to Not a way to reach out as the isloation eroded any sort of chance to build the means to reach out connect and bond with anyone We re stuck in poverty there s no fucking jobs in this fucking dead end town and even if there were I freeze paralyzed when I try to interact They won I get it I m stupid I m crazy and I m unwelcome I am not allowed to be life if for other people From what Mom tells me you would have have stood before stampedes to protect me I was the apple of your eye you loved me because I was the only thing you ever loved or were loved by Fuck all this shit is just the tip of the iceberg I spoke to your little sister without telling her my intentions and she d be happy to take the kids in case anything happened to me They re better off without me I m so fucking stressed out and scared all the time snarling and isolating from them and everyone else in the world They d be better off with her They re the only things I love in this world but I m no good for them Daddy please I m so fucking scared I m so fucking shoved away I tried I really truly did I ve tried to get education and make things better I ve tried to be the best person I can but nothing helps Please take me back to you Just hold me in your arms make it all go away I ve given it my best shot but over three decades of this shit truly has me worn down I can t go on like this I need to be back in your arms where we loved each other and we were home At the time I could afford it I had a gravestone made for you as I d spent years looking for your grave and no one told me that you were so uncared for that no one had bothered Your own father my mother Both had the means to do so but hey it was all about them you know I just had your name tattoed on me to honour you proudly carrying you with me forever so you know that yes someone loved you sincerely I can t do this anymore however I ve struggled and tried to do my best I just want to be back with you No one wants me here I m not allowed to live and shouldn t be I m not welcome I m unwanted got it Loud and clear PLEASE Just take me back home to you Daddy I ve

It s All My Fault No it isn t Yes it is I m in a strange emotional state right now I don t know how I should be starting my story I don t know what I m supposed to say But I ll try to make it as clear as possible My house has never been one to display much affection Thats not to say we don t love each other or someone is overtly abusive but emotions are not shown very often do I care too much or maybe I don t care at all and I m faking it As a result communication is a major issue and it strains relationships often Another thing to note is that my brother and I are first generation here parents were refugees from Viet Nam My father never graduated high school He began working early and came over to the states as a group sponsored by a church All his life he has done manual labor of some sort and currently works as a mechanic at a self owned although beginning to fail mechanic shop Despite all this he will never ever pass by an opportunity to help someone whether it is through money work or otherwise In my eyes he is practically a saint despite some minor flaws gambling which he has fixed and a little bit of drinking This is because no matter what he will help and expect nothin in return He sees everyone as being equal and will do anyone a favor with a smile on his face even though it may end up costing him Throughout my childhood he was and still is working six days a week from AM to PM at the shop and sometimes even as late as PM He works all day and he works hard even though the business is meager he still does all he can to contribute whatever he can towards our home Because he worked so much I could never see him often and as a child I always saw him as a kind of distant figure that deserved all my respect but I never quite knew why Of course now that I have grown older I fully understand how much he has sacrificed throughout the years in order to give my brother and I what we wanted and what we needed growing up I love him more than words can explain for it and my absolute biggest regret is not spending more time with him and being closer Don t get me wrong he s still healthy and alive but I just wish I could get closer to him but I dont know how At all And it kills me My mother was one of the boat people that fled Viet Nam leaving her parents when she was only At only a week out to sea however her boat was caught up by a Chinese Hong Kong patrol boat and all the members on board were sent to a detention camp in Hong Kong Thankfully because this was towards t he end of the conflict they were able to negotiate her and the others release and passage to America due to political asylum or something I can t recall When she arrived living with her aunt uncle who were already here at the time her first order of business was to get a job and finish high school After that she perservered and went on despite having limited English skills to graduating both college and pharmacy school to become a pharmacist Again my mom is the type of person to go out of her way to help people even if it costs her as evident to the tens of thousands of dollars we constnatly wire back to Viet Nam to aid relatives However she has a quick temper And I mean quick On one hand I guess you could say I m closer to my mom than my dad since she had more education so I could talk with her with more advanced topics and for some reason I could just chat with her better in general but on the other I just felt that there was always a kind of barrier between us as if I had some understood yet unspoken relationship with my dad that I just didn t have with my mom I know this is getting long and I doubt anyone will read it thoroughly I just want to note that at this point I have mostly calmed down and my thoughts are getting more lucid However I feel like writing this is something that I truly need to write to let it out Furthermore the nature of my issue is something that has and probably will recur constantly so while I am in control of my thoughts I figure pre is better than post As you can see from my descriptions I hold both of my parents in very high regards to the point where when I was younger and to a certain extent even now I could see them do no wrong Growing up everything I did I did it to make them happy to please them to constnatly seek their approval And even now I see nothing wrong with that especially when I consider that everything I have now is because they gave up on their dreams or sacrificed their goals in order to provide And I am truly eternally grateful I feel like it is a debt that can only be repaid by living my life through and raising my own children providing them with the same albeit unspoken love and care that my parents have shown me I have learned so much as a person from each of them the foremost being the importance of family and love from my father and the necessity of knowledge determination and respect from my mother Again I cannot fully encompass the gratitude I have towards them and the debt that can never be repaid However this is where the problem begins Even at a young age if my parents ever fought each other or got mad at me or my brother regardless of fault I would blame myself I would not tell them I blamed myself but in my heart I felt that whatever unhappiness that was visited upon them was my fault And thus I always strove to do as they told and avoid upsetting them This worked fine until I d say starting about or years ago when family issues began cropping up As I mentioned earlier my mom was quick to anger and had very low tolerance for mistakes or disrespect My dad is very quiet and softspoken and often will take t he blame in order to diffuse any situation For that respect him immensely Seriously His ability to maintain composure was astounding When my brother began to reach that age where everything and everyone is out to get you a lot of fights broke out in the family because my brother thought my mother was too overbearing and my mother disliked how disrespectful and americanized my brother was becoming Needless to say fights often ended in tears while my father was trying his hardest to calm everyone down and I sat isolated trying to maintain composure but of course blaming myself and trying to find a way to keep the family together As I said earlier from my dad I developed a kind of do everything I can mentality towards my family I refused to become a broken statistic The fights grew in number and volume my brother became more rebellious my father began getting tired etc etc Fast forward to the present I know this is getting long and to be honest everytime I write something I realize I have more to write but keep in mind this is nearly two decades of bottled up emotions that no one has heard

I don t know how to carry on right nowIm living in the UK A small background of my health conditions just to give some context bipolar disorder type severe anxiety obsessive compulsive disorder which I ll explain a little emotionally unstable personality disorder hyper mobility syndrome ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder My diagnoses mean that I really don t and cannot function normally I did for so long forcing everything into a bulging box taping it shut and hiding it under the bed Then I got made redundant from a job that I enjoyed and was good at Very good at It was a call centre admittedly but I really enjoyed it I made some brilliant friends including someone that ended up being my best man and I really do consider him a very good friend Through him I have met other friends plus someone who understands the shit that I am going through I ended up having to take a job that sucked A lot It was the beginning of the opening of that box It was slowly being pulled out from under the bed I was treated like shit I had no sick pay so when I needed the time off when I was having a bad MH day I was financially fucked I was working full time looking after my wife and we struggled a lot Not as bad as some but my god it was hard The job was complicated and my MH which we later worked out was my ADHD just compounded matters greatly I ended up getting another job HUZZAH It was in insurance which is something that I had done at my old job Private office Nice little family run business Annnnnnnnnnnd that s where we hit the snag I wasn t very good I wasn t expecting myself to hit the floor running but I hit the floor Hard I wasn t worried though I thought that I would be at least given training Which I really wasn t In anyway But I soldiered on for four days getting up a lot earlier than I normally would have mental health be damned The pay was so much better no shift work and I could get a bus all the way home meaning that no busy town no social interactions just iPod and a quiet journey home Then four days in the recruitment agency that contacted me initially called I was on the bus leaving town as I had to collect a parcel from one of those amazon thingies as I live in a flat and my wife s mobility isn t great and this was a iPhone so I wanted a secure place for it to go I updated my facebook status New job new me new beginnings Let s do this and let s get life back to what it should be feeling positive I got on the bus and my phone rang It was the recruiter and they had some concerns about my working there The owner wasn t happy that I was asking questions and that I wasn t as good as they expected Don t bother going back My heart stopped and I just didn t know what to do I started to cry but realised as a grown man I had to hold it together on the bus I started to catastrophise terrified I was going to lose my house my bills weren t going to get paid etc etc Then there was my wife What was I supposed to do I got home and tried to be pragmatic I applied for disability I couldn t cope with the prospect of looking for a job in anyway as I knew the box had been ripped open and all manners of hell had been unleashed Pandora had walked off with the proverbial butterfly that signified hope She had walked off crushing it in her palm Disability came through and I was ok for a little bit I ended up in hospital after an attempt but I was getting better day by day I applied for college am doing ok ish on my course I subsequently got diagnosed with ADHD and HMS shortly after and I am struggling but I am finding that some days I am falling under the water and cannot cope I am inflicting a lot of this on my wife being verbally abusive and quite frankly a total c nt I have been physically abusive to her in the past which I am in NO WAY proud of If I had my way before I would not be posting this and someone would have been scraping my remains off the ground floor of a story drop This brings us to now sorry if it seems a little patchy I just wanted to give a little context My OCD is at the point where I cannot stand waking up I struggle with even little things not working just the slightest imperfection in something and it must be rectified there and then It also has left me having to constantly check that I have everything Many times It leads to me being late for things and panicking like a bitch when I cannot find something My memory tends to feed the compulsions I skin pick I cut at spots scars anything that I deem unnecessary This was made very apparent to the disability assessor when I tried to explain things and just couldn t I was left in such a state after that assessment meeting I am so grateful for the person I saw for being so caring and understanding I have found that very little keeps me going at the moment I am trying so hard but cannot cope My HMS leads me to sometimes needing a walking stick It s embarrassing I want to end everything and just make this constant sensation of failure and hell end I have a wife I have an aunt with two little boys that think the world of me I have two best friends again with little ones that do the same I cannot forgive myself for thinking like this But equally I cannot cope with the way my brain is working I don t know what the future will hold I don t know what to do beyond hiding in my room with my laptop and my iPod trying to simulatenously distract myself from myself and hide myself from everything else Thanks for reading if you got this far just writing this down has helped me a teeny tiny bit,"Mental Distress,

I decided to fight last night and I am currently terrified it wont lastI posted my really long google doc explain my whole situation here and on r depression yesterday and some of the responses I received resonated with me I finally sent the document to my gaming clan who hold me in high regard after minutes of physical agony trying to press enter About minutes later it felt amazing like the wound healing after the bandage was ripped off I didn t know what was healing but it was and any healing is good As I ve been saying a thousand mile journey starts with a single step right But I m currently shaking and my heart is racing because I have a strong feeling I ll lose the willpower to live again My chest hurts just thinking about it and I cant stop thinking about it I played a game and had a little bit of fun last night and I dont want to lose that again I m scared to my core right now,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
I am not sure what I expect out of sharing this Anytime I have reached out in a moment of deep despair to our community through the various subs all the beautiful people rush forward and try to help which I appreciate immensely However even if I am alleviated of the pain of my existential issues the issues themselves remain So I have found myself in a moment with less emotional intensity and may be better equipped to rationally examine this I have been VERY careful not to discuss this with most people because I fear disrupting their foundation upon which all the good things rest ideals dreams goals etc If I am to progress past this low point in my life I absolutely need to approach the issue from all angles here I am not great with structuring these things sometimes so please forgive me Of all the lingering elements from my past that still bother me the foremost amongst these is my endless source of self loathing and my issues being invested in this world in this life While discovering I was trans finally gave me what I needed for decades the knowledge of what I am everyone is aware that it can get worse before it gets better I rode most of these waves rather well I believe considering all that has to be unpacked disposed off and the healing that must occur But I think these two things I mentioned keep coming back to bother me How can I stop hating myself if I even should I have felt this and fed this since middle school about twenty years ago While life has occasionally distracted me from this omnipresent fact this is part of the poison that seeps into the well I have tried creating positive feedback loops with proper self talk and productivity revising my mental narrative and outright ignoring those thoughts and feelings and focusing elsewhere I have seen therapists and I am familiar with their tools But this is DEEP and implacable Next as with many of us on this path I managed to survive by escaping this world For me that meant graphic novels standard novels gaming and eventually substances Some people think I am strong but I only managed to endure by being mindful of putting one foot in front of the other while dreaming of other worlds of another life Now even when I try I struggle to engage with this life And by that I mean to really feel invested to DESIRE to work on something and improve something to have the hope of any success I have always felt like I have been a person that just was not there Warning for others that are older harsh thoughts for my age ahead All of this is exacerbated by getting older Its a feeling like waking up from a coma in a house that is literally falling apart around me Having to struggle to get my life on track fighting with the momentum it has taken on and maintaining without any hope of actually improving really my body and appearance is just devastating I was better of not caring at all Who is out there for me What is there at all at this point Acceptance Surrender Just making it through and surviving Those sound like compensation prizes like an achievement worth little to no value I have focused on goals ran upon the hedonic treadmill and behind every thought is why My moment basking in the warmth of my trans epiphany has faded and I am left with the harsh reality of picking up whatever pieces I can find and seeing their value And for me I see none I am weak I am afraid and I am a burden to my family and friends I have broken hearts when I was lost and made so many mistakes I just want rest please I just want to not be me anymore I do not think kind sentiments will do much anymore Thank you for reading Lilith,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Feeling alone and unwantedToday makes the year anniversary of me M moving miles away from my home to go to my dream college I moved south because of what my brothers told me move away from home push yourself outside of your comfort zone and you will be amazing with how much you grow Well the only thing that grew on my was a feeling of worthlessness and insecurity All I see around me are kids my age that are so much more mature or interesting or attractive than me How do they already have so much more figured out So much as talking to someone in the hall fills me with dread Each semester starts the same I m so excited to meet new people to finally get rid of being alone except I can t leave my bed I m so overcome with the fear of humiliating myself Since coming to college I ve met people who eventually ghost me and end up just adding to the long list of snapchat stories I watch that only make me sink further into my whole I m done here I can t even quit and go home my mother would be so upset She s already managing a divorce and counseling of her own I can t burden her with this If I was to die I don t think anyone would notice,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Nietzsche for the Interested and Depressed Let me begin by dispelling a common misconception Nietzsche is not a nihilist If you associate him with nihilism dear reader it may be easier for you to understand what I am about to say if you pretend that you have never heard the name of Friedrich Nietzsche I find that many individuals come to a point where they stop look around and realize that they are a mouse in a labyrinth hunting for cheese however not only do they seem to be losing the game but they don t quite see the point of even playing They find that everything around them is an false image So much phoniness surrounds them with no escape Then they look at themselves and find that they have nothing to live for Congratulations friend if this is you you have stumbled upon the dark truth of man You have made it half the way the way there but I feel you have one more conclusion to draw that will return purpose to your life Beginning with the arguments of Plato Socrates and other Greek philosophers the original purpose of man was to follow a telos a goal to seek the purest form of the self For these thinkers there was a pure form of justice of triangles of logic and of man that were concealed by images projected by the objects themselves and by culture and only through argumentation can one find these Forms in a sort of team effort This sort of thinking provides at the very least a basis for morals and is the foundation for the character we try to instill in children Remember even before you started school how your mothers tried to teach you to be honest and kind as though they were inherent characteristics of man Eventually people began to question the existence of these Forms such as Immanuel Kant Friedrich Nietzsche Joseph Conrad among others Each of them provided their alternatives to these forms Likewise you seeker of truth have found that the forms in and of themselves are lies and it is here you Nietzsche Conrad Holden Caufield and Hamlet have found common ground however it is time to move back from the abyss and find a role and participate in the grand play of this world Nietzsche provides a solution for this issue Beginning with the given that ALL morality is a fiction a construct of society rather than attempting to distinguish truth from fiction the distinction must be made between fiction and better fiction Fictions range from an appreciation of Mozart and the Golden Rule to playing hockey or going to the club But with no grounding for even this quest for fictions it begs the question Why bother with these fictions The answer is That is life A life consists of a collection of actions of doing of being of finding whatever interests you KNOWING THAT IT IS NOT TRUE Football for example consists men running about attempting to move a pigskin and tackling each other but millions of people have adopted this fiction and made the rules a part of their lives Conrad expresses the pursuit of better fictions as turning to work Work is any activity that produces a better understanding of the self and that provides joy While science has discovered that we are a bunch of atoms you can do nothing with that information Unless of course you are a biochemist I haven t expressed all that I would have liked due to homework that I ve been putting off please comment with questions comments hate love criticism and I will try to answer accordingly TL DR You may have realized that the truth is we are a bunch of atoms however the point of life is not necessarily to find truth but to find more ways to enjoy life and provide substance for it Look at Maximus Pryme comment for a more focused analysis of Nietzsche than my rambling essay,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

I feel helpless watching myself destroy my futureHi SW I m a student at university I should be happy with where I am and the subject I m studying but I m not I ve been having problems with education and my social life as far as I can remember It is only now that these problems have intensified to the extent where my life has become a disorganized mess I have been to several councilors in high school to help keep myself up to date with homework and coursework Since I ve started university I have fallen behind on my work and social life My dorm room was covered with post it notes and reminders on my walls I was forgetting to complete and hand in coursework I ve been receiving letters from my tutors who are concerned about my progress At the end of last term it was too much and I had a breakdown I went to see my doctor about the problems i ve been having he was not much help so he is referring me to a psychiatrist I m now on a six month waiting list I have not discussed any of my problems with my parents as I m afraid of disappointing them They will be furious at me for destroying an opportunity to a good career and life I feel like this is beyond my control now I ve wasted a lot on my cost of living and tuition fees I lost a lot of friends I have made by being selfish and neglecting them I feel the only way forward is to end my own life By the time I get to see a psychiatrist it will be too late and even if i do get help sooner I doubt it will change much about myself This is my third time re writing this so i hope I got my message across clearly I m sorry for not being more specific about everything If I try explain things I start rambling and don t get a point across Thank you for taking the time to read this,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Not sure what to doI moved states to live with my mom and step dad to try and finish college When I moved in they told me to just focus on school and if it didn t work out they would pay for trade school After my first semester they started talking about me getting a loan for community college I lost a lot of motivation and when I talked to them about a trade the first thing out of my step dad mouth was who s gonna pay for it I have been trying for a few years now and everytime i start school i have to stop normally for financial reasons This whole time though they have helped my step sister threw school She graduates next month with her master s But community college cost to much for me to keep going I dont even want to anymore now I stopped going to class over a month ago and finals will be soon I just feel defeated I am with not even an AA I feel so betrayed and life still hasn t gotten better Just more disappointment and set backs If this is all life is for me I think if I make it to without being able to make it on my own that I will just end it,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
i dont feel like i am boyfriend material lets just open with the cliche as the title says i dont feel like boyfriend material And i think this because I just got out of my first relation and i am back to having to no friends again And during that relationship i had some trouble talking about some small problems we had Also i think i am very clingy because i didnt like her going around with other boys but since i am a very quiet person i didnt say anything about it Also i think that when i reach the age to have sex i dont think i can do like dirty talk and stuff Maybe this is just something that has been fed to by porn but i dont know since i am only Also im a huge doubter and over thinker Because every time my girlfriend acted off my mind would start racing and shit Also dont think i can prioritize a girlfriend above my usual activities like gaming consuming content on youtube and school Also i am sure that i am not attractive yeah you can say but you had a girlfriend but i have to things against that Around a year ago we went on a school trip and on the way back some guys were asking some hot girl who she would date And then they said my name And she just like yelled ewwwww The friends of my ex were ask her all the time how she could like me amp x B i will probably add some things later because i really need to some school work now,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

My StoryI ve been heavily addicted to drugs marijuana opiates benzos for the past decade I quit opiates a year ago and am current days sober from weed I m prescribed klonopin because I do suffer from GAD but I do abuse them As a child I was emotionally abused by both my parents My dad can only understand money and sports I didn t like sports nor was I very good at them but he made me play them all not exaggerating which created a cycle of disappointment humiliation and emasculation My mother has some undiagnosed personality disorder She spent most of my childhood either crying having imaginary fights with me when I d be in an entirely different part of the house and making me take her medication because she said I was the reason she was so sad I got into a good college in and then the financial crash of happened Intellectually unqualified for any field of study with job security I studied English Lit got through college smoking myself into isolation and barely crawling out with zero distinction or careee goals Upon graduating I moved back home My dad always one to shove square pegs into round holes said I had to work for him and got me a job selling insurance in my hometown while everyone I knew fro college moved to Brooklyn or Los Angeles to intern at some prestige bullshit or stay in the womb of academia and get masters or their ph d It was during this time that my mom decided to become an alcoholic This was enough and so I just moved about hours away from my family to temporarily live with my sister who git me a job but who s understandably put some limits on the time I can live with her I m consumed with anger regret and isolation Quitting pot means I m fighting a long lonely mindfuck battle that absolutely nobody gives a fuck about I ve wasted every opportunity I ve had and spend my time reading classic literature playing chess or watching TV in other words still avoiding figuring out how to make something of my life I was raised Catholic left the church but still remain sympathetic to the concept of Agape I don t know if many of you read but I cried for hours over Joyce s Ulysses which despite its many difficulties is simply about thus Love for others despite all of life s injustices Well even with all that I am consumed by loathing both for myself and for what s going on in my country right now guess which country I feel completely useless and want to leave Even the genius of a book like Joyce s Ulysses can t persuade me to stick around My mother has begun sending me drunk texts filled with misspelt apologies but I ve finally blocked them My dad and I have an OK relationship but it s still one defined by tragic misunderstanding and with years of recovery from drug abuse ahead of me it just seems like too much I don t foresee marriage I don t foresee career fulfillment Well that s my story I don t want to pay for a therapist so I needed to scream into a void somewhere If you ve read this far thank you,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

The loneliness during lockdown has now really gotten to me Ever since the lockdown I ve been gradually getting more and more detached from reality all the games I play have now become boring and having no contact with my friends really doesn t help As of writing my sleep schedule has started to make me wake up at night and sleep through the entire day I always drift off at around AM and then wake up at PM at the earliest and latest As a result my routine I m trying to get to is ripped apart because of it I ve been administered around two sleeping pills every night multiple times but my body quickly adapts to it and puts up a tolerance to the sleeping pills after one or two nights when given a dosage and one of my siblings are convinced I m suffering from Insomnia I m convinced it s getting worse by each passing night I can barely be bothered to get myself up from bed now due to lack of motivation I m not good with arts writing or music anymore and the games I once enjoyed playing I ve now grown more distant with each passing day losing more motivation by each one I have a feeling that I might lose so much motivation that one day when I go to sleep and wake up I ll just go back to sleep again And then the cycle will repeat itself School is not helping either I can t cope with the online work given especially since I only have one computer that is not used for playing games As a result I ve given that up too I just can t cope with this lockdown any longer and that s coming from a borderline introvert TL DR Lockdown sucks signed by an introvert,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

I was an anti masker and now have Covid If you want to see the rainbow you have to put up with the rain Wearing a mask and social distancing is a small price to pay for things to go back to normal Until a couple of weeks ago I was an anti masker I live in Florida and work in a restaurant and it was only until masks became mandatory in my restaurant after months of not wearing one that I came around and understood the importance of wearing a mask My excuses were that it is hot I am constantly running around and wearing a mask I thought would slow me down and make me uncomfortable The funny thing is I d never actually worn a mask before so I had no real knowledge of what wearing it would feel like Let me tell you all ITS NOT THAT BAD Sure you might get a LITTLE warmer than you would if you weren t wearing it but that is a reasonable price to pay for preserving the safety and lives of others I have taken a complete on this issue and feel guilty for my stance before Let me be clear A mask does not make you immune to coronavirus I work in an overcrowded restaurant and even after wearing a mask every second at work i still tested positive for coronavirus a few days ago Social interaction is the worst possible thing we could be doing right now and I am quarantined in my house with a lot of things to think about How my comfort used to overrule others safety How I used to hate people pushing for masks how annoying it was and now how important it is If anyone reading this would just take a minute to examine what makes their life more important than anyone else s I think we would have a lot more lives saved A mask doesn t make you immune but it does help And refusing to wear one going out partying and not social distancing is a selfish and deadly exercise to partake in I wish you all well and urge you to please wear masks as often as you can and only go outside for things that are truly necessary The lives and wellbeing of those around you and yourself are more important than your body temperature,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

At what point is it better to die than to live this way I ve been struggling with this condition for months now with no sign of recovery of my waking life my mind is blank completely devoid of mental activity It is a constant struggle of mine to maintain any form of awareness Additionally my short term and long term memory function at nearly amnesiac levels and my ability to focus and simply put think are at an atrociously low level My brain has a complete absence of mental activity This subjective experience is hard for me to quantify or explain but almost all the time my mind is completely blank like a zombie In a sense I m mentally catatonic like someone gave a computer the wattage of a light bulb just enough energy to give the appearance of awareness Every moment I m awake is a struggle to maintain some form of consciousness When not stimulated by loud music video games or the constant novelty of the Internet I zone out My mind is completely empty there is no thought whatsoever This brings me to my memory issues both short and long term trying to remember what I did as recently as yesterday requires a huge amount of effort Sometimes I ll be able to remember scattered details about the day before like where I had lunch but memories are scattered and non linear Trying to remember something that happened a day ago a week ago or a year ago feels the same There is just no clarity of memory I feel perpetually spaced out my mind feels foggy as though I m in a dream or under the influence of some substance I feel awake yet not awake sleepy although im physically fully awake I have trouble with social interaction because I just don t know what to say most of the time Frequently i have to stop and think of a decent response just to look normal because otherwise there d be nothing I have to say The times I do have something to speak up on I often stutter because I have trouble finding the right words to use or put them together in a sentence There are times where I ll just mentally blank out mid utterance and have not a clue what I wanted to say next I feel like I m just existing in this one moment with no past no connection to the present and no future I d rather die than live the rest of my life as this empty shell of a person,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping",Medium
Inevitable I feel like I m ready to take on a proper job and try to do good but my only motivation is to secure the ability to acquire an exit bag without prompting suspicion It s very hard to be subtle about acquiring a fucking tank of helium I do feel okay right now but I forever consider it an inevitability I can t stop drinking or altering myself it s the only thing that makes me feel okay but I feel at near I ve lost all means of opportunity the way my teeth look due to a lack of care etc I m trying to improve now finally but it s too late I can t stand being photographed or being filmed What good is that for an entertainer My caseworker and the mental health team at the drug alcohol clinic I ve been visiting are trying their best but I m ready to dash them away and sink again I just don t know I haven t hit bottom yet I shudder to think what it will be I m not ready to stop It s the only thing that makes me feel like a million dollars I think most likely that I ll end up climbing a mountain and jumping off But who knows what the future holds I don t foresee much but hypothetical attempts Cutting has proved too difficult I need something assured Hopefully I can prove myself wrong Be well please,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Failed university thinking of throwing in the towel on life altogetherI ve been pursuing a bachelor s degree for four years now and I just found out I failed classes this semester which means my financial aid will be terminated Without it I can t afford tuition I have no idea how I m going to break this to my parents This was not suppose to happen I was suppose to graduate this spring and find a decent job with a decent wage that would motivate me to pursue professional help to confront my avoidant personality disorder and possibly move out of my parents home I was so so close sigh University was really the only thing I had going for me it was the only redeeming aspect of my life I have no friends no significant other most people would probably consider my lifestyle boring I read books browse the internet workout attend university while making sure to always keep to myself i m basically a hermit I would only venture out of my house to attend classes or the gym I guess the thing that bothers me the most aside from fucking up my future is that I know why I failed it s a mixture of a lot of things really I was studying a major a didn t care for that had lousy job prospects worse part is I chose it I chose it because it required very little math my brain doesn t work well with numbers so my choices were very limited to begin with Some of my peers dropped out after the first year but I kept going passing by doing the absolute bare minimum C s get degrees right I continued despite feeling deeply dissatisfied because my whole life I was conditioned to go to college and obtain a higher education there s a stigma attached to those people who take alternative avenues I m already judged enough by the abnormal life I lead really didn t need to add another thing to the mix Do any of you guys have any advice I have no idea where to go from here Once the anger wears off my parents are probably going to demand I get a job and contribute with expenses which is totally understandable If I was a healthy functional adult I would comply without hesitation but I can t even imagine myself going through the whole interview process much less sustaining a job All I know is how to be a student I suppose not even that I m filled with absolute apprehension when I contemplate my future I m soon to be and I have nothing to show for FUCK,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Dark Realizations Planning for the futureFor a long time I have been teetering on the living vs dying debate Obviously I want to live but at some point it stops being worth enduring existing Responsibilities offset this and delay death but when those responsibilities expire I don t see the point of living any longer Yes there are experiences I have yet to have Yes I could have happy days or even contentment but at what cost I don t want to go through life in a medicated stupor in attempt to offset the remnants of an evolutionary advantage I m not interested in self medicating either If I live I want to live in sobriety and awareness I don t see much point in existing unless I m living for the benefit of others Martyrdom seems like a silly reason to go on existing There is always the selfishness argument but at some point there must be a threshold where you ve done enough and clocked in enough time I am definitely not at that point yet but I will be and I know it So when that time comes what reasons do I have to live I can look back on my life and see happiness and regrets I can think about what will become of my survived loved ones and create narratives where they suffer and grieve but that grief won t be about me It will be their own regrets They ll wonder what they could have done differently and what could have pushed me to that point all the while knowing and understanding my struggle They ll regret being self absorbed like we all are and wish they could have done things differently but they can t and neither can I Some may carry it longer than others and I ll do my best to write heartfelt notes of absolution so that they understand that I finally crossed the threshold and that it isn t their fault I ve had practice at that I ve written them on separate occasions but someone s need always overrode my need to die I wish I would have died years ago I m already late I ve already lived too much and too long and brought even more suffering upon myself and those around me Yes there has been happiness I m not denying that but there isn t enough and I have no means to facilitate more happiness in my life I am and have been emotionally destitute for quite some time and I m tired of it The joy I have in my life is illusory and deluded I create narratives where things are different I immerse myself in these narratives to convince myself that I am needed and that the world is better off with me here It isn t So what do I do How do I stop this I am not in any imminent danger but I have a strong sense that it will happen I don t have any dreams left and I want nothing from the future I am not looking forward to anything and every activity of my life is simply passing time until the inevitable end I do not dread this end but I feel the need to test this accepted reality against the harshest of critics Thanks for reading,"Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Another depressed guyHello hi I feel like shit and I ve decided to share my story At first I need to say I don t wanna give too much personal info in case someone I know came across this I m in my early s I ve been sort of a recluse for most of my life clumsy bullied at school etc Most of my childhood and teens passed by as I was playing video games or killing time in some other way A couple of years ago I decided to change it and live a normal life which ended up in a failure Not so long ago I discovered that there are several things wrong with my body After an extensive google research I ve found out that I have numerous birth defects usually associated with some syndrome that s not the case Most of them aren t really serious if you saw me on a street you probably wouldn t notice anything However one of them hampers my ability to practice sports what may explain my clumsiness and the other one my sexual life that is if there was one Also one of them seems very rare since I couldn t find anything like that on the internets And the whole combo is just mind blowing for me I ve sought medical help but it seems the only thing that could help explain my issue would be some form of extensive genetic testing I know that there are people with full blown syndromes who have it worse than me but still it feels bad and strange And as a consequence I feel very odd it s difficult to explain as if I wasn t really a human And no I m no hypochondriac Apart from my physique I m pretty detached from people on the social plane I must admit I m quite bright and sensitive artsy and find no interest in popular culture I can think of one person I feel comfortable talking with but she doesn t seem to give much shit about me I expect too much I don t want to die but life is just a burden for me I can t recall a moment when I was happy If there isn t any sort of compulsion to do something I could lie in bed the whole day long The only thing that keeps me alive is probably music I m a bit into literature but the stories are about normal healthy people or with some well described diseases however strange may it sound and I can t identify with that Also I m an atheist but even if it turned out god exists I would consider him an asshole for making his children s lives so shitty Also I get restless easily and can t really relax something is always bothering me I m seeing a psychologist who seems to know his job and I have past experience with mental care people but it doesn t seem to fix my life and the world as a whole I would like to say that I feel better after spitting it out unfortunately I don t Anyways it s nice if you didnt tl dr this,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Breathing is painful for me Every breath hurts chronic pain makes it hard to keep goingI meant that it literally hurts for me to breathe not that it hurts to exist In I had a turbinate reduction Turbinates are bony structures in the nose that warm and humidify the air you breathe Because the procedure was botched my turbinates no longer do their job The air I breathe is cold and harsh I get constant headaches my throat is always dry because the air I breathe is dry and my nose is too open so the air pounds the back of my throat when I inhale As a result I have trouble sleeping hence why I am posting this at almost AM I feel a drowning sensation if I sniff too hard I have moments where my nostrils just burn They call this Empty Nose Syndrome a condition many doctors won t acknowledge They literally think it doesn t exist I exhibit all of the symptoms that come with this disease except for the defining symptom which is feeling like you re suffocating I m thankful I don t feel the worst symptom but also feel like if I did I would have killed myself long ago and maybe that would have been a good thing because it would mean my suffering would not have gone on for years but because I don t feel that symptom I m hesitant to call it that It s easy to tell someone things will get better because a lot of the time they do But sometimes I m not so sure you can tell that to someone suffering from chronic physical pain especially from something which is rare and has no cure My turbinates will never grow back My only hope is that there will be advances in regenerative medicine in my lifetime that are amazing enough to restore missing nasal tissue I don t see that happening especially when the focus is on helping people with much more common conditions I m invisible to the medical community I haven t been happy since my breathing was ruined I hate that breathing hurts because it s literally the one thing people have to do all the time It s hard to focus on things because the pain is so distracting I m going to wrap up my second bachelor s degree a degree in Computer Science in the fall and it kind of sucks knowing it would have been so much easier if breathing just felt normal again Same applies to all the things I like doing I enjoy everything less because I have to breathe while doing it obviously Playing games making music spending time with my loved ones all of it I enjoy life less because of it to the point where I m not sure it s worth living anymore I d go into six figures of medical debt today if I knew I could get my turbinates back I d trade this for cancer in a heartbeat at least you can beat cancer and at least it kills you if you lose the battle instead of making you suffer until you die I d go back in time years if it meant I could change the decision to walk into the operating room I d rather deal with the congestion I used to have any day of the week I hate feeling like a prisoner in my own body and I feel like killing it means I win Not a day goes by that I don t think about killing myself I m certainly not going to do it this week or this month Maybe after I achieve a lot of the things I wanted to achieve because there are still things I want to do before I die But if I am ever in a mall and a mass shooting takes place I promise you that I ll be the first person charging at the shooter Best case scenario I m a hero and saved a ton of people Worst case scenario I m a victim and nobody has to feel guilty for my killing myself That s my rant I m going to try to fall asleep again If anyone took the time to read all of this thank you and you re free to message me or comment,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Feel pretty rubbish about myself rn I m pan ace female in a relationship with a straight ace male and my sister is bi in a relationship with a bi male My sister is very loud and proud about her sexuality and LGBT issues whereas her boyfriend and myself are more closeted Nothing wrong with either of those but sometimes she likes to throw it in your face a bit and constantly talks about how sexy fit attractive girls are in front of her boyfriend which apparently he feels bad about and I m sure if he was talking about dudes she d be upset She claims to understand LGBT and mental health issues with her activism but if you mention a problem she ll often make fun of you make a joke which isn t funny Basically my town have pride flags up at the moment and I was upset because I hadn t seen a pan or ace flag yet I saw a NB flag today possibly questioning if I m NB atm but only a few people know and it made me happy We walked past and I said guess the flag and she was like non binary and I was like yeah all excitedly As a joke I pointed out the rainbow flag and asked her to guess because everyone knows that flag and she said stop trying to pretend like you re gayer than me which really hurt I m not as open about my sexuality and I ve never been with another gender apart from male so it made me really upset We then walked past a pan flag and I freaked I was so happy because I hadn t seen one yet And I was saying how cool it was and she was like I d call myself pan but I can t be arsed Like what Then went to say how she can label herself what she likes Of course she can but it s weird that she d say that as if being pansexual is a bad thing And finally I said now we have to find an asexual flag and she said yeah but remember asexuals don t exist I was like WTF and she said it was a joke Not very funny is it See what I mean about showing how she cares for the community but then makes a remark like that It happens constantly Especially with my mental health triggers Nothing she said today was funny None of it I can t believe she had the audacity to say that and invalidate both me and my boyfriend On mobile so sorry for the format I kinda need cheering up,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Stories of people mistaking me for adults Im quite big even though Im and from behind one could realisticly assume a late s early s man was standing in front of them This turns out to be really confusing for some people My dad and I were at a department store that was specialised for tech stuff and we were looking for a dongle for my macbook The store we were in was quite small and you had to squeeze between people most of the time this was pre corona As my dad and I were looking around I hear someone asking how much a terabyte cost Initially I just assumed a middle age man from his voice was asking an employee even if his question didnt exactly make sense hard disk or ssd presumably so I ignored him The guy repeated his question a few times but again I just assumed he was trying to get an employees attention and ignored him Now I was wearing a fluorescent shirt Mistake The employees also wore flourescent Eventually the guy got frustrated and tapped me on my shoulder How much does a terabyte cost Oh I dont work here I say revealing my baby face The confused look on the guys face was a sight to behold and he apologised for being rude We still laugh at this instance today even though its been a few months Never saw the guy again TLDR someone thought I was a store employee I was not My family were at a school function for my brother and at the end everyone went to dinner together For some context my hypersocial mom is friends with most of the parents and teachers present or should I say all of them The dinner starts it was all you can eat and some of the parents start walking around offering wine to other parents its kind of their thing they drink a lot Of course they arent exactly daft enough to offer alcohol to the students Eventually they come round to our table and someone taps my shoulder quite obviously talking to me would you like some wine I look around and the parent behind me burst out laughing They thought I was my dad in this story i was and roughly the same size as my dad My stature had struck again Maybe if they didnt drink so much they could have seen that I was my dad TLDR semi drunk parent thinks im my dad,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

I dont see things getting much betterClearly if I m posting here im not wanting to die In fact I really wish life could be better for me I just dont believe I will get better My issues come from a lot of trauma and I ve been in therapy for more than years I consistently do things to try to better my life I try to make healthier decisions I try to be a better person and I try to employ the fake it til you make it method of being happy not in a disingenuous way just trying to make good habits I have some good days I have some comfortable and quiet days I do not necessarily have happy days And more so than the former I have a lot of really hard moments and days I m tired of feeling haunted I m tired of the hauntings always coming back and always getting in the way I feel like I m doing everything I can maybe I m not i dont know But at what point is it just the rational decision to accept the reality of circumstance There are plenty of people trapped to cycles of mindsets and behaviors they cannot change or are almost incapable of changing On my best days I do not believe in much besides biology and chance Things have no meaning besides what you give them If I were capable of feeling safe and comfortable then I would be happy finding things that I have meaning in And i try to do this But I can t have the basic foundation of stability On my worst days I am convinced that the world or at least my own world is plagued with pain The one thing I can believe in is pain It is consistent and promised and not fake I cannot believe in anything else as genuinely as I can pain At what point is limiting the amount of pain I continue to endure or encounter the more rational decision rather than being a sitting duck waiting for the next trauma to come Or the next affirmation that I cannot trust myself nor others Or the next proof that there is no good around me I dont want to wait for those things My hauntings convince me those things are coming whether they are or not Which makes those things reality anyways I m tired of the moments where I feel completely despaired and fearful Not even entirely sure what my body and mind are dreading most of the time sometimes my mind just rationalizes that intense fear by creating paranoid thoughts And then I lose my sense of self and reality even more It s awful to have flashbacks and nightmares and then paranoia Its awful to believe everything can and will hurt me I m tired,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping",Medium

Will Pedophilia Happen To Be Normalized In the Future Pedophilia is not something new we all have been sickened or rather even angered by the very existence of it However in the recent past weeks a large number of social media accounts news articles and even memes have been discussing the very topic of the so called MAPS self identified maps aka pedophiles and how they are trying to normalize themselves by trying to get along with LGBtQ communities and even going as far as creating a flag to represent themselves Personally as a person who is extremely critical to topics of pedophilia and rape I was sickened and was worried In a recent talk with one of my friends about these topics we saw how people of LGBTQ communities were oppressed and were often hated and harassed by the general public and how it can still be seen in our older generation such as our grandparents and even our peers often labeling them as unnatural I was told about how just like in the past the people who hated LGBTQ communities are now considered conservative and parochial one day we might be too be seen like this but in this case it would be due to our disagreement with the very presence of pedophiles Countless underaged children are being abused and over sexualize for the sake of entertainment and fame by their parents and guardians and it has provided with a means of media for these pedophiles and you can virtually find child porn in literally any hentai Japanese pornographic art labeled as loli available at one click away Will in the future after common interaction of people about such sensitive topics make them numb and result in pedophilia to become destigmatized and be a thing of the future and we have to stay quiet about it I as a person is genuinely scared and angered with the very possibility and the helplessness I feel Please let me know what you think tl dr Will pedophilia become common and legalized and we will be known as the boomers of the future generations,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

How to masturbate for men You really don t have to masturbate if you don t want to no actual benefits But if you do want to here is how to do it can t believe I m typing this but let s go There are methods for male masturbation there is anal but I have never done it and I am not knowledged in the slightest about it Standing and laying however you can perform the standing technic laying and the laying technic standing it s just refering to how they are most commonly performed First for all find some time to do it I suggest getting about minutes of free time Then find someplace where your semen won t be a problem and isn t shared by anyone else other than someone you are in a relationship with Then get something to clean it A good wipe will do You can then find something to do it to It doesn t have to be porn or lewd doesn t even have to be a picture you can even use your imagination although keep in mind it s easy to get distracted Then do it in hours when you won t fall asleep during the masturbation sadly I am guilty of that one Also do it fully naked You don t want stains on your clothes You can also use a form of lubrication but that is optional unless you are doing anal stimulation Now on how to do the standing method Get in a comfortable position then undress yourself Get a grasp of your penis in your palm and start stroking it As gentle rough or however you feel like Don t worry no harm will be done to your foreskin Just keep going whilst slightly stroking faster and faster until you ejaculate That really is it all Now on how to do the laying method Undress yourself and find a soft object Then just rub your penis or your entire body on that object until you ejaculate Keep in mind that that object WILL get stained no matter how much you try not to stain it That s pretty much it Now if you don t know what ejaculation feels like don t worry you ll know it when it happens If you want to know how sperm is supposed to look like fresh out of the penis break and egg in a bowl and look at the transparent liquid Imagine this but white Now sperm is going to be sticky smells surprisingly like cleaning chemicals and taste like bugger don t ask how I know the last one and don t attempt to taste it And that s it Now go on and masturbate,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium

I m Just So Done and FrustratedI have never been this depressed in my entire life it has never been this bad before and I m so tired of crying every single day and being in an eternal anxiety attack Over months ago I moved back to my home state leaving the city I always dreamed of and loved I didn t think it would be a big deal leaving my job because I ve never had issues finding a job before A little over a month after I moved I got offered a great job with what I thought was a great company and great money Well turns out they had decided to eliminate the position I had originally been offered so that left me with no job Upon further research of the company they are involved in a lot of sketchy things I started looking for other jobs and now it s been months and I am just so done I have never had an issue finding a job before but this time has been awful I ve been to over interviews and none of them have done anywhere except for one that I was offered from the hiring manager that was then denied by the owner of the company because I would have been the only female besides the hiring manager there and he only wants guys working there I am in the process of filing a complaint against them I ve had no money for months because I had let my boyfriend use it all because I didn t think I d be having this much trouble My relationship is deteriorating by the day because now neither one of us have money and he blames me for every thing because I ran out of money I ve gone to staffing agencies which have all been sketchy and advertise jobs they don t even have who have nothing I ve been to counselors who have told me to take things off my resume my master s degrees and a lot of my previous employment because it shows all my experience and places aren t going to want to pay what I ve previously been paid Nothing has worked I went from an average of an hour to lowering myself to then then which I haven t made since I was and realizing I m going to be working or jobs just to get us an apartment and yet I still can t get a job There is no money At all I don t even have gas to go see him My friends some of who I ve been staying with are all so done with me begging for money all the time I seriously just don t know what to do anymore I ve never been in this position before and I ve lost every thing and nothing is getting better I just don t want to live anymore,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Day of spending one hour a night trying to convince myself to kill myselfNot going well as I m still here obviously It s a lot harder to hold a gun to your head for an extended period of time then I thought So now what I do is pull up a chair in front of a mirror and sit there holding the gun I normally start off just talking into the mirror about all of the reasons that I am a complete piece of shit and deserve to die It was starting to feel a little bit practiced so I ve really been trying to go through and explain to myself why I am such a failure and a fuckup I usually move on to all of my failed attempts of bettering myself past and present and why I will never succeed at getting better It s difficult but I think over time I will wear myself down If I have time left over I will hold the gun to my head or just visualize shooting myself In a fucked up way I feel the best when I am putting myself down during these sessions It feels good to tell myself that I m a piece of shit and that I deserve to die,Positive Coping,Low
it s rude to have guests over if you re deadmy brain keeps yelling at me that i could just take my entire bottle of zoloft right now if i really wanted to and i could die and it d all be easier i got diagnosed with bpd earlier this week but i has to be wrong because no one has said anything for the over years i ve been in therapy i m a bad person i already know that and i m not crazy i saw this video of a woman who talked about gt writing letters to people in her own blood lt and like i m crazy i guess but not that crazy i m just thinking about dying and i realize no one would miss me and the people who say they would are probably just lying to me because everyone leaves and why would anyone anywhere ever try to help me or actually care it s just fucking ridiculous imagining that anything good will happen when it never will the only thing keeping me from doing it is that i have a guy coming over to build my pc with me later and i think it d be kinda rude to invite someone over and then when they show up you re dead i mean that s giving them an experience they weren t asking for and would probably fuck them up for life amp x B if anything this is all just a stupid feeling that s gonna pass later and by the time he leaves i ll be fine and i don t wanna come off like an attention whore like i m sure everyone thinks i am but i know no one is gonna respond to this it s just easy to yell into the void i guess,"Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

I need to get this out of my chest Well hello I don t even know how to start this post but I will try I have been lurking this sub for some months now it has helped me a lot to forget about my situation but I can t keep running from this and I really don t have anyone to talk about this so I m going to try and vent a little in here and maybe it ll manage to be therapeutic Everything started a few years ago and I don t want to bore you with all the details about my life those are more suited for a psychologist but the gist of it is that I have always been hated all my friends tend to treat me like trash and even some teachers and family members did this so I started to become a cynic while I got left out and started to live life in solitude All of this didn t really bother me it was so typical that I just started to normalize it until eventually I became very depressed Alone and with no one to trust everything started to fall down on me my life broke apart and I desperately tried to cling to something to keep finding meaning a reason to live the sad thing is that all of that wasn t the tip of the iceberg I just kept holding on trying to be strong only to be met by weakness It started to get worse as I entered High school everyone found groups meaning something while I got left out once again Eventually I managed to find some friends that still treated me horrible they hit me and verbally abuse me I kind of drifted apart from them as the year started but the pandemic happened I went inside my house I stopped seeing people they stopped talking to me on a regular basis and I just got left alone once again At first it wasn t hard but life kept on going strong with me time and time again it kept dealing low blows the months kept advancing and I just felt like I was stuck in a blurry mist where everything just sucked We fast forward a bit probably around months or so where I started to show symptoms of a disease called APL I don t want to enter to much detail but basically I get micro infarcts in my brain and it s practically a miracle that I haven t lost my speech ability or my walking ability It s just random anything could happen ranging from hallucinations to turning into a vegetable And well I got diagnosed weeks ago my life style had to change and I lost the few things that helped me hold on to life those little hobbies that helped me escape for a few moments from reality they are just gone now and I don t have a clear picture any longer of how to keep going The weird thing is that I m not scared probably the only thing preventing me from ending it all is my stubbornness to admit defeat against a life that put plenty of cards against me So that s why I m writing this essay here today I just felt like no one could help me anymore so I m relying in complete strangers to help me grasp my new reality and well yeah keep on going Maybe this isn t the right community to write this but I just hope that I can find some way to find meaning to life And well if you managed to get here and didn t get bored with my life I thank you for reading me I know it doesn t mean much coming from a complete stranger but I can t offer anything else so sorry so yeah this is the post I hope I can some day find something but until then I guess I m going to just say goodbye and thank you Thanks for coming to my ted talk,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Tonight for the first time ever I m genuinely wondering if I want to keep goingI m I ve always been a pretty big time loner and since my middle school years have been very prone to bits of depression and despondence But tonight is the first time I ve ever genuinely wondered whether or not I wanted to keep going I ve been trying to sleep for three hours but there s just no way The thoughts are too strong I look at my own life I have a college degree that I can t use in a field I don t enjoy I m stuck bagging groceries and don t actually aspire to do anything more I have no one I d consider a friend My relationship with my family grows more and more distant as I begin to hate myself and withdraw myself more and more I don t see anything to look forward to I look at the world around me What a complete and total fucking mess Pandemic panic climate crises ever worsening political polarization rise in totalitarianism and Draconian policy worldwide I just don t see a single god damn thing to look forward to More and more I ve been projecting my self hatred onto others I view them as being like me Lowlife failures whose lives aren t worth anything I m not deserving of love assistance attention affection or acknowledgement and therefore neither are they And I hate myself a lot Hating everyone else that much is exhausting I could talk to a professional but that s a tough one for me When I was I was struggling in class because I hated myself back then to and wasn t trying so my mom dragged me to a psychiatrist On the spot he diagnosed me with ADD and gave me an Adderall prescription The third time I took it I was rushed to the hospital with a seizure that was caused by the medication This psych s solution was to see if my doctor could prescribe me a downer to go with the Adderall so that didn t happen again So since then my trust in the entire healthcare profession is utterly non existent I actively believe they try to harm their patients for profit Opening up to a therapist won t be easy or productive I don t think I d view it as walking into a room with a live grizzly bear I m just waiting for the harm to come my way So I hate myself a lot don t feel like there s anything going on in the future that s worth looking forward to and I feel just utterly broken I desperately need a break from social media that includes Reddit but unfortunately I hate myself too much to do what s right for me I m not sure I deserve help or that a person like me is worth talking down Maybe this ll pass Who knows But I ve never felt this before I should be in the prime of my life in my mid s But instead all I can bring myself to do is sit in my room alone on my laptop That s it That s what I aspire to I hate myself so much,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

The time I almost got fired for pretending Garfield s favorite food was Spaghetti I originally wrote this in the comments of this post https www reddit com r confessions comments jwulcn anytime garfield comes up in conversation i felt it deserved to be posted properly i used to work at an ice cream shop near a plaza and some docks my boss was from communist romania he loved to remind us he had come here and established his own business i was one of maybe six employees and was fifteen at the time the work was pretty awful the actual shop part was a breeze but once a week we had to unload a wheeler full of frozen duffle bags full of ice cream boxes only half of which had handles id guess the bags were maybe pounds each that s awful already considering im a teenage girl but the truck was also like and it was usually like outside so id go into the truck throw the bags into the back of a pickup and then get out and sit in the back while the driver took us about minutes away to the walk in freezer during that drive i d sweat but once we got to the freezer the sweat would freeze then melt on the way back then freeze in the truck then melt again i used to have icesicles coming off of my hat and ponytail the whole truck would take maybe hours with four of us we didnt always get four and we had to empty the bags and sort the boxes in the freezer with almost no light so yeah maybe the worst job ive ever had To be clear I definitely don t hate the guy man was one of the friendliest people I ve ever met but maybe he shouldn t have hired a teenager to help handle the really difficult parts of his business I mention all of this because context is very important here He used to sit in the back for the first half of the day doing computer shit criticizing us throwing things if we cursed near customers and during his lunch break he would eat a ham and mustard sandwich while reading the comic strip section in the newspaper and laughing like santa claus but his mouth was ALWAYS full after he left and we went into the office to grab the keys you could see the wall he faced that had pictures of his family on it just covered in yellow mustard spittle like a shotgun spread anyway if one of us walked past him during that window to take the trash out or go on break or something he would always pull us aside and point at it laughing usually saying the punchline that got him There was of course one glorious exception BAAHAHA THE GARFIELD CAT He NEVER pointed out the punchline I think he just liked how he looked or something He did say HE HATES ZE MONDAYS sometimes too but mostly he d just roar out GARFIELD CAT and lose his mind choking on his sandwich sometimes Anyway this time I had JUST gotten in from like six hours of grueling ice cream truck freezer dufflebag HELL and as soon as I walked through the door he GRABBED my shirt and pulled me down laughing splattering mustard in my face laughing about garfield Now at this point I was just about fucking done His breath stank I was sweating and shivering not to mention this was all for minimum wage I had done the garfield bit twice before but not so die hard I d fuck with them for a minute or two then burst out laughing This time it was WAR I burst out laughing too instantly winning me an oscar and returned volley AHAHAA the SPAGHETTI CAT He stopped in PLACE No more laughing no more mustard He turned to me genuinely shocked at my misunderstanding You not mean the Lasagna he asked I shook my head looking at him quizzically instantly snagging my second oscar No no Garfield s favorite food is definitely spaghetti He grumbled about it searched the paper but that strip didn t mention it The next day I came into work though he was VERY quick to grab me again pretty much YANK me over to the desk and point out that TODAY S paper had a picture of the lasagna that Garfield was eating unfortunately for him it did not have the word lasagna written I claimed it was spaghetti he was very visibly frustrated but then we had a rush and he let me go The next day same deal but this time it had it written I had the balls to just laugh and say Wow this is a really elaborate joke you re pulling on me and he went BALLISTIC NO the PAPER SAYS LAH ZAGG NAH NOT SPAH GET EE He was very adamant about it for the rest of the shift not even caring that customers were there but I acted TOTALLY unfazed by it I d scoop their cones and checkout all while he trailed me like HOW CAN YOU THINK THE GARFIELD CAT EAT SPAGHETTI THERE IS NO NOODLE and I d reply with some total BS and confuse frustrate him even more I finally broke near the end of the day HE STAYED LONGER TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH ME when he whispered to himself Does poor girl not know difference Her mother I just couldn t take it I laughed for like two seconds but he caught on I think his phrasing was YOU YOU HAVE BEEN A TRICKING ME and he started bellowing about it again We both fuckin cried about that for maybe an hour and we closed early Before I left he said I was Very funny girl but I was lucky he found out it was a joke because he was losing sleep over it and he couldn t handle working with me I laughed again and we said goodbye I got a new job a few months later with much better pay and less manual labor and he bought me some spaghetti from the pizzeria across the street as a parting gift on my last shift labeled lasagna Jesus that s a long post but it s one of my favorite stories glad to have it catalogued somewhere Hope you guys enjoyed reading haha,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of

A good life isn t meant for everyone some people have to suffer can we live with it Is it worth it Laurel Is what worth it Life is it worth it I don t know what kind of question is that I guess sometimes it can be and sometimes it is not but the times its worth living make it ultimately worth living I don t understand why it hurts sometimes One moment I m okay and then the next I am contemplating being alive It sucks I doesn t make sense that this is the life I got It s crazy how some people have it better than others and don t have to go through the feelings of loneliness not being able to connect with people having family that is only their cause they are your family Knowing that if you weren t related to them they wouldn t care a damn about you Having people not see you as someone that is worth it Being used and thrown away when it s convenient I m not living a life that everyone else is living I ve learned that people will use you to satisfy themselves whether it be family friends or significant others I don t even get to live to the lie of believing that some people will genuinely care about me I know how women are I know how friends are I know how family is Maybe I ve been given shit examples or maybe I ve been given the best ones Cause now I know I know that for some reason I am different whether that be for better or worse I don t know yet as of know it has been for the utter worse I m only At least that is what I say to make myself feel better People say that their teenage years were the best years you get to live carefree do dumb things you get to live Yet I haven t done any of those things I have always felt alone always been the outcast I haven t got to experience life I have just been waking up day by day hoping tomorrow will be different but its not I still wake up hoping that maybe today will be different maybe my life will change today I have been thinking that since I was in middle school and nothing has changed As I ve aged it has only gotten worse My new experiences have turned out to be tragic lessons I went through a severe depression period the third nine weeks my junior year for reasons I still don t understand Is there something wrong with me There must be right Why can I not be oblivious to things why do I always have to face the reality of the situation I can never trick myself into feeling better about a certain situation I always realize exactly what it is that got me there exactly the reasons for why it happened For example I met someone I felt like I connected with her we had a freakishly lot of stuff in common I felt like okay finally I get to have my person to get close to romantically then boom its was over in less than months It went to shit A damn pandemic hit I just lost her Instead of me being able to oh well its life I fully understand why it even happened in the first place I was used I was the rebound she had her friend group trashed by her ex she wasn t even over him she just wanted to forget she just wanted to hope things would go back to what they were with him She never wanted to like me she felt she had to like me Basically went cold turkey on me Am I not worth talking too You don t even care to know if I m alive I never could understand this and I still don t understand this So I ask a question do you even like me Seen but no reply What do I do I m hurting again Except I know what is best for me I know to leave Its what I m best at Severing the link I say I can t do this I really do want someone to at least like me in a relationship What do I get Text Although we are similar The more I got to know you the more I knew we wouldn t last and that s nothing against you Why do I even bother It s not worth it I felt terrible Not because I broke up with her I felt terrible cause is that is how she really felt Could a girl say we are alike but still not even like me How does that make since How is that even possible So many questions and I just wanted answers Yet I was so insignificant I couldn t even garner a response None to my text None to my phone calls Nothing Not even a drop in the water Why even bother Dodged a bullet anyway but maybe it should have

Physician heal thyself First off I work in healthcare and it s reached the peak for me at the start of the new year All the naive has been beat from me Nothing is going to get better about this system I came in with ideals and self preservation in mind I can help people and save lives maybe even spark change and I will have a solid skill set so that I am able to leverage my job as needed I m the squeaky wheel The squeaky wheel gets beaten into shape or drowned in oil until it stays quiet for ages knowing the price of making noise It got to me little by little And my counselor reminds me that this job doesn t define me and I need to be more than just my career when I think of my whole identity That s the absurd thing our careers have bred us to be the job to give our all to the job because not everyone can do the job just we few And fewer hold on long term And that s partially why We keep reverting back to our weak human forms despite the bumps injections and reindoctrinations of our God like ability and ego and hubris I am a failure I can only fight against this by truly letting go and it hurts so bad And the cure is not living day after day denying and downplaying I just want to end things because I can t take another psychological war fare because I stand up to the powers that be and cry foul I do it to protect my life and patients alike And my coworkers would rather sell me as sacrifice than pitch in and help I cant fix myself I can t fight the dark in me any longer I just want to be at peace,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
GreyLife is grey I remember a time when I used to see color I remember a time when I felt involved I remember a time when I could see a big plot in my head about how my life was going to go I remember when life seemed like a bright opportunity to me But as I grew older I came to realize that life is entirely pointless There is nothing I wish to accomplish I don t even want to survive I don t want to work I don t want to go to school I don t want friends I don t want partners I want to disappear from the rest of society like a ghost and just do what I wilt no more hunger no more fatigue no more authority There are some things I enjoy in my life I maintain a very active lifestyle and eat well I love rapping exercise and spearfishing That s it That s where my ambitions end I don t think I could ever make music my career because I don t want to go to school which you have to do if you really want to work with the technical side of music I write and write and sing and sing day in and day out another bar and another beer and another freestyle But it s going nowhere I m so poor I don t even know how to get anywhere with my music I have nothing to record it I don t know many other musicians I struggle to make friendships all I do is wander the streets of my little beach town getting drunk with the hobos and rapping People always love my stuff which always makes my day a little better But it doesn t pay the bills so why does it matter anyway money is the only thing of true value in the eyes of the human Unfortunately the majority of waking human life is a treacherous worthless fucking lie where you slave away to no end till you wind up dead like everyone else anyways No big party Life is not fun Human life is a miserable fucking struggle born out of a omnivorous ape growing too smart for its own good Life is not meant to be enjoyed it s made to be fought against till it inevitably defeats you in one way or another Maybe it defeats you with a bus or cardiac arrest or a fucking plane crash At least that d be more exciting than pathetically slitting my own wrists in a public bathroom so my mom doesn t have to find my dead body I m and I m watching from the sidelines as my peers get married go to school move out enjoy their pointless lives somehow I m just resigned to my tiny corner of life alone and having no place in this void I watch them and know in my heart I ll never catch up I never fucking will I was not born to survive this cycle I was born with a broken mind and a weak soul I try to express myself through music and poetry and it does help but it realistically gets me nowhere in this life other than impressing girls and wowing people sometimes I have no ambition I have no clear cut path to follow so I just wander into nothingness and twiddle my thumbs hoping something pops up from out of the fog of life It s a very hopeless feeling Love is the same thing every time you feel it the circumstances just change Hatred is the same thing every time you feel it the level of intensity just changes based on your perception I feel like after experiencing all the basic human emotions I ve run my course I ve had years to observe how this all works and I m formally opting out of it before the next cycle starts worse and more intense than the last cycles I ve run through I m weary and sick of repeating myself like I m stuck on a loop making the same mistakes burning my bridges anytime I build them lying around because it doesn t feel like there s anything better to do This life is boring and then hard and then more boring Fuck this shit I m out,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Last night I had a dream where this guy was trying to get me to cheat on my s o who is currently abroad I used to be a shit person unloyal bitch before I met my bf but even in my dream I knew it was not okay and it wasn t what I wanted even though it was just a dream and meant nothing I didn t even hesitate saying No I love someone else even after he kept asking several times It somehow made me really see how much I m actually capable of loving someone and being able to be committed without fearing it all There had been a few incidents where guys would try to push my boundaries irl while I was in that relationship with my bf I always ignored it used a stern no and walked away and I didn t put much thought of it But again the dream even giving me the opportunity to cheat without anyone knowing I really didn t want to regardless I am pretty happy with who I have It s a new concept for me to feel it seems sort of wimpy and stupid considering I should ve been more knowledgeable of it already and generally a better person I just wanted to share however,"Positive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium
Getting Worse Deteriorating Self WorthWas at the coffee shop several days ago that I go to so I can get out of the house and talked with a girl working at the counter She had heard from one of the other workers that I liked to draw and asked if I could draw I smiled and said yes She asked me if I could paint and I said that I could Nothing fancy of course I told her about how I ve been wanting to go to a place nearby where they have paint supplies to use there but I didn t want to go alone This girl responded with I d love to go I was in shock when I heard this as I m in my early s and have been rejected by girls since I first tried at I ve always been socially awkward and have just gotten more that way over the years from bullying and harassment I told her I was surprised by her response and how the previous girl I asked to go out there thought I was asking for sex and humiliated me in front of everyone in the store She gave a sad aww why and I told her I had no idea She asked when I wanted to go and I told her that my schedule is usually free so whatever time is convenient for her She said she would be happy to go at the first convenient time for her I was actually feeling somewhat happy just knowing I d be able to go out with someone and do something fun I told her she could have my number and just call me whenever she thought was a good time and proceeded to give her my number My anxiety since then has been really high consistently Fast forward a few days and I hadn t received any call or text so when I finally met her at the coffee shop again I asked her if she still wanted to go paint She told me she wrote my number down and misplaced it only to find it in her work attire She sent me a text to confirm the number and I added her to my contacts That girl motivated me to do more art in the coffee shop but my depression and anxiety constantly surround me days would go by until I gave in and tried to lightly bring up the subject of whether she had any idea when would be convenient for her Her response was I ve been really busy I broke down several days later and sent her a text saying that I was feeling really miserable and needed someone to talk to I thought for sure she was going to get irritated with me and finally just stop talking to me Her response was one of the kindest I ve ever had from anyone more so from a girl She offered to sit with me and talk after they closed the shop and she was definitely wanting to go paint with me I sent a few more texts about how miserable I ve felt just being stuck in my head and how I couldn t believe the kindness she was showing me compared to anyone in this life She shared her own experiences and I could actually relate to her At this point I started to fall more in love I guess At the end of the night we sat outside and talked I almost started crying while talking to her because the more she shared the more I could relate until another worker who I think was making fun of me for the previous incident with the other girl pulled up to us on his motorcycle and asked if we wanted to go to the nearby diner and maybe eat something I had to use the restroom so I gave in and said yes jokingly saying that if they have a restroom then sure I try as hard as I can to minimize showing any kind of problems going on with me just to avoid the anger I have from setting off stupid aggressive people We get up and meet at the diner where it s now of us including another worker and suddenly the one on one talk with the girl turned into a fucking group therapy session where the other two blatantly stated they ve never experienced the hardships I ve had to go through and shared their own stories I could see everyone was beginning to get progressively more depressed as I shared I couldn t bring myself to share everything I wanted to with the girl just to connect with her I wanted to so much but there I was locked in my fucking head fighting anger and sadness from overwhelming everyone It was about in the morning when we finally got up the guy on the motorcycle said he would be at the coffee shop to hear the rest of my story We had a small talk outside of the diner and since it was cold the girl was shivering and that one other guy not in a relationship with her opened his arms and held the girl to keep her warm I looked away and stared at the guy on the motorcycle while he talked but I couldn t get that out of my head even as it continued for a minute When I got back to the car I put my head down wanting to just disappear My anger and sadness was overwhelming partly from being unable to have a one on one connection with that girl and her hugging the guy was burned into my mind which brought more shit from my past flooding forward When I got home I sent her a message saying I shouldn t have agreed to that group sitting that it was extremely painful for me The next day when I went to draw at the coffee shop that guy with the motorcycle never showed up I could barely look the girl in the face and I sent more texts about how miserable I felt but there was no response until closer to the end of the day My depression from opening up was getting extremely bad Once again the responses she had were some of the kindest responses I ve ever received When I got home I had more conversation with her and I broke down because of her kind responses and her struggles in life were relatable Her kindness had brought my depression down and done more than any doctors or medications were ever able to I told her you helped me so I m going to help you I offered to help her pay the rent as a thank you for being so damn kind and bring me back from a bad place She refused and told me she was trying not to cry after hearing that and seeing the money At this point was extremely embarrassed standing there around other patrons and some of the other works I didn t think she understood how much she just helped me perhaps saved me so I insisted and she refused again So partly in anger I left the money on the counter of the coffee shop telling her that someone was going to take it if she didn t I was fully intending to do that because her helped meant the world to me and I refused to take it back but she came up to me with the money and told me she hadn t earned it and refused to accept it My response was how she had done more than any doctors or meds had ever done before I finally gave in and took the money back I got to my car and sent her a message that it wasn t fair how I felt useless when she refused my help I felt even more miserable on my way home I think I probably freaked her out after that incident I sent more texts trying to talk to her wanting to just be with someone somewhere NOT STUCK IN MY FUCKING HEAD Either that night or the next I left the house She had stopped responding to my texts Sent multiple texts describing how I had no idea where my life was going I told her I wanted to leave and sit somewhere to watch the sun rise I didn t want to be alone I was fucking tired of constantly being stuck in my head I wanted to tell her that I wanted to be with her more than anything All I could muster was just statements of loneliness What transpired after was me driving in the night until the sun started coming up I took some pictures of the sunrise and sent them to her with the message Even though you didn t accept the money please accept this sunrise as my thank you I was so exhausted for the rest of my trip back home from being awake all night I sent one last message saying I was going to fall asleep and hoped that her day turned out to be great There hadn t been any responses for the past day something she never let drag on and I figured at this point she either got tired of reading my shit or was simply busy as she repeatedly implied when I asked about going to paint Regardless I felt an overwhelming love for this girl and as I fell asleep I actually was able to drift off without too much trouble When I woke up several hours later today there was still no response since the night before I decided to not brood over negative possibilities and just go draw something at the coffee shop and try to relax as best I could with this depression constantly there I got to the coffee shop and the girl was there she asked me if I d gotten some rest which implied that she had read everything I sent Further more she said nothing about the sun rise photos that I sent her All she mentioned was me getting some rest I put so much effort into getting the photos of that sunrise there was a drunk in front of me at one point swerving into oncoming traffic Depression kicked in heavily and I ordered something before sitting down and drawing trying to tune out everything around me The two guys that joined us at the diner were working there today as well Through out the day I could hear the of them laughing and picked out several comments making fun of me I removed the girl from my contacts so she wouldn t have to see any more depressing things from me and I m sure there s not going to be any painting with someone else I felt myself shrinking further and further inwards Smaller smaller smaller nothing just not wanting to be here anymore I wrote in my sketchpad You asked me if I got rest that told me you read the messages I had to piece two and two together that I was talking to myself I removed you from my contacts so you don t have to read my stuff any more I thought the sunrise photos were nice If you care please speak to me in person Show me through your actions I let you in Invite me out ask me to hang out show me you care I want to cry right now but I feel a painful emptiness inside no tears just sadness Tired and sick,"Mental Distress, Positive

There s a bridge near my new house On Tuesday morning I woke up feeling exhausted My head was pounding with a headache my nose snuffed up my shoulders hurt my chest was tight my back was aching I cried I cried hard I cried about the rash consuming my legs I cried about how I have little meaningful relationships I cried about how I assume people think of me I cried about my job And my living situation I cried about being different I pulled myself together for a moment and decided to go to a walk in clinic Something I ve been putting off for months I went downstairs and jumped in the shower And I sobbed while washing my hair And screamed and yelled at myself and the world not through anger or hate but because of my inability to change or more so the self sabotage that I routinely commit I dried off avoiding my reflection in the mirror I microwaved some chicken fingers and drank a bottle of water I watched a YouTube video about a board game And then I cried some more I called the local mental health crisis centre where I ve dragged myself to in the past because they ve called me twice in two weeks and I haven t returned either of their calls I scheduled a meeting with a counsellor for two weeks from now knowing damn well I might not make it that far I don t have a doctor but I know what I do have and undiagnosed mental illness Or I m looking for a crutch Something to label myself so I know it s not my fault for putting myself in the positions I do At this point I was dressed and ready to leave my house I put on my sunglasses and headed out but I didn t head toward the busy main street or the clinic I started off toward the bridge A pedestrian bridge towering above jagged rocks and a river with an unforgiving current I walked slowly and confidently down the street toward the park housing the bridge My mind ablaze with the thoughts of ending it The image of myself laying upon the rocks for hours My lungs filling with blood Cold Scared But I turned at the last second Left instead of right And just walked for hours I walked until the road ended and I was exhausted Then I walked back on the busy main street Watching the people going on with their days Only stopping the get a pack of cigarettes which I had quit two months prior and a coffee And then I went home The thoughts are still there but I have them in check again To die another day,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

M Finally deciding to get my writing out there I made a website and am unbelievably proud of myself right now I ve been writing all sorts of things for the past year or so and kind of just letting it let me heal and think deeper about certain things It s done so much good for me mentally to get things out I cannot even describe it I lost my grandpa who lived with me in December and writing I was working on a pretty long piece already about something indescribable Life maybe and I ended up incorporating my grief and emotions and processing his loss through the piece writing helped a lot Especially writing about memories that I can go back and read and remember him like he s still here That piece isn t posted anywhere yet I m still going over it and adding and editing and processing One day probably soon I ll release it But that s just kind of a background to what this post is about I made a writing website where I ve posted most of my other pieces and am always adding more and eventually adding the one I mentioned above I used to be really into coding and put it down entirely a few months ago I was making video games not websites so the fact that I made an entire website from the ground up makes me really really proud It s nothing special but I like it And if any of you guys like reading or art you d maybe like what s on it I ve described most of my writings as essays about ambiguous topics that would be inappropriate to write in the standard five paragraph essay format and are way more properly represented through fiction storytelling That s just some Others I describe more like paintings I cannot paint or draw for the life of me so I use writing to paint I hope that makes sense Don t worry if it doesn t Anyway I ve rambled too much I d love talking to literally anyone feel free to message me or comment or anything you want I appreciate it Thanks for reading my post lt here s the site https www bjwiestwriting com https www bjwiestwriting com this is the first place I ve posted it so I m a bit nervous,"Positive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium

I m taking life at my own pace but I feel like my own pace is way too slow I recently reconnected with some friends of mine that I had to distance myself from so I could focus on getting better and mental health And talking to them again made me both more hopeful and far more hopeless They almost all have jobs they re still in school they just seem to be taking life at the intended pace Meanwhile even just talking to those select friends again was a huge step for me and even then I may have to distance myself again if my psychosis gets worse How am I supposed to get a job when I can t keep even in contact with some people consistently How the hell am I supposed to focus on an education when I m dealing with Tourettes psychosis OCD PTSD and shit like that I feel like I made the right step in contacting those friends again I feel like I m starting to get back on a steady track but it all just feels so hopeless still,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Lost all future prospects and have been on the edge for the past few days TLDR Title Hello all I ve come here mainly because I have nowhere else to go Some background I m a year old junior attending a Christian private school I ve been struggling with depression for a while but I managed to work through a lot of that and carry on with my life Now if this doesn t sound super terrible that s because it s not and honestly I have no idea why I m posting here when there are people with real problems but I m far enough there s no reason to stop now A few days ago I was caught sexting with a friend of mine by her extremely religious parents who then proceeded to tell my parents who are also fairly religious and it just went downhill from there It all looks really bad for me Even though we both participated I am seen as the main aggressor since I am the male and can be kicked out of the school that I have been attending almost my entire life Not only that but as she s a minor a few months younger than me which makes no sense but whatever I can be convicted as a sexual predator further ruining any prospects for college or anything afterwards as well I have no one to turn to My parents hate me for ruining my own and in turn their name and I only have one close friend who I normally bring this type of stuff to but she s the one I m currently banned from contacting I have no one I can trust or talk through this with and there haven t been too many moments in the past few days that I haven t been considering ending it out of horror at my actions and utter humiliation and if the rest of my grade around kids found out about this my only reason for hesitation would purely be the fact that I m a coward with no backbone repetitive ik but whatever I know that one of the reasons I m posting this is because I want to be convinced otherwise but I m so numb to just about everything at the moment that I would have absolutely no qualms with ending it I have no idea what to do There is no reason for me to keep going seeing as my entire life is now forfeit and I d rather get out without any more suffering on my part or anyone else s Also please ignore how pathetic this is,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

My own worst enemy was always myselfI ve been told how scary I am when I get angry and how broken I look when I m sad The anger and sadness have both dropped away now and all that s left is a numbness and a sense of singular purpose to escape No one took my first attempt seriously at the age of twelve despite my reason being I wanted to die I put a gun in my mouth but couldn t pull the trigger at age eighteen I knew something was horribly wrong before I got my autoimmune diagnosis for three years before I did anything despite leaking blood on a daily basis and even that was at someone else s insistence I stopped taking the highway to work because the idea of yanking the wheel over and smashing the car was a daily draw Had a complete breakdown at one job which led to my firing seven months to the day from my return Nearly walked out on the subway tracks to put a foot onto the third rail More than once I m past middle age lost my job I ve been fighting with insurance companies for a month to try to get the medication that keeps me alive I gave up Wednesday I m done I ve fought long and hard and I simply don t have it in me any more,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

One more attemptHello everyone I m a year old male and I have been stuck with this mental illness for over years now It s not getting better so that s why I have put together a plan and will hopefully finally somehow muster up the courage to go through with it I m truly just realizing how lonely I am in my life I have no one to talk to and I ve never had any relationship that I could consider that close People keep using the same It ll get better but honestly is there not an equal amount of chance of it getting worse I don t doubt there will be more good if I live I just know that the bad will ALWAYS outweigh the good no matter the amount I guess the problem is that I want the world to work a certain way and that s just not possible I m far too empathetic and care too much about a world that is indifferent towards me I ve always thought I believed in God but I guess I can never be certain I guess this is just one last call for anything Of course I don t want to die I m just getting very tired of it all A permanent solution to a temporary problem a temporary problem that keeps coming back again and again and again and will never leave me alone,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Paranoia controlled lifeFor the past three years I have been suffering from an extremely strange twist on my reality I still have not been able to explain well to others what exactly is going on in my head because even I don t fully understand I will start from the beginning with my best attempt to summarize the problem When I was I was self medicating with weed and alcohol on a daily basis There s no doubt in my mind that smoking pot plagued me with a lasting paranoia beyond the initial high or trip Say what you want about weed but the fact about it is that it can be very dangerous for some people It shattered my self esteem and I still feel like I am in constant danger At this same point in my life I was very isolated and depressed The most regretful part about this time is that I was self loathing and didn t realize how much opportunity around me there was to make positive changes In other words I was being a bitch about the life I had I am a lot better about this now and have no problem displaying positivity in front of others when I have the chance to do it I freeze up with nervousness in some social situations but I kicked the tendency to try to look sad for sympathy The subject of looking upset in front of others was not a completely new thing either Even as a little kid and teenager people would say to me things like what s wrong you look sad or you look like you are in physical pain what is going on or you need to smile more Also I have always had red watery eyes This led people to believe that I was stoned all the time even though I had never even seen weed until I started college I say this to explain that others have seen sadness or seriousness on my face when I am not trying to send off that energy and to transition into the beginning of the traumatic part At the job I had when I was self loathing I was purposefully looking down enough to the point where my coworkers thought I was actually crying I wasn t actually spilling tears because I had to work and didn t want to but I was figuratively crying about my life at work in front of others It took me awhile to figure out that people came to this conclusion but when I did I quit If I could choose a saying to apply to this it is definitely you got what you wished for I wanted people to see that I was sad and I got that in a way that was humiliating I was happy to be at work I really liked that job I had perfect attendance and took pride in my position with nerdiness Realizing that people thought I was crying over having to work made me panic to the point of having to hold back tears I let the opinion of others take control of me The next job I started was bussing tables I went into this job care free ready to forget my previous experience of regret and embarrassment I had already started to make an effort to act uplifted when I started working here Even when I felt comfortable and believed that I had picked a good gig because the restaurant speed and environment was enjoyable people thought I was crying over the work I swear I would feel totally calm and ask a customer if I could take a plate and they would be holding back laughter refusing to make eye contact with me When I realized this I became so self conscious about the way my face looked that almost every time a customer would ask me something I would feel like I was about to cry My face would twitch and my lip would quiver I never had tears streaming down my face at work but I would be on the verge of tears from the paranoia and panic This was an even more humiliating work experience for me because the public was there to witness and the town began to talk My reputation was completely stained with pathetic stories This same thing repeated with three jobs after this one After over three years since the problem first appeared there have been brighter times from then until now where the problem has not been fully surfaced in my every day life like it is now But it always creeps back in and pulls me down I still can not figure out if I looked so anxious and depressed that the appearance of my watery eyes led people to believe that I was crying What I do know is that I allowed it to push me over and become a reality Now it completely controls my life If I just talk to someone face to face it makes me want to cry Imagine just having someone ask you directions to a train station and becoming so overwhelmed with self consciousness that you begin to shake and tremble with a face about to weep When I walk down the street I feel like everyone will look at me and think I am crying So I always feel like I am about to do so It s not to the point of tears streaming down my face in public but it s everything that starts before that when anyone cries It s a cringed face quivering lower lip trembling etc I now live in NYC and just walking down the street is a horror Everyone on my street recognizes me as the young guy who you can see trying not to cry The delusional thoughts I have create the reality I can t think of anything more embarrassing for a twenty two year old male to be going through I am only still living because of the fear of hurting family and friends I would leave behind I think about jumping in front of the train a lot I go to a therapist once a week have tried multiple anxiety and depression medications currently tapering off Lamictal which makes everything a hell of a lot worse and the only thing that really helps are benzodiazepines Smoking weed definitely exaggerated panic in me and I believe this is why I am easily overcome with fear when people look at me A lot of the thoughts that would float through my brain during stoned contemplation would be self critical so I believe that those thoughts created an immense negative view of myself that I wrongly presumed people saw too It has been over two years since I bought weed but I have accepted hits every now and then Now I will completely refuse it because of the state of my brain To make matters worse I have used cocaine a little bit It was never an addiction but just an unhealthy choice I made several times which obviously did not help with paranoia Before I started getting high I was a bright kid and handled conflict well with my first job I knew how to handle customers yelling at me I would appreciate any stories of overcoming serious paranoia or advice on treatments that I may not know about I am trying to find some kind of practical coping method Thanks for reading a post this long edit I am new to reddit so any subs you think I should transfer this to would be

A weird post or situation I rly need your help now P S This is for a friend of mine he s eating my head over this and wanted some advice so thought I d ask the more experienced crowd over here Great now let s get to the post So a friend of mine started to rly like this girl who lives across the world from him told me about hrs from where he lives in TZ terms but rly wants to confess to her idk why since I know he s getting rejected anyway based on his description of her and his personality Also fun fact he did tell me they ve not even had a video call until now apparently she s kinda scared abt it as far as he told me So he took it to the levels where he did write an entire essay worthy proposal letter and asked me to rate it I have no idea about such stuff so thought I could give him advice from other people with much better advice than I could give So just give any advice on whether this pseudo proposal I m pasting below is any worth P S read the thing and apparently she s already in a relationship but he still wants to try so ig that exists Hey idk why I m posting this at this time of the hour but I really want to get this off my chest before it starts to mess around my head and I die of an anxiety attack I ve probably said this about a million times in this convo of ours but ever since this started I ve probably never felt better in my life in terms of emotional state and never expected a random DM of appreciation could go such a long way in terms of having a good social relationship But I think I m starting to like you a lot Now I can t justify anything I could do for you over your bf who you ve probably known for well over a couple of years instead of trusting a dude over the internet you met pretty recently but all I can say is that what I say comes from the bottom of my heart We might be polar opposites in every aspect of our lives from food likings to music to pretty much anything But you know what I m fine with that I could enjoy anything as long as someone close to I endear loves it too and takes a personal interest in it I m ok in having petty fights over such silly stuff as long as we don t take it too seriously Does help with having social contact in my opinion but it s kinda what kept me here for so long I really don t even expect you to agree to any of this at this point I kinda have come to terms with being solo in my life but you know what I kinda want to keep talking to you Irdk why I would ve ever said that but turns out it is kinda true Maybe it s just my kinda toxic relationship with people and where I was taken for granted But just this simple talking is all that I rly love about us I rly can t ever say I can treat you like a princess like most girls expect but I guess I could do something which might be one better have one loyal subject always at your service or help and do whatever I could for you But hey I just wanted to say this and I rly don t mind getting friend zoned at this point but I still want to keep talking to you Sry if I have ever done anything wrong in the past but I just wanted to say this I rly do like and love you Just hope we could keep this forever and at a more personal level I rly don t force you to any of this but just don t walk away from my life after giving me so much hope to live life to the fullest again P S I had to format what he sent had sent it in a single paragraph so had to format it a bit So it took a bit of effort so pls do read the entire thing and give your judgement Just tell how you would respond to it or how you would improve it while sending the message over He s sending this in text form so I do feel sorry for whoever is on the other side but I kinda feel that he s sincere about it Thanks in advance If he does allow me I ll probably post up the response if he allows me to in a follow up post but might take around few days he s not immediately giving this in,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium

Hopefully encouraging message for those suffering There may be no such thing as fairness in this life experience it s true some are more fortunate from the start You can tell yourself what did I do to deserve this I know at least once or twice in my life I have But lately I look at it this way someone is always going to be looking at my situation saying why are you not thankful because the situation I m in is so much worse they re right amp I can look at someone better off than me amp be right saying why are you not thankful but I have to look back amp remind myself why am I not thankful I do have things to be thankful for it s just too easy to lose focus when I m wrapped up in myself that s why I need to stop amp really be mindful of what s going on around me It s good to look for the positives I may have to live alone amp have a cat as company because not even family can tolerate me and I may have ibs which causes most food to be a nightmare to avoid amp be living with a heart condition mental health issues and a learning disability But you know what I can t change those things and the things I can change I should focus on instead I ve been trying to better myself lately you may or may not know this here but I do have antisocial traits and there are predispositions I deal with every day amp you may as well but it s good to prove to myself ourselves I m not what I was born as I m who I make myself into Growing up all sorts of things can ruin us in so many ways but it s good to get back up amp look for a way to get out or to fix what s going on I m not saying there are no hopeless situations but I am saying if you do have hope try to hold on amp keep going forward as mom always told me I hope this helps someone,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

The worst most meaningless life is still better than no life at all At least you still have the chance to do the things you love Even if it s only eating your favorite cereal in the morning watching that tv show book you love so much over and over again and waiting for the next sequel falling asleep while listening to the rain drawing at am while drinking your favorite tea etc etc I guess what I m trying to say is life is not to be seen as a whole Life is the little moments you love so much you look forward to everyday YOUR little moments MAKE life If someone would ask you what you love about life those little things would probably not even cross your mind because you see them as meaningless But then again what exactly has meaning in life Everything is meaningless Feeling content while doing the things you like doing is at least for me the ultimate form of happiness and meaningfullness And one can only be happy while alive,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping",Medium

I ve lost my sense of selfEvery day I feel like my life isn t my own I had purpose at some point and my life did feel like it was mine to live But now I wake up groggy and dissonant I try different forms of self help therapy meditation etc but nothing works I don t recognise myself in the mirror anymore I don t like the person I see I go to sleep in tears Sometimes with reason I can sort of get a grip on my feelings Other times I can t figure it out and I m just crying because I don t want to do any of this anymore I want to sink into nothingness Am I a coward for wanting to leave this world behind Am I a coward for not doing it already I m writing this and doing my very best to get through it I m avoiding the water works because my fianc is on Zoom on the other side of some ocean I can t remember the name of on her phone doing whatever she feels like and I don t want to let on that this is where my heads at A part of me truly wants to stick around But I don t really know where that part of me is lately and I know that sentiment doesn t belong to the man in the mirror I want to ask for help Someone,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping",Medium
My Story I Don t Want to Be Here AnymoreHello my name is Calvin I m a year old kid and I think I m done for good this time As far as my backstory I don t know where to start I grew up well had good parents and being an only child I ended up being spoiled as fuck looking back I wish I wasn t as it played into some bad mindsets later down the road but never mind that as I grew up life never had many issues until the early teen years and onwards Since then was an absolute downwards spiral there started my porn addiction loss of friends lack of connection with everyone in my life lack of desire for anything on the flipside when age hit the drive struck to turn all of it around since that point I started working on quitting my bad habits and made progress I have reconnected with friends I have started working on music that makes me feel fulfilled more than ever Looking back on this year the most things have happened this year than any point in my life despite the pandemic What went wrong Ever since three days ago something happened it was like the energy got zapped out of me Not just mentally but physically aswell Usually when I hit a low point there s always some sort of big spark that arises that inspires me to get back up again That spark hasn t arrived I ve tried everything in my power to build the momentum again Better sleep eating healthier working out everything that used to revive me in the past nothing Nothing is working I genuinely feel like my soul does not have the power to get back up again this time for good At this point I m looking for a quick way to end it I ve lost all interest in my hobbies relationships and myself I am ready to be done with this,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

What I learned from being a middle child is do everything by yourself because nobody will help you or even pay attention I rearranged my room and asked for help times because what I was moving was heavy my family ignored me My mom walked into my room this morning and said when did you rearrange your room Well I mean first she saw me do it and second she heard me ask her I mean there is also times she comes back with break fast and when I ask what she got me she responds with Oh I forgot to order you food and when everyone is eating food from a restaurant at home I m in the kitchen trying to find food Being a middle child sucks especially whenever I bring it up she always responds with I treat all of you the same She treats my younger brother like hes way better,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
I m not on SW anymore I will never go back to that dark place again but maybe this will help people who are currently in that bottomless gorge of terrible emotions That s the best way I d describe it it s a bottomless pit that you yourself keep filling up Once you fall down there you just keep thinking about the worst emotions outcomes etc I know because I was there The one and main thing that helped me and you hear it a lot is just do shit you love and outside of the depression situation try and force yourself to appreciate the little things in life it helped me to change my whole outlook on life Whereas I d sulk and get upset before I just laugh at it and I don t mean in a disguise the pain way maybe it started that way but now I generally don t care or end up thinking it s funny Look I m a legit ugly fucker I mean it s become funny to me after living with it for so long and changing outlooks but I can t even leave me house or walk into any room anywhere without getting stared at people doing double takes because they can t believe how fucked my face is and depending on the situation I can hear people saying cruel but sometimes generally hilarious things I d be a complete liar if I said it doesn t bother me at some level but I ve come extremely far from googling ways to kill yourself with no pain to now laughing at the source of my life s greatest pain I also just started ramping up my creative pursuits I draw write make music paint invent shit and in all that I don t even have the time to think about getting sad that s huge being idle gives you time to shit all over yourself and think about all the bad shit But the main thing I want to stress is start to appreciate the little things in life you have to force yourself at first I started off getting shaken up inside when people would stare at me or make funny faces now I ll just play peek a boo or blow them a kiss or do some weird ass funny gesticulation because once I started appreciating the fact and I know it s not what you guys want to hear in this headspace and I thought the same thing like how does that starving kid or the person with no limbs have anything to do with my current personal situation at least I wasn t dealt the being a starving kid in a rd world country card at least I can afford to do and buy what I reasonably want I m able to use all my limbs and brains how I want etc it made the fact that I m ugly as shit way less important Now I just want to have fun in life fuck wasting my and your time sulking This probably isn t the most coherent thing written because it s pretty stream of consciousness and didn t revise but maybe it ll help someone,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping",Medium
Is it harder to imagine humanity having a future I wasn t interested in anything set in space until I finally played Mass Effect after a friend recommended it to me I found out that shows like Babylon Farscape Firefly and Battlestar Galactica influenced Mass Effect Why was space sci fi more popular in the s and early s The dominant pop culture TV things of the s were Game of Thrones zombies and superheroes Space has come back on TV with The Expanse and For All Mankind but they are nowhere near as popular as the pop culture phenomenons even though Game of Thrones and the MCU infinity saga have ended with the Walking Dead concluding very soon Has it become harder to imagine humanity having a future What would it take to get society to dream of space again,Positive Coping,Low

Apathetic towards life Basically I m going through an intense existential crisis Can t sleep because I m thinking constantly about the meaningless and futility of human existence and the fact that nothing that humans treasure in this world actually means anything to me and that I would be equally as fulfilled spending the rest of my life in a small room living on bowls of rice as I would living the mundane life of the average American forming superficial relationships with other and climbing the corporate ladder until I either save up enough money to retire and play bingo with other dying people buy a beachfront property like one of those snooty rich white people you see on HGTV or be like the average american and work until I meet my inevitable death Even if I become a doctor the lives I save are going to end anyway Even if I become a politician whatever country I try to save is going to crumble eventually anyway Even if I become a writer my words will be lost someday and one day every trace of humanity s existence will be wiped out and forgotten Literally the only thing I can think of that I would dream of doing would be to travel the world and see as much of it as I can but even the excitement of that is being stamped out by the constant overflowing of information on the internet about the world Why save a shit ton of money to travel to Japan when you could go online and look at pictures read travel blogs listen to their music on youtube do a bunch of other stuff that effectively would ruin the excitement of your life experience There are so many people better of than you that you can just live vicariously through and even if you don t frequent the internet very often you re still bound to at some point feel like you re experiencing some form of sensory overload with the media constantly in you face all the goddamn time Everything just feels like it s already been said and done and I m pretty honestly bored with life,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Maybe I should convert to Christianity Or start taking meds I wake up and I seek validation until the day is over Until those beautiful hours of sleep when my thoughts finally become unbound from myself and I dream I dream of beauty and of splendor of hope and of love but the catch is I wake up The memory of who I am sets my brain ablaze from the minute that my eyelids open and the game begins anew amp x B The day is new and I exercise I run around my block like a madman and I lift my weights like a convict looking forward to that moment when I can stare at myself in the mirror I always hoped that one day I could wake up and never need to look in any mirror again But that will never happen I don t think amp x B My day continues I go to class chasing this lofty ideal of academia and professionalism but the truth is guys that s not who I am I am not some fine analyst of literature I rush through my assignments and readings like a woman rushing through a blowjob Even when I read for pleasure it is a waste I stare at myself in the mirror again and as I gaze into my lifeless eyes I wonder if they ever even looked at the words on the pages But thankfully that task is now over and I can move on to the next one It is now time for work amp x B I clock in and I seek validation From the big manager who drinks too much From the medium manager who smokes too much Even from the small manager who yells too much I smile at the women the old men I even smile at most of the young men All I hope is that they smile back But do you guys know who I don t smile at The hot young men I m scared of them They know that they re better than me they know that they re not gay They know that they had a real childhood And I know that they did too So I hide and I cower and I give them their change amp x B But gentle readers one day something very different happened to me amp x B One day at work I walked up to a grassy hill on my break I sat closed my eyes and meditated because somebody once told me that was a good thing to do While listening to the trees that I easily could climb and while sitting in the grass that I easily could rip out I heard something very different I opened my eyes turned my head and was now gazing into the face of a thirty inch brown falcon that was perched some fifty feet away For the first time in my life since I was a young boy I felt alive I felt powerless Deep down I wished that this falcon would fly to me and rip my flesh apart with its talons but it did not Instead it flew past me into the sunset letting me know that I was spared and could live the gift of life for another day I was elated I had discovered what it meant to be alive to be a mouse to be running away from a world of falcons I really thought I figured something out amp x B The next morning I woke up and I looked deeply into my betraying cheating belittling empty and gray eyes to see if there was any new spark that could revive me from this delusional hell of vanity self obsession and self preservation And all they told me to do was to run around my block again,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
I m a dick and drunk I really fucked up I was having a good time with someone someone who I enjoyed chatting with but I messed up I was supposed to be spending time with them but I got drunk I didn t realise my being drunk would upset them but I should of Anyone who was sober would have realised Who the fuck wants to listen to some fucking drunk rambling on I just didn t think and totally pissed them off I m trying to balance so many balls but what I failed to realise was that all the balls are already on the floor I m just pretending that I m still keeping everything in the air I m faking it so well I even began believing the lie The thing is this person for a brief moment when we chatted I completely forgot about the balls It didn t matter where they were I was lost in the moment but tonight I failed Being drunk ruined everything Now I m not writing this post for sympathy to make them feel guilty or as some kind of it s not my fault please forgive me crap My actions are my own no one else s I just want them to know that appreciated the time I spent with them That for the short time we spoke they made a difference and that I truly appreciated their presence however short and random it may have been Thing is this isn t the first time something like this has happened The common denominator Me There is no easy fix If my attempt had worked a few days ago then this wouldn t have happened I would have been forgotten like a dream I wouldn t have known their disappointment There are a few things I know for certain I wrote this for myself I m not looking for forgiveness In fact I hope they never find and read this They don t need to I m a dick A complete arsehole This world is better without me I will fix this I will erase my presence I will make everything right,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium

To everyone starting high school I know you probably hear this a lot but take that shit seriously Prioritize school above literally everything else because it determines your future and can mean life and death If you don t graduate you can quite possibly watch your entire life become a mess in less time than you can imagine Every little thing counts do your best at absolutely all of it ask for help if you need it and don t hesitate to be the best you can be The education system is absolutely fucked but unfortunately it s all we have and you need to get through it so you can move on to the rest of your life and keep going Don t let yourself get distracted I m not saying don t have fun high school can be the most fun time of your life but never get distracted from the fact that these very short years literally determine every second of your life afterwards,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

I don t know how I m gonna do it yet or when I am gonna do it But I m gonna do it I just can t take being alive anymore Usually I ll fall down and get back up But I m tired of the cycle It seems like every time I fall back down I just fall farther and harder My life has been consistently full of problems for awhile now but within the past week things have just gotten considerably worse Usually I can hide how I m feeling but this time is different I m wearing it constantly now At work customers are asking if I m okay at home my roommates keep checking on me I don t lie about how I m feeling but I don t talk about it much either Everyone assumes I m just slightly down this week My home life between all my roommates is going to complete shit My relationship with most of them has deteriorated beyond belief for the most part Out of of them there s only one I can say is still close to me The love of my life or atleast the one I thought was the love of my life has pushed me away I ve been strong and positive for her she s been my rock She doesn t even know how down I really am She knows I m depressed over her but that doesn t even scratch the surface of how bad everything is And honestly I guess she won t actually realize it until after everything is said and done I m always under so much pressure from my job roommates the chick I just can t do it anymore There s always something happening to where they have to depend on me for something very crucial And Without her I just can t do this Im not strong enough anymore Im broken mentally and physically at this point I feel like I m incapable of feeling anything besides depression and self loathing This isn t her fault fuck I d probably push me away too I fell in love with her and she doesn t realize that she was actually helping me stand It s just a combination of everything and very ill timed events that shows no sign of getting better I don t wanna hurt anyone else emotionally or physically I don t even know if me being gone is gonna have an emotional toll on anyone around me to be honest But I don t know when I m gonna do it or how but at some point this weekend I think I m gonna finally have the courage to try to end this shit show and hopefully be able to Rest In Peace for whatever comes next These years on this planet have mostly sucked I think I m finally ready,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

I got into a fender bender today For those that dont know a fender bender is a car crash which results in damage greater than a nick or scratch and always has damaged body panels pretty self explanatory I got hit from behind while I was at a yeild trying to merge into the flow of traffic Somehow the old lady who ran into me didn t know I was there and tried to force herself into the flow of traffic but I was in the way Fortunately I was working at the time and was driving around a company van so I don t have to worry about repairing my personal car The impact was at pretty low speed I was stopped and she was doing probably under km h mph so no one was seriously hurt The intersection that I got hit is a really badly designed intercession with big blindspots and lots of fast moving traffic so it wouldn t be uncommon for me to see an accident there once every couple weeks I drive around my home city delivering auto parts for a living so it was more a matter of when rather than if Still this was my first car accident either driver or passenger Scared the living shit out of me The van I was driving is fine it just needs a new bumper and a couple of new back doors The check engine light didn t even come on If I could properly latch the back doors I couldve kept driving it around and couldn t care less Her SUV was a little more beat up though as it looks like itll need a new bumper rad oil cooler a c condensor etc She actually took the plastic facia of my back bumper off and it was stuck in her grill when I got out to look I m glad that she didn t get hurt she was probably ish years old She was the first thing I checked on after I made sure that we were both parked off to the side of the road A young man like me can heal but someone her age would take a bit of effort to recover No witnesses decided to stop and help I guess they couldn t be bothered It s a shame but unfortunately not uncommon in my city For the first couple of hours after the accident my adrenaline was running really high I could barely write down the other drivers info my hands were shaking so bad so I didn t really feel anything but it s been about hours since the accident and now my lower to mid back has really stiffened up and is giving me some grief Don t worry though I ve already booked an appointment with my family doctor for tomorrow to see if any real damage has decided to show up Sorry for the rant I needed to talk to someone about it and get all the details out,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

My teenage years feel cut short because of and I wish so much time hadn t been wasted Just a quick warning I m just piling out my thoughts and they are depressing to say the least There might be someone who relates to parts of this maybe not Like everyone else I had plans for this year I was going to start living my life to the fullest and things had been going really well in my personal life so it seemed like that was possible I was almost out of my depressive episode I had a solid group of friends for the first time in years and was having successful encounters with my crushes Needless to say the year did not turn out to be what I d hoped I became depressed again fell into old bad habits and made new ones For weeks maybe even months I stayed curled up on the floor in my room staring blankly at my phone or the carpet Any significant object from pre quarantine like a playbill or a dress became a relic to be worshipped I didn t couldn t leave the house for months and even now I ve only been outside around seven times I can t even tell if I ve snapped but my own thoughts scare me now All my fears worsened When something good happens I break down because I know it will be taken away by the misfortune that sits on my shoulders Some days I don t feel anything and other days my emotions are on thin ice The worst thing about all this is that I ll never be able to get this time back I can live a good adult life and live it up but they won t be able to replace laughing with friends at the beach Going to the back of the school by the dumpsters to listen to trashy music Making stupid decisions Having the largest of your problems being you hiding the F from family you got while you try to fix it Things that aren t the same when you are an adult or a child So thanks for taking away the best out of the best and worst years of my life Wow that s depressing but hey I have an art prompt now so that s cool I guess,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

story again and the emotions in me seem to be running permanently on empty now that it even gets insulted by people who think their lives are worst than mine been through alot since i was a kid and up to now exactly beatings mental abuse social abuse psychological abuse majority of which were really unjustified and questionable that had me made into the quiet pacifist type of a person since i love writing reading and playing music instruments mainly things that interest me i do to the fullest extent but it left people particularly counselors with the wrong impression i got wrongfully diagnosed with being a sociopath and a psychopath since they found what i wrote was completely disturbing my hobbies too weird and different and my actions of being way too quiet be too creepy i was forced to change my being sociable with friends and my writings and research that i only reserve to myself that i primarily use to improve myself led them to believe that i was purely a psychopath so i got isolated more like quarantined when i come to think of it which led to even more problems got into a bad motorcycle accident and went through alot of beatings and tons of abuse i got serious trust issues and never go out now what is worst is that everything i throw at myself to improve my life like getting hobbies gets either socially abused or just be used for jokes or towards people particularly towards the women i highly admired such bad jokes and humiliations are started majority by my friends and continued on by my family leading me to be isolated even more that its not even funny nearly every solution and fix that i put out gets shot down telling me that its not good enough for their standards which led me to having really horrible trust issues with people now because some of them are being too manipulative particularly towards me and in the absolute mess of things the majority of the people who put me in this position either wants me to go back or forces me to go back TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT by me and even being warned that i m damaging myself past the repair point risking permanent ruin when i know i m already done for and did everything i could and that i am way too emotionally traumatized to be fixed disappointed at the fact that it took them years to find out that what they were doing were wrong,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Not sure if it s worth it I ll explain what I mean I m at a position right now where I can improve the quality of my life but don t feel like I should The entirety of my life has completely unraveled towards recreations that include alcohol abuse a stint of prostitution shallow friendships and destructive romantic relationships This year I turned and voluntarily committed myself to a behavioral psych ward one week before my birthday I left work early one day after a particularly stressful morning filled with whispers about my lax in productivity and drove my shaking and hazy self to the emergency room to tell them I thought about jumping off the building at work I got on antidepressants for the first time in my life and tried going to group therapy one week after I was released but stopped going a short time in I m an irresponsible and angry person down to my core I do understand a lot of people aren t completely without faults but I view myself as a fault In fact my past mistakes make me feel like I m tainted in a way Like my sins have made me unable to connect with seemingly normal people I don t feel like I have many things in common with the people in my day to day life I ve had FOUR jobs in these past six months and quit after a week at each one of them I left my own place to move back in with my alcoholic and childish mother who grates on my nerves I sometimes think I m just on a path to end up like her But lately I ve found work as a seasonal worker at a department store and use that to make ends meet I ve been looking for a second job to help my finances and for me to move away from my mother Everything was okay for these past two weeks until I called in to work yesterday and today My old habits have come back and I m just going to end back up sabotaging myself to unemployment and mental anguish I sometimes sit and for wonder if I ll ever learn to be a successful member of society Will I just live a life being paranoid and irritated by daily responsibilities and fear of being with other people I have thought about killing myself for around three years lately Ever since I dropped out of high school I ve lived an aimless life I m from a poor family from the housing projects so I ve never really experienced the atmosphere of stability or success I don t know if I want to continue living a life with no prospects It feels like people tell me it s okay and things will pass when they don t realize how tired and confused I am I took some of my mother s prescription pills in her cabinet to try and sleep the day away today I think about taking a handful of them to get it over with I mean my logic has become that I m going to die eventually so why not just do it now Things are not going to improve they never do Any comments are fine I don t feel anything right now,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Dear HumanityIt s funny how life works it really is the roll of the dice Some people live brilliant successful lives by climbing their way to the top Some people live lives of heartache and pain they then turn that into an art and become successful too Some people are just ordinary and blessed with a family or maybe just a single parent and they thrive and overcome the odds Some people are born with terminal illness mental illness disabilities and whatever else and they all succeed Then you got people like me people who tried everything they could and fought their way with everything they had only to not be enough Now here I am on this random reddit page venting this all out because I see no outcome other than death after this Treat people well treat people with respect treat those who are unfortunate and encourage them with love Give them a boost anyway you can and just realize that we all are just one single species at the end of the day The planet doesn t belong to us we belong to the planet If you have a significant other out your arm around them and say how much you love them because you never know what tomorrow will bring Make your significant other some food breakfast lunch and or dinner whatever you feel like you can do buy them flowers take them on dates make them smile and laugh help them feel motivated like they can do anything Most of all let them know you will always be there I was once so ignorant and arrogant that I thought I could help everyone Because I hate it when people are hurt and I tried to make it my number one priority to help others in anyway that I could because I thought we needed more love in this world I took on a responsibility that was impossible and I should have seen it coming but alas I allowed my own ignorance and arrogance to blind me That is my own fault and I take ownership for such foolishness Now here I am recovering from a botched surgery that should have killed me and to be frank I wish it did When I finally got better and tried to start again with my monthly disability natural disasters struck my hometown leaving many out of a home car everything While I was lucky in that regard the day after the disasters happened my car was stolen probably by someone who was desperate So here it is me years old tried to make something happen in my life now it has all failed Therefore I am officially a failure and I want this life to end I am now just figuring out a way how I wish you all well and just do your best in a world filled with hate hostility lies deceit and cruelty,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Stories of people mistaking me for adults Im quite big even though Im and from behind one could realisticly assume a late s early s man was standing in front of them This turns out to be really confusing for some people My dad and I were at a department store that was specialised for tech stuff and we were looking for a dongle for my macbook The store we were in was quite small and you had to squeeze between people most of the time this was pre corona As my dad and I were looking around I hear someone asking how much a terabyte cost Initially I just assumed a middle age man from his voice was asking an employee even if his question didnt exactly make sense hard disk or ssd presumably so I ignored him The guy repeated his question a few times but again I just assumed he was trying to get an employees attention and ignored him Now I was wearing a fluorescent shirt Mistake The employees also wore flourescent Eventually the guy got frustrated and tapped me on my shoulder How much does a terabyte cost Oh I dont work here I say revealing my baby face The confused look on the guys face was a sight to behold and he apologised for being rude We still laugh at this instance today even though its been a few months Never saw the guy again TLDR someone thought I was a store employee I was not My family were at a school function for my brother and at the end everyone went to dinner together For some context my hypersocial mom is friends with most of the parents and teachers present or should I say all of them The dinner starts it was all you can eat and some of the parents start walking around offering wine to other parents its kind of their thing they drink a lot Of course they arent exactly daft enough to offer alcohol to the students Eventually they come round to our table and someone taps my shoulder quite obviously talking to me would you like some wine I look around and the parent behind me burst out laughing They thought I was my dad in this story i was and roughly the same size as my dad My stature had struck again Maybe if they didnt drink so much they could have seen that I was my dad TLDR semi drunk parent thinks im my dad,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

It just seems like the right idea at the moment Hi reddit I ve lurked a while and things in my life have lately come to a fever pitch I feel trapped by everything and I don t feel like I live in a world where I m truly free anymore My relationships are burning me alive and even my friendships feel porous and deceitful I could use the kind words cause I know there are no answers I included my poetry I don t know why I guess to seem like an individual worth encouraging I can t escape the overriding feeling that everything in my life is rotting Thanks for your time I m a well traveled man with a stride and a plan to wander less near from so far But nothing I will see or ever have seen beats back the Big Bang in my yard See Williker Tidds who lived with his kids was a bootlegger hot off the south and when prohibition brought in inhibition Ol Williker whistled his mouth and said Jesus H Christ boy these people these people All looking for just a load off Now run back and forth and stay drunk on the sly While the cops they retreat from the law And though the money all goes up the expenses hose What if one could handle the weight Could one make such a still that its liquor would fill Every Sub Mason Dixon Line State Well Jehosephat Joe I know just where to go there s a rock that fell out of the sky And its shiny and hard and not an inch of its charred even though ten foot round the brush died And the sound it creates when you hit it or knock it is softer than you think it would And the air doesn t smell like there s burning in fact the scent surrounding s quite good But its steel like and feels like a distant vibration a rail for a train yet to come And its cold as a spring even though the damn thing is just cookin right there in the sun So he brought in a team and they all got the rock to sit stark on the back of his trailer And he hammered and blacksmithed and worked on great sheets of the asteroid thinner and paler And with tireless zeal and a few hurried meals Tidds fashioned a splendid machine And he stuffed it with grains and he churned up a batch that he knew would be sweet strong and clean But when the day came to cash in on his game Williker gasped cause he wasn t sure If inside of the still floating round in the mash was a light so bright and so pure that a glance would set ones imagination on fire and the soul too would in rapture burn For the colors contained in that shimmer or glimmer would take a gods mind just to learn And he swallowed and watched with a glow on his face and a helpless look right in his eyes He said Mercy what what is that and then went inside and turned off the light But at night he rest stubbornly and the thoughts in his head Ran around in insomniac roar And when he sat on the edge of the foot of his bed The light glowed outside of his door With a start he stood up and ran right to his still which emitted a casual hum and the light that shot out from the top of the tank lit the night like a placebo sun And his shout was so loud that was wife the old cow woke and waddled outside just to yell But the second she saw what dropped Willikers jaw then so too Etnas jaw promptly fell For the tank had been melting for quite a long time and the whiskey had boiled away And the brand new universe just sat there shining at the end of its very first day Theres a lot going on in universe spawn some things that you really can t know Like the sound planets make when theyre bumping and thumping as the galaxies they re inside grow And the trillion quarks making zillions of sparks as they bristle and crystal collide And the nebulas blooming and supernovas booming for young stars are too doomed to die And just hanging in air over two wide eyed stares the universe gained dimension and size And its growth was quite slow But quite steady and so in a year the Tidds moved lest they died For their house had been burned by a baby red giant like a superball coated with lava And their vase was erased by tiny black hole and some meteors got on the guavas And the living conditions grew dimmer and dimmer in the town where Williker lived And as land was devoured while men scattered and cowered People knew that something had to give For insurance adjusters had no clue what to write when the house was clearly just gone and replaced by universe golden and glowing and taking more insured houses on Then the government came with their titles and names and declared the small town a lost cause And in haste the whole state had to evacuate said the brand new ex states new state laws And for year after year the grand spectacle grew Until Tennessee was just an orb That hung twinkling high like a jewel in the sky Looking for a new state to absorb And slowly we retreat with the back of our feet hot from The Fires of Wondrous Creation But we all kinda wish that the need for the booze hadn t set up our own immolation For the commune we live in at the edge of the world while it numbers a billion strong Loses faith as the land that we have slips away and may be gone before way too long But there s hope in my heart for the world and its arts because the future is exceedingly bright For inside of the Big Bang the suns live so close that their day is no different from night And I m not really scared I m in love with my fate swallowed whole by the future constructive But maybe

Idk exactly why I m posting this My brain is befuddled right now but I got to just say something I simply cannot do this anymore so I m going to leave this place I don t know just how much more exquisite my dilemma can get I want to but I don t want to become a stumbling block for those around me I want them to be free of any emotional burden my demise might bring but how the hell do I get that right Okay so I ve considered trying to shed my fears and just saying fuck it and live my life Discover the real truth about our ancient past delve into some science like biology and astronomy also get into more philosophy and history Learn how to play an instrument or two and write some music and immerse myself into discovering and listening to great music Go travel and see ancient natural and historical places and have a few adventures Sample different cultures traditions and foods drink Ayahuasca hehe reach a fide chess rating of Do a few detailed sketches and oil paintings Read more great literature Write a few books Just learn and discover and grow Learn another language or two Help people who are going through crisis All the while just generally offering help wherever and whenever I can Live simply Live freely Just let go of fear and of the past just learn discover and love Live a spiritual life To what end For what What s the point actually Utterly given up on relationships already because I suck But I can t I just can t do it I ve never been to a psychiatrist or psychologist but I swear there s something wrong with me It could be some subconscious belief Are these limitations self induced Do I have a neurological issue Idk but I just cannot deal with this life It s just all too overwhelming My dreams are just dreams not because I lack the ability or the passion but because of something else Something unknown and beyond my comprehension Yeah I battle pretty extreme anxiety and depression I m sure never been to a psychologist or psychiatrist as I ve said but it s something else Something related to this world this system cruelty ego etc Something about existentialism So anyway here I am stuck in limbo craving and planning an exit but also reluctant to negatively affect those around me I ve got a date and the means now all that s holding me back are the people with whom I have some or other connection with and who I know will be negatively affected by my disappearance to the other side I have all these dreams and goals but I can t even do simple tasks like talk to people face to face without freaking out inside I just want to run away whenever someone tries to make small talk with me especially small talk God I can t do it I can t function I can t even keep a steady job I can t even greet a neighbour I can hardly even walk out the door I feel worthless I feel scared I m fucking paranoid about everything and I think I suffer delusions of persecution or something I feel dirty I feel useless and unworthy I feel not good enough I m rambling into the ether now aren t I nothing new nothing new Most things I ve left out like having lost people in my life and other stuff but ok Anyways So why the heck am I even gonna post this Is it reaching out Probably is right Um K I m scared of dying but I m also really eager and excited to get it over with I am just a waste of space and resources here I don t know what I m doing here Read about how some people who have had near death experiences their spirit leaving their body and feeling peace and well being free from fear or worries I really hope that s how it s gonna be Love all you good people I wish you all well,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Not meant for this worldI ve been coming to the conclusion that I was simply not made for this world I am irrationally empathetic especially with those closest to me I have a nature of literally only taking care of others and not myself and I get severely disgusted whenever I do nice things for myself Sometimes I ll go days on end of not eating or drinking simply bent on the thought of my desire to help and care for others My body can t take it anymore Shit hit the fan pretty bad for me when the virus started to break out across the US I was forced to move from the first place I had truly called home college It was my first year there away from an abusive and neglecting family that had abandoned me once before People genuinely cared for me at the college I was at and I felt a sense of well being that I had never before experienced in my life The virus ripped me out of my dorm and sent me back home to an older brother and father that are constantly on edge ready to explode The last and only thing I could put my hope in were my grandparents My grandma is the most loving and caring person I have ever met and she is easily my closest friend My grandpa always provided me the greatest advice and support One week back at home continuing the spring semester online I got news that my grandpa was hospitalized for a severe and complicated medical condition To add on my grandma s knees gave out and she too was hospitalized for a close to death heart attack I immediately went over to be with them in the hospital and I would go on to take care of them back at their home for the rest of the semester It was by far the most stressful time of my life Having to stay on top of schoolwork provide consistent care for my grandparents and manage my own health heart and mental issues was extremely difficult But I was more than willing to do anything for my grandparents because of all that they had done for me After a tragic fall and a brutal season of hospice my grandpa passed At that point I couldn t take it any more I promised myself years ago that the pain I felt after my other grandpa passed I was not going to go through it again I was going to do whatever it took to not have to bear with another loved ones death And so here I am now I was not strong enough to care for my grandpa and I failed him I failed my grandma for not being the kind of support that she needed I don t deserve the right to live because of my faults I ve just been so numb ever since he passed that I completely have no idea what to do,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Things are getting weirdI ve been formally diagnosed with anxiety but not depression since the diagnosis was a long time ago and I haven t been able to go to a doctor since insurance problems I kind of see my emotions as waves and notice that the highs don t last as long and the lows are getting more intense It s like every time I start to feel healthy and motivated I know in the back of my mind it won t last more than a few days to a week But something weird is happening this time Ive been feeling very paranoid these last few days like I m constantly missing something I haven t slept right I ve been sleeping for too long but I m constantly waking up nervous and anxious in the middle of the night I m even starting to hear things that aren t there I don t know how else to describe it I used to eat emotionally now I fluctuate between overeating and not eating or drinking for days But the paranoia is the worst like when you have a weird feeling that something bad is about to happen or when you forget something important It s been lingering constantly for the past few days Everything s lost meaning I feel foggy and hopeless There isn t any point in going to seek help and pay out of pocket I won t be able to afford it There isn t any meaning to much of anything these days,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium
Lookin for Some AdviceHey so I ve been pretty down for as long as I can remember Always seem to feel out of place unless I m sitting around by myself I have several groups of friends which don t interact with eachother in any way but still I always feel like a loner There are the typical depressed feelings like being a burden or that somehow in someway things are just better without me but my family was usually there to disperse those At the end of last semester I was dismissed from college and had to move home School is fairly easy for me but I have grown so apathetic that I simply stopped going to class For whatever reason upon moving home I decided it was a good idea to tell my family that I smoke weed I tried to explain that it helps me to just get out of my head and let go of my anxieties but they all still treat me like I m some big drug addict burn out They may be right although I really dont feel so Also my girlfriend broke up with me but still works at my families restaurant I really didnt want the relationship to end and she seems like she doesnt either I feel like she is scared of me I have been good at being alone for most of my years but now I cant seem to stop thinking about it I cant shake this terrible anxiety that I feel is constantly circling me I have been to doctors and psychiatrists and am on several different medications to attempt to remedy this but nothing seems to work I feel like dying would be a great solution for everyone but I dont really feel like killing myself It seems like it is too easy of a way out for me and I would just be leaving behind all of my messes for someone else At the same time I would love to die I dont know I suppose this was a bit of an unorganized rant more than anything but if anyone has any advice or anything really it would be greatly appreciated,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium
My current greatest love that I had just broke me This is a thing I made on why I liked her and the last part is added just now She was the one with the idea to date she made the first move It s always a great thing when the other makes the first move because half the job is done I guess Someone who s smart pretty has her glasses just a little crooked ya know someone who doesn t go for a guy like me Scout talking about Ms Pauly She s different in a good way by making me get butterflies we always have a laugh and shooting the shit pardon for language we interact like I ve never seen before From all that I ve observed and all that I ve done myself I ve never had the kind of interactions we have She isn t the most stable person but then again who the hell is I ll admit I m not always She s more human i guess she s kinda country and she has that way I don t know how to describe it because its never been in my life before She makes me just smile I don t know if that s what love really is because it s always subjective but if I care about someone as much as to write why I feel this way and offer myself to contribute to their furthering of their happiness then maybe that s it It s just too bad she doesn t see me this way because I feel like if she took steps to get herself to happiness and I felt she was happier with me because she had the calm she wanted and she just seemed more open and happy with us together I just want her to be happier and for her to give us another shot No one has made me feel this impacted by such a loss no ex has made me feel so well shitty maybe the alcohol didn t help that evening and the massive hangover the next day but sorry God damn do I wanna change her happiness and us I want us to have both the emotion and our friendship where we can cuddle and laugh at a literal bucket of chicken when we can talk about sex and then make fun of me having an erection from talking about it It isn t possible though at least before she is happy again I know she said yes because she wanted to make me happy and she wasn t as happy as she wanted I wanted to make her happy and I was pretty happy I wasn t sure why that is but I just think its because of her mental stuff which i can t fix I m not Hercules I think you mean Hunkules I m not a god I wish I could help but sometimes I can only listen But she sometimes won t want me to listen because of her boundaries Her boundaries are what I guess bug be about our new change not the sexual boundaries but the emotional boundaries that are reset due to the mental hospital s somewhat manipulation I hate using this word so sorry but convincing her that us was bad Bad grammar She likes another guy now which just broke me I m crying in my bed right now and feeling just sick in my chest and stomach and it just sucks I just want to end it and think to myself who the fuck cares and I know people will I just sometimes wish someone would ask me about this whole thing,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
I m going to be meeting with a friend in eight hours but I m not sure I can pretend today I ve been doing well but have had a small relapse of sleep deprived madness the past few days I m not being hyperbolic either you would be appalled at how I have been conducting myself in private Usually when we hang out it brings me such joy and I can match the energy I am kind and friendly in the most genuine ways but I deliberately avoid showing even the slightest sign that anything is wrong Why Because she s a girl That reasoning might make you upset That s fair honestly I ve just found that on a subconcious level girls will only tolerate negative emotion from other girls There s probably other factors at work of course and I desperately want to be wrong but Gathering more evidence isn t worth the risk But it seems like that will happen today anyway She will know something is wrong and perhaps she will ask No matter how much I refuse it is inevitable I will let something slip She s a very smart girl so it s decently likely she may be aware of her instincts and be able to compensate for them but again I don t want to take that risk At any moment she could cut off contact badmouth me to mutual acquaintances and disappear She knows where I live but the same can t be said for the reverse She must never find out how lonely I am must never find out she is my only true friend must never find out how desperately I need a literal shoulder to cry on I want to be vulnerable but I have too much to lose,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

GreyLife is grey I remember a time when I used to see color I remember a time when I felt involved I remember a time when I could see a big plot in my head about how my life was going to go I remember when life seemed like a bright opportunity to me But as I grew older I came to realize that life is entirely pointless There is nothing I wish to accomplish I don t even want to survive I don t want to work I don t want to go to school I don t want friends I don t want partners I want to disappear from the rest of society like a ghost and just do what I wilt no more hunger no more fatigue no more authority There are some things I enjoy in my life I maintain a very active lifestyle and eat well I love rapping exercise and spearfishing That s it That s where my ambitions end I don t think I could ever make music my career because I don t want to go to school which you have to do if you really want to work with the technical side of music I write and write and sing and sing day in and day out another bar and another beer and another freestyle But it s going nowhere I m so poor I don t even know how to get anywhere with my music I have nothing to record it I don t know many other musicians I struggle to make friendships all I do is wander the streets of my little beach town getting drunk with the hobos and rapping People always love my stuff which always makes my day a little better But it doesn t pay the bills so why does it matter anyway money is the only thing of true value in the eyes of the human Unfortunately the majority of waking human life is a treacherous worthless fucking lie where you slave away to no end till you wind up dead like everyone else anyways No big party Life is not fun Human life is a miserable fucking struggle born out of a omnivorous ape growing too smart for its own good Life is not meant to be enjoyed it s made to be fought against till it inevitably defeats you in one way or another Maybe it defeats you with a bus or cardiac arrest or a fucking plane crash At least that d be more exciting than pathetically slitting my own wrists in a public bathroom so my mom doesn t have to find my dead body I m and I m watching from the sidelines as my peers get married go to school move out enjoy their pointless lives somehow I m just resigned to my tiny corner of life alone and having no place in this void I watch them and know in my heart I ll never catch up I never fucking will I was not born to survive this cycle I was born with a broken mind and a weak soul I try to express myself through music and poetry and it does help but it realistically gets me nowhere in this life other than impressing girls and wowing people sometimes I have no ambition I have no clear cut path to follow so I just wander into nothingness and twiddle my thumbs hoping something pops up from out of the fog of life It s a very hopeless feeling Love is the same thing every time you feel it the circumstances just change Hatred is the same thing every time you feel it the level of intensity just changes based on your perception I feel like after experiencing all the basic human emotions I ve run my course I ve had years to observe how this all works and I m formally opting out of it before the next cycle starts worse and more intense than the last cycles I ve run through I m weary and sick of repeating myself like I m stuck on a loop making the same mistakes burning my bridges anytime I build them lying around because it doesn t feel like there s anything better to do This life is boring and then hard and then more boring Fuck this shit I m out,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

My little brother likes to get drunk and put guns to his head I need your advice Hi guys So my little brother is years old and he is not doing too well He is always very angry and sad because he feels like his life is useless and that he has no self worth Due to his criminal history it s hard for him to find jobs in the fields that he is interested in so he mostly stays home A lot of his anger is related to the things people say to him He s been called lazy stupid piece of shit and every other insult you can think of and mostly coming from his girlfriend of years parents They laugh at him and mock him because she makes more money than him At this point he keeps talking to me and telling me that he feels like he has no purpose and that he feels like life is not for him In trying to help him and talk to him I find myself feeling very sad and scared that he is going to do something that he will regret Yesterday he went on an alcohol binge and was putting a gun to his own head not to mention this is a frequent event that occurs I don t know how to help him He is very proud and I don t know if he would be open to receiving therapy What do I do How do I help him I m so lost and confused because I feel like the advice I give him doesn t have an effect I appreciate your guys feedback,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Paranoia controlled lifeFor the past three years I have been suffering from an extremely strange twist on my reality I still have not been able to explain well to others what exactly is going on in my head because even I don t fully understand I will start from the beginning with my best attempt to summarize the problem When I was I was self medicating with weed and alcohol on a daily basis There s no doubt in my mind that smoking pot plagued me with a lasting paranoia beyond the initial high or trip Say what you want about weed but the fact about it is that it can be very dangerous for some people It shattered my self esteem and I still feel like I am in constant danger At this same point in my life I was very isolated and depressed The most regretful part about this time is that I was self loathing and didn t realize how much opportunity around me there was to make positive changes In other words I was being a bitch about the life I had I am a lot better about this now and have no problem displaying positivity in front of others when I have the chance to do it I freeze up with nervousness in some social situations but I kicked the tendency to try to look sad for sympathy The subject of looking upset in front of others was not a completely new thing either Even as a little kid and teenager people would say to me things like what s wrong you look sad or you look like you are in physical pain what is going on or you need to smile more Also I have always had red watery eyes This led people to believe that I was stoned all the time even though I had never even seen weed until I started college I say this to explain that others have seen sadness or seriousness on my face when I am not trying to send off that energy and to transition into the beginning of the traumatic part At the job I had when I was self loathing I was purposefully looking down enough to the point where my coworkers thought I was actually crying I wasn t actually spilling tears because I had to work and didn t want to but I was figuratively crying about my life at work in front of others It took me awhile to figure out that people came to this conclusion but when I did I quit If I could choose a saying to apply to this it is definitely you got what you wished for I wanted people to see that I was sad and I got that in a way that was humiliating I was happy to be at work I really liked that job I had perfect attendance and took pride in my position with nerdiness Realizing that people thought I was crying over having to work made me panic to the point of having to hold back tears I let the opinion of others take control of me The next job I started was bussing tables I went into this job care free ready to forget my previous experience of regret and embarrassment I had already started to make an effort to act uplifted when I started working here Even when I felt comfortable and believed that I had picked a good gig because the restaurant speed and environment was enjoyable people thought I was crying over the work I swear I would feel totally calm and ask a customer if I could take a plate and they would be holding back laughter refusing to make eye contact with me When I realized this I became so self conscious about the way my face looked that almost every time a customer would ask me something I would feel like I was about to cry My face would twitch and my lip would quiver I never had tears streaming down my face at work but I would be on the verge of tears from the paranoia and panic This was an even more humiliating work experience for me because the public was there to witness and the town began to talk My reputation was completely stained with pathetic stories This same thing repeated with three jobs after this one After over three years since the problem first appeared there have been brighter times from then until now where the problem has not been fully surfaced in my every day life like it is now But it always creeps back in and pulls me down I still can not figure out if I looked so anxious and depressed that the appearance of my watery eyes led people to believe that I was crying What I do know is that I allowed it to push me over and become a reality Now it completely controls my life If I just talk to someone face to face it makes me want to cry Imagine just having someone ask you directions to a train station and becoming so overwhelmed with self consciousness that you begin to shake and tremble with a face about to weep When I walk down the street I feel like everyone will look at me and think I am crying So I always feel like I am about to do so It s not to the point of tears streaming down my face in public but it s everything that starts before that when anyone cries It s a cringed face quivering lower lip trembling etc I now live in NYC and just walking down the street is a horror Everyone on my street recognizes me as the young guy who you can see trying not to cry The delusional thoughts I have create the reality I can t think of anything more embarrassing for a twenty two year old male to be going through I am only still living because of the fear of hurting family and friends I would leave behind I think about jumping in front of the train a lot I go to a therapist once a week have tried multiple anxiety and depression medications currently tapering off Lamictal which makes everything a hell of a lot worse and the only thing that really helps are benzodiazepines Smoking weed definitely exaggerated panic in me and I believe this is why I am easily overcome with fear when people look at me A lot of the thoughts that would float through my brain during stoned contemplation would be self critical so I believe that those thoughts created an immense negative view of myself that I wrongly presumed people saw too It has been over two years since I bought weed but I have accepted hits every now and then Now I will completely refuse it because of the state of my brain To make matters worse I have used cocaine a little bit It was never an addiction but just an unhealthy choice I made several times which obviously did not help with paranoia Before I started getting high I was a bright kid and handled conflict well with my first job I knew how to handle customers yelling at me I would appreciate any stories of overcoming serious paranoia or advice on treatments that I may not know about I am trying to find some kind of practical coping method Thanks for reading a post this long edit I am new to reddit so any subs you think I should transfer this to would be appreciated,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Hey there Thinking about killing myself So I ve been depressed for a long time first time I felt like this I was years old I m now It kinda comes and goes I m on my final year of university and although I got good grades I don t think I can finish this year which I would be terribly sad if I didn t and it s what s likely to happen Studying is one of the few things I enjoy doing but when I m depressed I can t even read a paragraph before thinking about killing myself I ve been trying to fake it till you make it approach since my first year I m popular around campus throw a lot of parties I m not bad looking and I pretend not to be shy so socially I m really good at pretending to be a extovert outgoing guy Though my friends have been suspecting that my heavy drinking and drug use is a excuse to hide something else an assumption which they are more likely correct I like people I feel an empathy that is abnormal which is a recurring issue in making me depressed If I see someone sad or miserable looking I instantly feel how I think that person is feeling hollow I could be the richest most sucessful best looking person in the world I would still be depressed there s nothing that can change this I just don t like life and I fail to see any way that it would be better Although I might feel empathy I can t actually like anyone I can t love anyone that I ve found in my live I hate being around my friends and family and I hate to pretend I enjoy it They are good people but it s annoying to be around people that don t understand not depression but how meaningless is anything they say or do Nothing makes any sense The only thing that keeps me going is that I only get one living it s obvious I will have a happy day in my life actually I bet I still haven t lived my happiest day But is it worth it Would you live your life as a begger just because you know that in your last day you would be a billionaire I m thinking about just jumping I don t think there s anything for me here Only in my sleep I find peace,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium
I now have a gun and I dont know how much longer Ill be here The past years or so Ive had consistent thoughts of death Sometimes its in the back of my mind other times its the only thing I can focus on I feel completely isolated which is my fault and I have zero hope that I ll ever have the tools or knowledge to be happy Ive came close a few times I ve been hospitalized but all its really come down to is the Dr saying Here are a few options of pills you can take and Ive tried several and they all just dont work Ive never been able to explain what these pills do to me but they do not take away the pain of just being forced to live I feel like I have no family by the common definition My parents divorced because my father is emotionally abusive my siblings all got into heavy drugs and left my mom just gave up and dropped me off at my dads one day and moved away and I only hear or see her a few times a year on a good year I dont think she really thinks much of me My relationship with my father is awful And I can t blame him for all of it He has been emotionally and sometimes physically abusive to me but at the same time Ive given him reasons to be Ive been a failure for so long Ive struggled to hold a job I do drugs far more than I should and Ive stolen alcohol and pills from him before because I cant deal with the pain that I create for myself But now I dont feel so forced to be this way because I can be dead Im scared of death I feel like we all are Becoming nothing is a hard thought to accept but living has become even more terrifying and It takes more strength to live than It does to die strength that I feel like I ve run out of Ive noticed it does feel different going about my life with the gun under my bed Its almost easier getting out of bed now and doing small things knowing that I am not forced to endure the same pain tomorrow making every effort feel pointless The next time I am feeling this unreal pain or nothing at all Ill go out into the woods and put a bullet into my brain It s funny because I have a doctors appointment on the first of next month because I want to talk to him about seeing a specialist for my problems But now that I have a way out I no longer care much for the idea of trying to fix myself and failing like I always have I have my solution right here,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
I think a restaurant I went to a year ago was sexist For context I m a male I went to this restaurant in my city for my aunt and uncle s wedding anniversary The food wasn t bad I had to go to the bathroom and this is February so pre virus restrictions There were three dudes waiting in line so I waited behind them The bathroom setup went like this There was a women s bathroom and an all gender bathroom I thought it was weird that there was no men s bathroom As I waited for the three dudes to finish up I think six or seven women passed me and used the bathroom in the women s room I got a peek inside the women s bathroom I didn t go in but from the view I got it looked like a nice and modern bathroom with two stalls a flower pot with fake flowers and mints Then the guy in front of me stepped out and I stepped into the all gender bathroom It was crap The tile had cracks and was crappy There was one toilet and a sink and the bathroom in general was dirty The broom and dustpan were still in there too The toilet had some scratches and so did the mirror The entire time as I sat there taking a dump I was thinking what the fuck The fact that the women got their own restroom which was nice and clean and had two stalls and the men were stuck with an all gender bathroom which was crap just pissed me off so much If I m being sexist let me know but I just think this is outrageous this is unfair,Maladaptive Coping,Medium

The worst most meaningless life is still better than no life at all At least you still have the chance to do the things you love Even if it s only eating your favorite cereal in the morning watching that tv show book you love so much over and over again and waiting for the next sequel falling asleep while listening to the rain drawing at am while drinking your favorite tea etc etc I guess what I m trying to say is life is not to be seen as a whole Life is the little moments you love so much you look forward to everyday YOUR little moments MAKE life If someone would ask you what you love about life those little things would probably not even cross your mind because you see them as meaningless But then again what exactly has meaning in life Everything is meaningless Feeling content while doing the things you like doing is at least for me the ultimate form of happiness and meaningfullness And one can only be happy while alive,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping",Medium

I see no real reason to go onI ve only lived years and in those years theres only heartbreak and troubles The majority of my family have suffered from depression and terrible anxiety as I have They usually turned to street drugs like meth heroin and weed Which I know weed isn t too bad but still anything like those are not the solution My emotions range from incredibly happy to miserable I m failing school because of my lack of motive and my constant nihilism I hate to play victim or blame my troubles on outside forces I feel as if lifes only going to get worst and I should just end it I failed french and I have to drop it v v I have a stream of absents from school as well thats most likely going to lead to my family going to court And if it does the day before court I ll or the day we get the letter calling for attendance I plan on shooting myself,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Not sure if it s worth it I ll explain what I mean I m at a position right now where I can improve the quality of my life but don t feel like I should The entirety of my life has completely unraveled towards recreations that include alcohol abuse a stint of prostitution shallow friendships and destructive romantic relationships This year I turned and voluntarily committed myself to a behavioral psych ward one week before my birthday I left work early one day after a particularly stressful morning filled with whispers about my lax in productivity and drove my shaking and hazy self to the emergency room to tell them I thought about jumping off the building at work I got on antidepressants for the first time in my life and tried going to group therapy one week after I was released but stopped going a short time in I m an irresponsible and angry person down to my core I do understand a lot of people aren t completely without faults but I view myself as a fault In fact my past mistakes make me feel like I m tainted in a way Like my sins have made me unable to connect with seemingly normal people I don t feel like I have many things in common with the people in my day to day life I ve had FOUR jobs in these past six months and quit after a week at each one of them I left my own place to move back in with my alcoholic and childish mother who grates on my nerves I sometimes think I m just on a path to end up like her But lately I ve found work as a seasonal worker at a department store and use that to make ends meet I ve been looking for a second job to help my finances and for me to move away from my mother Everything was okay for these past two weeks until I called in to work yesterday and today My old habits have come back and I m just going to end back up sabotaging myself to unemployment and mental anguish I sometimes sit and for wonder if I ll ever learn to be a successful member of society Will I just live a life being paranoid and irritated by daily responsibilities and fear of being with other people I have thought about killing myself for around three years lately Ever since I dropped out of high school I ve lived an aimless life I m from a poor family from the housing projects so I ve never really experienced the atmosphere of stability or success I don t know if I want to continue living a life with no prospects It feels like people tell me it s okay and things will pass when they don t realize how tired and confused I am I took some of my mother s prescription pills in her cabinet to try and sleep the day away today I think about taking a handful of them to get it over with I mean my logic has become that I m going to die eventually so why not just do it now Things are not going to improve they never do Any comments are fine I don t feel anything right now,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

NSFW Please help meI m and I stayed over my friends house but I stayed downstairs on the sofa because his room is quite small and the sofa would just be comfier I was struggling to sleep because I wasn t that tired and I usually go to bed much later than that in my own house His brother came downstairs I think he s or or something and I could hear him in the kitchen getting a drink or something but then I could hear he came into the dining room bit so he would have been able to see me and he just stayed in the area for a bit and went back into the kitchen He eventually came over to me and I thought he was just getting something from the living room so I just pretended to be asleep but then he said my name really quietly which I just ignored but he said it again so I was thinking what is he doing but still pretended to be asleep because I didn t know what else to do Then he put his hand on my chest and shook me a tiny bit and then went back into the kitchen for something He eventually came back in said my name again and then put his hand under the blanket and on my d ck which was getting hard at this point and idk why because I was nervous and shaking a little bit which I m surprised he didn t notice He was rubbing it a bit and eventually put his hand under my boxers but I turned over onto my side and he went back into the kitchen He was in there for a while doing something idk what he was doing and then he came back in and put his hand down my boxers again but this time my ass because my d ck was facing away from him I didn t know what to do anymore because I couldn t turn the other way again so I had to just let him and he started licking my ass and stuff and I just felt so awkward He went to put his finger up there but that was even worse than him touching my d ck so I just turned back around so I was laying on my back again He didn t even go back into the kitchen this time he just sat on the floor for a bit and then touched my d ck again wanking it and sucking it Then he moved my hand onto his and used my hand to wank his Eventually I came but I didn t enjoy it that much because it was so awkward He kept sucking me off after I had and wanked himself again with my hand until he came too and then he just licked everything up from my belly and went to sleep and I didn t sleep again all night I don t have any parents to tell because they died in a car crash a few years ago and so I just live with my grandad and I know he s someone that would go crazy and make it so awkward for me and I wouldn t be able to see my friend again and he s my closest friend in school My grandad is really ill too so I don t want him to have this as the last experience of his life but I need to tell someone and I didn t know where to post it so I found this page on Google I don t want to ruin my friends life but I haven t been able to sleep much since and can t concentrate on school work at all like I just stare into space mostly in classes and haven t seen my friends in a couple of weeks I ve just been pretending I m busy decorating my bedroom recently but I m just never in the mood to see them anymore I just think my life is ruined and I know it seems like something tiny but my head just doesn t feel like that and I ve been trying to force myself to snap out of it and act normally but it s when I have to focus on things I keep remembering that I m really sorry if this is weird or too much for this page thing I also collapsed in school or fainted or something which I don t know if something to do with this but I was just so tired so I asked to go to the toilet and collapsed in the hallway which a teacher seen and I just said I didn t get much sleep last night because I was playing games and they asked if I was sure and I said yes I m fine and just really warm because it was a warm day too Like idk if this is the right website for this but if you know somewhere else that s fine I m sorry,"Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Hi I m not feeling too hot I know it s common to feel depressed once in a while but today I m actually starting to scare myself I saw a reddit ad yesterday said something like help the DREAM act pass or something like that So i went to comments and all i see is just Hate The DREAM act is supposed to help illegal immigrants get a work visa or something Well that s pretty much how everything started If you haven t guessed by now I m illegal i guess I am an illegal human being Wow kinda feels good letting that out That s good i was hoping this venting would make me feel better Anyway I was brought here when i was years old i had no choice on the matter Now I m still in the same situation I don t have shit for rights can t get a driving license can t get into college because i don t have a ssn always trying to dodge the police but hey they make sure i get a number to file taxes every year so i can pay up because supposedly I make too much But that doesn t matter almost years of living this way kinda sucked My childhood and teenage years were stained by all of it I was always too scared to go to parties in case they got busted or something like that or just scared of going out in general Because of this i was never able to keep many friends i would always just blow them off because i was just scared of getting in trouble Till this day its just the way i am full of anxiety and self pity i guess Back to the ad maybe I m preaching to the wrong choir here It was just full of hate Uninformed people just talking about a subject they have no clue about We re labeled as criminals and selfish we re seeing as rats I don t want to be here either man But what do you want me to do Go back to my own country The country i have almost no memory of I am just as American as you are the only difference is that I m shit and wasn t as lucky to be born here I m miserable here I love this country i love its people but I m not allowed here I m not going to say everything else is perfect but i feel like this is the root of all my anxiety and depression Well there was another pretty big bump in my life I had met a beautiful girl we clicked right away after about two weeks we started dating i like to think that i was truly happy with her There was a problem she had drug issues that she was overcoming I had no idea how to deal with all that i didn t know how bad heroin withdrawals were i was just ignorant of the whole subject Time passed by and everything was good i felt like i loved her we always joked because when she came out to me about being former drug addict i told her that i was an illegal immigrant so we both stunned each other that day it felt great because finally somebody i trusted knew about my situation and she reacted positive to it I think that really strengthen our relationship Well long story short everything that is good dies She relapsed took too much i guess and overdosed leading to her death It s been two years and i still can t help to feel guilty A person on that state of mind shouldn t be dating a relationship can be stressful a recovering drug addict shouldn t be put under even more stress Damn i sure spilled my guts here Well i honestly don t have a motivation to live anymore I just don t feel like i have the strength to wake up in the morning if it wasn t for work i could sleep for like hours straight lol I know life is a precious thing and some people have it much worse but i just don t want to deal with it anymore i give up They say God never hands you more than you can handle so i can more than likely get through with this but i don t want too I m tired I originally wrote this because i was seriously considering driving off a bridge on my way back from work i don t think I will be doing that anymore So i guess this helped I m going to stop writing now because im tearing up and i can barely see my computer screen lol Sorry i made it so long i just wanted to vent Good luck to all you guys going through the same thoughts You probably shouldn t do it though And to the lurkers seriously type up your problems and send them venting makes you feel so much better maybe it just changes your mind Sorry about the grammar and shit Take care SW,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

I m too stupid to achieve anything in life I m thinking of taking my life tomorrow night I have a low IQ Twice I ve been tested and both times I got an IQ around Somehow I didn t do entirely awful in school I was able to be a B student without much studying When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the s and even some at Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades I barely retained any of what I learned Nobody around me believes that I am stupid because of my grades but that is all they go off of I have a poor vocabulary overall especially in spoken word and I cannot do basic mental math I still count with my fingers and I am nineteen years old I am from a low income uneducated family so I was innately disadvantaged from birth also with having my mom smoke weed and cigarettes throughout her pregnancy with me During the th month of her pregnancy I detached from the placenta and they had to preform an emergency c section It is very likely that I have brain damage from oxygen deprivation I just feel incredibly empty every moment I am awake My favorite time of the day is when I go to sleep at night but night always goes by too quickly Lately I ve been spending everyday sleeping because I have much more joy in my dreams I just want at least an average intelligence at least It is unbearable being aware every moment that I am dumb and will only ever be dumb I have always aspired to leave the financial hole but everyday that passes reminds me that it will probably never happen At this point I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place because I am terrified to leave behind my family and my pets but I know if I continue living my life will only get worse and worse Please if anyone could give me even just a smidgen of hope I will be greatly appreciative,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

I m falling apartI ve fucked up a lot in my lifetime I m years old and somehow I ve managed to go from daddy s little angel who went to catholic school and loved Disneyland to a pathetic whore burnout who cuts herself and can t go a day without having something go horribly wrong I ve worked really hard to go from the girl I was last year as depicted in the second description to someone who may have a shitty past but has some self respect and who has stopped cutting It s been almost months and for the first time since the nd month I m considering it Here s the story Freshman year and guy who s name I m going to leave out but for now we re going to call him Jake Jake invited me to his house for Halloween and when I got there he somehow convinced me to do some sexual acts I wasn t quite ready for I never said no but I felt as if it was necessary for me to do it in order for him to like me So I did and then he dumped me like I was trash A few weeks later he was bored with whatever poor girl he d convinced to fuck him and he came back to me told me he d changed he d found God and he was a new guy Nope He did it again this time taking even more than the last And again dumped me like I was trash I hated him but more than that I hated myself for falling for it twice I smoked weed to forget about it and I cut because it was better to feel a physical pain that I could control than an emotional pain in which Jake had all the control I stole liquor from my moms cabinet and stole money from her wallet for weed Then I dated another guy who we ll call Zach for our sakes Zack was a coke addict he d been to prison ran away from home stole thousands of dollars from stores beat up people and cars and windows and whatever for money I was lonely he was there He took my virginity And then my mom found out About everything She admitted me in the hospital and I ve been on medications and things ever since And finally this morning I looked in the mirror and thought you know what Jake is missing out I m beautiful and smart and funny And even if I don t always believe it not many people hesitate to remind me And I felt like I was walking on cloud until lunch that is Some random dumbass freshman asked me if I was prganant because he d heard I was a whore and it sort of looks like it I held my shit together and laughed it off Then Jake cussed me out because his new toy found out about what he did to me Apparently it s my fault he s an abusive mysogenistic ass I came home and told my mom my best friend my companion my everything about what a shitty day I d had She blew me off over and over again talked over me told me I was being annoying for the rest of the night Finally I decided to just sit in the corner until her friends left and when they did she and I laughed and sang songs and joked and all that Then I said something about having school tomorrow and it being in the morning and she started yelling at me saying I was irresponsible because of my low grades and how I have no right to blame her for my being up so late and how she always does everything for me and now she has to be my alarm clock too I just it kills me when she s mad and today of all days I can t handle it I just want my mom to give me a big hug and tell me it s okay and tell me I m beautiful and all that but the thing is she s called me a whore too She s said I m so fat I look pregnant She s cussed me out before And she blames me for everything that happened with Jake She hates me as much as I hate myself even if she loves me as her daughter And it s slowly tearing me apart,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Feels personal poetry from a broken heart He stripped away my self worth Layer by layer until even my bones held no trace of my personality I lost sight of the girl I used to be she was caged in my chest and he swallowed the key as I stood there and watched The problem was that I wanted to be loved so badly that I couldn t tell that it wasn t love You taught me love was you draining me of my identity injecting self doubt into my veins brainwashing me into thinking everything was my fault and that I was messed up You let me think love was questioning my own sanity walking around aimlessly Love to me was rubbing your heavy words off of my skin and making my mental state fall to the floor The taste of your love lingered in my heart and tore me apart I d tell myself I can fix him but he has been rusted for too long and can no longer be fixed Don t be the lamb he sacrifices drinking your blood like water Don t be the martyr to his self hate and loathing Don t save him by destroying yourself Don t let him say sorry over and over again like that same old song,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping",Medium

weeks ago on my th birthday i went to sleep with a plastic bag over my head after eating half a bottle of xanax because nothing makes any sense to me i am still unclear as to how i ended up in hospital and what went wrong all i know is my dad saved me When i was i use to have a reoccurring dream that went over my head at the time I would watch myself from a third person perspective sit in front of one of those old box TVs watching the tv static not being aware of anything else as i watched myself from an out of body perspective i would sometimes freak out and try to scream at myself and try to understand why i was unaware of anything outside of the TV static My last time having this dream i remember something stopping me from trying to snap myself out of this zombie state This was a calm feeling telling me that it is impossible for me to stop watching the static on the tv because i am apart of the tv i then got realizations that this whole life thing is just apart of some sort of box and there are things happening outside this box that our brains cannot come close to processing i remember waking up completely mind fucked and still to this day believe there is so much more going on in this thing than our brains can comprehend For years now it completely boggles me how people can live like sheep i really feel that people dont think for themselves how can people wake up every day knowing they are apart of some pointless scandle Humans turned this mysterious wonder into some sort of game to benefit people with money power Rich people get richer by paying poor people crumbs so they can work till they re just so they can put food on the table The poor person is told they should be grateful for there job even though they can and will be replaced with ease there are homeless kids halfway across the planet who are scratching their eyes out because they haven t ate in weeks people who run our world are born into money and as long as everyone is going with the flow things will be fine The worst part is it doesn t even matter we were given Goldilocks condition to paint our own picture so this corrupt world simply is what it is all i have known my whole life is that i would rather die than be alive in this shit,"Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

I m just gonna not make any sense here for a while I really don t know what s wrong with me I ve always been like this the tiniest argument or foul word will completely destroy me I never talk to anyone because I m terrified of rejection or disapproval But the strange thing is when I do talk people seem to like me My best friends would tell you or rather have told other people that I have no personality I simply act like whoever I m hanging out with and they re true I hang out with people because it makes me feel normal but most of them only talk to me because they think I m normal It usually takes about a month or so of knowing someone before they realize I m different than who I pretend to be and slowly cut off every tie we have So then there s alcohol Alcohol is what I turned to a few weeks before the only person in the entire world who understood me hung himself to death while masturbating So that s how my cousin died he was pretty much a big brother he always around the only other DUDE in our family Dead as shit naked with a god damn belt around his neck So then there was my girlfriend I started dating her a few weeks later and not until two years later did I find out she was an actual nut She was insane and would always scream at me and throw beer bottles and shit because she didn t think I loved her and for some dumbass reason I kept trying to convince her I did because for some dumbass reason I did love her and all the while feeding my alcoholism Then she ran off with my best friend feeding him the same lies about me she fed me about her ex boyfriend about how I beat her and hit her every night to the point she was actually describing things that she did as if I did them So I broke up with her terribly and moved back home where I am now facing a year of jail for getting a DUI that violated my probation for psychedelic mushrooms that weren t even mine And although real life for the past three years has seemed like mindless distractions from thinking about killing myself I ve only ever seriously considered it three times and every single time i regret not killing myself I always wait around hoping things will get better and all of a fucking sudden I just lose a handful of friends who probably never fucking liked me to begin with and I m going to jail or somebody s dead All I can think about is if my cousin just hadn t fucking killed himself I could because my family can t take another trauma I hate being like this but craziness runs in our family especially in the males I have a high IQ which I view as like having a quad core processor on a linux computer with MB ram designed to do nothing but word processing The only things I m good at are making music which will never make me any money and talking to people which is simply something I m completely good at fucking faking And on top of this I don t have any money we are literally fucking poor I make bucks an hour and my dad makes minimum wage the only reason we haven t lost our house is because my Grandma who leases it to us stopped charging so they could afford lawyers to cover up the fucking shame they feel like I ve shat all over their family I m twenty one Only twenty fucking one not even almost twenty two How much longer will it be before my fucking brains starts being normal again,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

I am scared i m scared shitless i thought about killing myself several times over the years but now something came up and if it s bad then I might just do it i do not know why i havent done it yet im tired of being a failure of disappointment to my family especially my mother Maybe it s the thought of her finding me dead and probably wondering what did she to do deserve this what did she do wrong she is the only family I have as my father works overseas and he didnt impact my life very much I see him just the one that sends us money so we do not starve if there was another person to do that I wouldn t really miss him My sister lives h away and I hate she said some terrible things to my mother after she went drinking because she wouldn t pay her some stupid debt we couldn t afford it and spread the rumor in our natal town rural town that my mother is a whore my mom knows it and she got over it she dares to look my sister in the eye and tell her i love you it s stupid my mother is everything to me but this world is just stupid to me im thinking about the peace that may come one i close my eyes black silence no more pain no more anything I ll let this life behind but that s scary and I m a guy that gets scared easily I may die quick or slow or with huge pain or no pain at all but that s impossible to know right,"Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Thoughts I m a male I m and I ve done drugs in the past hours Now I sit back down at my computer at my parents house and start on my second beer I was a hopeful lad great at baseball and a seeming knack for just getting it I counted the girls that liked me on my fingers while taking a poop That was like rd grade I had orthodontics for years and even though I didn t decide for myself that I wanted to do the treatment or perform the treatment I feel the blame for the negative results and think the whole thing genuinely fucked up my life I feel the blame for the process because to some degree or another I do feel that we are responsible for our cards Call it Karma I still want to blame others I should have had better follow up and guidance during the orthodontic process After all I started when I was What went wrong was that I was a boy I didn t like to take showers and I didn t like to wear fucking headgear or retainers at night so I didn t and being young what could go wrong Mistake My transition to my freshman year of college was greeted by a lovely surprise Because of my orthodontics and sparse retainer use the way my teeth came together shifted and started wreaking havoc with how I hold my jaw My jaw started jutting forward producing an underbite which was new to me Picture this Here I am freshman year of college supposedly the most socially engaging and fun years of my life and I have a lower jaw that s growing like Pinocchio I totally freaked and even though I made attempts at being social it never came naturally and increasing jaw tension and attention on the jaw only made matters worse At this point I started becoming increasingly reclusive All social situations were an uphill battle and subconsciously I couldn t wait to get out of them I know as a culture we re socially stunted my big thing is that I m special because I really had it bad with this I started to recognize that every conversation I started to have turned into me introspectively judging how my jaw looks to that person This feedback loop of increasing attention to that region and genuine orthodontic fuck up only increased my jaw tension I turned to Buddhism and meditation After finishing college I started living at Buddhist monasteries There wasn t much responsibility and there wasn t much social interaction but enough to suffice to the idea of being part of something and moving forward I did this for a few years and became quite a skilled meditator because I was disciplined and motivated enough to only escape to meditation not to videogames and other stuff porn Because I grew up in an upper middle class family the blueprint of being successful is as good as hardwired into me I needed to prove to my family and friends that I could make it and I needed to be good at meditation because it was is the only thing I have faith that has genuinely produced earnest positivity in human beings Well this push pull of western and eastern ideology in your mid twenties is probably going to be a shit show and I haven t proved any different I went as far as becoming a monk for a year and have lived in monasteries for years out of the since I have graduated The other time I spent hiking the Appalachian Trail and moving to DC failing pretty badly at getting off the ground in job or social aspects Now I m and feel like I m being spoon fed a hot coal of bitter medicine Jaw problems aren t just jaw problems Our teeth and bite have a whole shit load to do with how the neck and spine co operate with eachother When things are out of whack with your bite it can throw the entire spinal chain off in ways we don t really understand yet The body is an unbelievably complex and connected machine This has only increased my jaw tension and I had an X ray done for confirmed scoliosis in my back I m and the bitter medicine is that barring a miracle I m not turning this physical decline around That s the gut punch Ever since I ve always thought that I d get through this and be able to communicate and socialize and get pretty girls and do all the things that I was promised That s never going to happen and in all likelihood my body is only going to turn more and more into a prison I don t have any trade skills I don t socialize It just seems bleak when I put it down and lay the facts out I ve been home at my parents for over a month now and my habits are vaporizing I m lost I m paranoid I m unwilling to try new things I can t go forward I can t go backwards and I can t stand still amp x B amp x B,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Closer than I ve ever been before I am a monumental fuck up From age until I was a drug addict I pushed any friend that tried to help me or wanted to keep me grounded in reality away and embraced the ones who facilitated me getting high Also during this period of time from about I found myself taking care of my ailing mother and complete ignoring myself other than to get my fix of course COPD and lung cancer ravaged her for a long time and I would sit high as a kite and do whatever I could for her because there was no one else to help In my mind I thought when her suffering ends maybe mine will too And I really believed this to some degree When she finally passed I remained addicted depressed even more so as one of my best friends died during this time and isolated for about one more year maybe a year and a half Then I got extremely sick and was so miserable that I just decided to give everything up while I was sick And it somehow it worked for me I ve been clean and sober from opiates opiate substitutes cocaine crack cigarettes marijuana and anything else that I found myself abusing for five years now in December Which is good and all but now I do not know what to do with myself and a hopeless feeling like one I ve never felt before is slowly crushing me I haven t been officially employed for more than a decade I did not go to college I want to go but I have no idea where to start and have no one to talk about this with and feel like even if I did I would just breakdown I look at my peers and everyone is happy with a family and a career and then here I am with nothing to show but the damage I ve done to my body with my horrible decisions I truly feel like maybe it would be best if I just disappeared Just went out one night to some remote area and blew my brains out I ve had this thought before but as I keep wasting time I just feel like it s a reasonable solution,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

i feel truly hollow and aloneheya to those reading ive been here a few times awhile back in the past but i feel this time is different i should probably explain myself a bit in case people want to understand where im coming from My name is Macy im a transgender girl and recently ive kinda fell into a fucked up place and i dont think i can get through this one awhile back i ended up leaving my highschool because of my social anxiety bullying lack of motivation and some other things to appease my parents i got enrolled in a few online classes because i still legally need to be in a school at the age of fifteen but its basically dropped out at this point in my life ive been able to keep my social life alive since that happens awhile back but as with how the world works to a regular teenager friends change but this time with my old friends now gone i really have no one anymore but a few people online and my bed and the online friends arent really close to me either ive had some issues in the past with drugs coke acid weed cigs some others that i had under control for the most part but recently ive felt the urge that it might be my only way to cope with this pain i feel in me thats driving my sanity to the breaking point i understand im young and i probably dont know what im talking about at this point in my life but i know what i feel and it feels really terrible my now ex boyfriend hasnt spoken to me in over two weeks which has really strained my mentality because he was all i had left in terms of close people and i struggle with signs of some mental illnesses that make me really dependent and clingy i m not a fan of self diagnosing and my therapist said i can show signs but cant really have a disorder or etc until you re an adult but he said he would agree i show signs of the things i believe i might have ive found myself in a state of constant distraction to keep me from thinking of how alone and in pain i am but it only eats at me more i really dont know what to do anymore ive tried hotlines in the past but they didnt help and i keep getting the urge to die or do something drastic to make myself happy and then die in peace knowing i did what i wanted im sorry about the bad grammar im not really in the best of moods to proofread my rant about my depression,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Advice on getting drunk for the first time This may sound a bit vanilla or jokey or whatever but I got properly hammered for the first time ever last night at Overall the experience was enjoyable but I thought I d share some tips from the experience as underage drinking is very common these days Definitely do it in the company of adults and in a safe place Amongst friends in a field is a very very bad idea Make sure the majority of people there have experience being drunk so they know recovery mechanisms or how to deal with you should something go wrong Make sure you have multiple options for sleep so that should you not be able to return home there are other options be it a friend s house or whatever That s the major points out of the way if I think of anything else during my current recovery I ll update this later,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium

My friend is slowly getting worse and has made threats to kill himself I m not sure what steps to take Hi everyone Best wishes to everyone and I m so sorry that anyone has to go through what you all have gone through I myself have thankfully been able to get out of my own depression and am now in a better place My friend however just seems to be getting worse He s only Just turned a few months ago actually Lately he s been making threats I wouldn t call them threats but the word that I m looking for escapes me and saying things like if my dad s gun case wasn t locked I don t know what I would do and things of that nature very very openly to me He said once that he might do it soon if things don t get better I ask him why and he says I just can t deal with it anymore He s been very reckless lately When he was younger at around or so he got his hands on some strong prescription pain killers and benzodiazepines which he stole from family and his parents Ever since then he s loved the idea of getting more He hasn t tried any pharmaceutical opiates in years but I guess for some people the feeling just can t ever be forgotten Then he found out about Kratom Kratom is great and for responsible users it s a godsend I use it myself every once in a while and it s fantastic Great for pain and sleep Ever since he got some he s started abusing it It started out as something he did every once in a while but within a week he had said f it and started using it every time something went wrong in his life He uses it as a crutch if you will One day I passively mentioned phenibut and then he suddenly ordered some I deeply regret that He abuses this now too Phenibut is a nootropic that has anti anxiety characteristics It s notorious for its rebound anxiety and withdrawal after being abused I honestly don t know how much he s used of Phenibut but he s had some pretty bad anxiety now that he says he s off of it Now he has been talking about getting some strong pharmaceutical opiates again I tried to tell him that that road might not lead him to happiness and that he could prossibly be worse in the long run but he just retorted with isn t the goal of life to have as much fun as possible and be as happy as possible I tried to reason with him and say no the goal is the be fully happy with the situation you re in without the use of substances I may have been wrong it s fine to seek help from substances But he hasn t seen a psychiatrist or anything so at this point he s self medicating and poorly at that He s always struggled with depersonalization derealization as well And he says it s been getting worse In my opinion I think the substances he s been testing with may be making him worse in the long run He doesn t seem to want help though There s other stuff that I won t list here one of which I think could possibly be messing up his brain s dopamine system but he doesn t even want to try stopping it I mean if it could help and you re pretty desparate why not But I m not him and he s probably in a completely different headspace than I m in Also he has a LOT of anxiety stemming from the fact that he ll need to be going to college soon and honestly I feel like he s still very much a kid inside His parents gave him the option of waiting one year but he saw his other friend just decide not to go to college after getting a well paying job during his gap year Reading through this post I m pretty sure that I m not looking at all of this from the right perspective It s been a long time since I was in a situation similar to his so I m having trouble putting the shoes on the other foot so I apologize,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Killing myself after I post thisHey everyone I made a throwaway so if I do survive I don t have to live with the shame of seeing this in my post history I had no one to say goodbye to so I m saying goodbye to a bunch of strangers Like a weirdo I m and I know people might think I still have time to turn my life around I ve heard it all by now Therapy pills friends psych wards whatever the fuck you name I ve tried it It s all bullshit Life is bullshit I have been abused at home since I was years old by an alcoholic mother who is now using my little brother as a second chance at raising someone who isn t a worthless eyesore I can t bear to look at her putting all her hope of raising someone who s not gonna waste away in a filthy room for weeks while not speaking and staring at a wall into such a young child People think it s jealousy it s not I know she s going to crush all his hopes and dreams when he grows up and I can t bear to wait to see it happen like it did to me I used to have dreams once I wanted to be an artist Cliche as fuck but it was my dream and I was set on it Everyone hadn t my back except for the one person who I needed the most She pushed me aside for cocaine and vodka She burned all my art when I was and beat me until I said I wanted to be a lawyer or doctor forgot which one I had broken ribs and she had dislocated most of my right half in the process of throwing me around like a rag doll I still have issues with joints dislocating to this day My nose broke and she almost blinded me with glass from a bottle so yeah that dream was crushed At age I was made to cook and clean for myself She didn t lift a finger to help me while I scalded my whole lower half with a pot of boiling water instead laughing at me and blaming me in the ER after the neighbors called the police due to my screaming and crying I still have scars from that which I get bullied for I never had a single friend in school I was the quiet poor kid who always smelled weird and cried all day At age I fell in with the wrong crowd and I m still addicted to cigarettes which is tame compared to other shit I did back then I was raped by people in the space of an hour and since then I have not had a period no I m not pregnant I gave up on school and I just sit there blankly all day or just don t show up for which my mother beats me and even my therapist gave up on me and cancels every appointment we have last minute Now I m sitting on my bed after taking around bottles of sleeping pills I stocked up yay waiting for them to kick in and typing this No one is going to miss me Not a single person I didn t leave a note There s no point since my mother will throw it away when she finds me Hopefully hell doesn t exist since I m definitely gonna end up there if it does I had a good run Thanks for reading everyone,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
I desperately need help Hello I m a years old male college student I don t know where to begin I ll spare you my family problems I got over them I don t even know how to properly describe my situation I have no girlfriend nor I had many in the past I had two relationships that lasted less than a week when I was and the last one ended badly Six months ago I found out that my girlfriend of five months was cheating on me with two guys at the same time throught the whole period she spent with me She told me she felt pity for me and didn t want to dump me but she didn t really like me I fell as down as I ve ever fallen before as soon as she said that to me Even though I m socially akward I am also a good liar and I managed to make everyone believe I was fine confident and manly I didn t want my friends to feel bad for me so I dealt with my feelings when I was alone and faked confidence when I was with them My male friends constantly ask me for advices on how to be more like me because they think that I don t talk a lot because I m mysterious and other utter bullcrap like that They make me look cooler than I really am The reality is that I m a messed up guy who can t even talk without doing something cringyin and says that girls are not his priority to look cool just so that people don t wonder why he doesn t have one I cry myself to sleep everynight I usually sleep one to two hours everynight because of all the shit that goes on in my head Drinking wine has helped me with the thoughts and the insomnia but I ve recently stopped because I m scared of going down the alcoholic route which would make me feel even more pathetic These six months have been the darkest of my life so far All of my male friends have a girlfriend talk to me about how happy they are and I have to pretend I m happy for them In reality I just wish they all lost whatever they have out of jelousy I ve dumped all of my female friends because I m slowly becoming obsessed with not being friendzoned by girls Whenever an attractive friend of mine came up to me for advice I instantly felt like shit because she is treating me like a female friend Even newly met girls do that They don t even find me interesting enough to even consider dating me and straight up see me as an emotional dumpster The worst thing is that I actually try not to make myself view like that by avoiding giving advices and being the classic nice guy I am so not interesting that they fucking put me in the friendzone The last drop was today I ve been chatting with this girl for a couple of days she seemed interested since she always initiated contact touched me asked me very personal questions and in general her body language was telling me that she was interested I followed my usual line of thoughts by faking confidence and pretending my life was all good and interesting also because I have no interest in boring a stranger to death with my personal problems Today she hugged me and told me she loves me like a fucking brother I ve managed to put myself in the friendzone in not even a fucking week I don t know I just don t know She is now texting me and I don t want to answer her because I know she wants a friendship out of me and I do not want to give her that My pride is no more I don t want to talk about it with my friends because the way they see me is probably the only one good thing about my life I m also supposed to go to a party tonight and she is going to be there I think I ll stay home I don t know,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Think I have finally mentally snappedThis week has strangely been the one to push me over I finally got a chance to hear from my biological family Don t expect anyone to understand how it felt to see and hear them for the first time in a year When I left they had no idea of the real reasons My mother tainted them all with vile lies about me This week they all head and saw the truth but I m not sure if they can realise the whole truth Been in quarantine since early March before the official lock down It has destroyed and torn my mental health apart Every inch of progress I made has gone The darkness has won and consumed me by now I can t keep wearing a mask It s full of cracks holes and crumbling away Even a simple disagreement lead to a massive break down for me Ended in tears I couldn t control nor feel I want to honestly say fuck this Give me a gun so I can end myself Give me anything to end this I don t want to fight anymore I m done with this bullshit of a life All I m doing is ruining everyone else s lives I don t want to drink eat or sleep it s a waste of time and resources I can t see myself living till the end of the year It s shit how whenever I feel anything I mindlessly cry I want this hell to end,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Don t know if it s all worth itSorry this is a drunken rant I ve been lonely forever and I ve been empty for what feels like forever The longer I go the more friends I lose and the smaller the prospect of me having a good future seems to get I ve suffered from complications with anxiety and depression for most my life and it has cost me a lot I wont be able to finish my degree and will likely be taking another year or two to finish it while the few friends that I do have move out of state and forget about me The anxiety I feel with finishing school and figuring out how the hell I m going to pay for it builds everyday I can hardly sleep anymore and it s making my school life even worse I seem to only be able to get an hour or twos worth at a time before I m awoken by nightmares or anxiety and then I just feel shittier This whole last week has felt like one big day to me with me sleeping for a random hour here and there and there being no day night cycle to bide my time by I ve begun drinking more than I would care for and that has me worried as well as I already have enough problems but I hardly feel ok without it Last weekend I had a drunken breakdown at my friends house during a small get together I can t even fucking remember the beginning or the end of it all I can remember is being on the floor and begging for forgiveness for ruining the night and crying about stupid shit involving some poor decisions I made in bad situations in the past Out of the people there one had been aware of my shit in the past and I never really talked about this kind of stuff with the other one I didn t mean to have a breakdown and I can t even remember how it started as I was drunk but at the same time I don t really want to know what all I said My friends were supportive but whats the fucking point when all the friends that I have lost have been too Despite their response I feel like I am just one step closer to losing them all I am so sick and tired of everything just hurting I wish I could see the world through the eyes of people that seem to enjoy it I don t know were to go or what to do or what comes next and it feels like a vise is around my heart I know that I have already lost I m only alive because of a fluke and the fact that I objectively know that I am weak of spirit will never go away How can someone like me claim living is worth it while knowing that I failed and that none of this will really change It feels like the future is set in stone and I am hopeless to change it,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Advice from a manic depressive As a Bipolar person in curciles My Brother also He goes up when he spirals I go way way way way down I feel guilt and manic depression Luckily I have a strong willpower and tricky myself into believing which is why the post a strong moral compass So what I ve learned is basically if you really not only want attention but truly just want to give up because you don t see the shamrock on the horizon your body just starts to shut down Any form of manic depression leads to a shut down of who we are I get hives on my hands from stress or whatever and my organs when I try to feel em are just giving up SO take it or leave it but The thing to do here is do all the stupid shit they told you Go out in nature and feel your poorly evolved nature fucked up okay it s not your fault and try to get some sense of how your emotions and depression is leading to a shut down Grab a stick pull it apart do some insane summer salts to get well Floss even tho everyone as miserable as me just wants a bottle of whiskey and a kind person to take their hand and place an opium pipe Feel your body giving up If you don t understand then you just need to tell your momma you love her and ask her to make er a sandwich If your truly manicly depressed like me then just give deep breathing a try It sounds like hopeful counselor office posters of advice stollen all the way from china and reformated but it s actually what you gotta do if it s the gears of capitalist society that s crushing you get some SSI checks They re present for a reason You may be looking at a sharp metal today and wish nothing but tomorrow you may be laughing We re superior to the sport s fans who deny themselves thought Hang in there,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

I feel like I ve lost my mindMan life sucks This will be a long summary of what led me to my caption above I F am so tired of living Every single day that I wake up feels like a struggle so I just stopped waking up I sleep all day I sleep until it s the middle of the night and then I wake up because I can t sleep anymore I hate my life In summary I was born as a refugee and brought here as a severely malnourished child with many health related issues that I overcame Due to the fact of assimilating to America as a small baby with a mom who barely could speak English and older siblings with severe PTSD we had an extremely rough upbringing We were starving and hungry most of our days We landed in New York and were brought to Boston The income disparity between me and my peers were staggering My older siblings got jobs to support us and my mom fell into a deep depression that debilitated her and in turn made her completely bed ridden I wouldn t consider my mom abusive but after going to therapy I found that I was severely neglected as a child My mom had really bad PTSD and horrific depression Most days she stayed in bed as I watched her body deteriorate She was prone to many illnesses due to her major depressive state My mom had also been brutally sexually assaulted and raped trying to emigrate all of us Due to this fact she always assumed that I couldn t be around anyone of the opposite sex including my own brothers uncles cousins and most especially others My mom would do daily checkups and check my genitalia anytime I would leave the house and come back home just to see if my hymen was intact still I was such an anxious kid because of this I would always jump when she would come around Yet on the flip side I was attached to my mom at the hip in a very unhealthy way My dad came to America for two short years and could ve done so much for us He was an engineer Yet he was a scumbag and decided to leave my mom because of his toxic habits and laziness He went back to the homeland so he could have maids and cooks and marry a young year old woman who would bear more kids for him Anyway I was the youngest out of I was advanced in school I did EVERYTHING I needed to do to escape poverty and to escape the environment I was being raised in I told myself that this life wouldn t last long I told myself that one day I would be able to take care of all of us included the rest of my extended family who couldn t escape the war torn country we emigrated from My mom moved us to a different state when I was about years old so we could be closer to people who were from our ethnicity since Boston had very little refugees from my country This was the biggest mistake We went from a city that had ample opportunities to a place with little to none We were subjected to even worse poverty and hunger and terrible living conditions Boston was more of an advanced city they had programs for people like us and educational opportunities that kept my mind working and my stomach full I spent most of my days daydreaming I would write a lot and read anything I could get my hands on shampoo bottles textbooks anything to keep me from my mind Most of my younger years were spent in my bedroom I wasn t allowed to hang out with friends go to the movies you can say I was extremely sheltered I wasn t allowed to leave the home unless it was for school or a doctor Me and the rest of my siblings always assumed it was because my mom was protecting us but as an adult I found out that it was because she had agoraphobia and severe anxiety She wanted us around because she would have panic attacks if she was ever left alone Up until this day shes never spent one day by herself At the age of I skipped my th grade year and tested out straight to high school I was in my freshman year of high school albeit being socially stunted compared to my classmates I was cognitively equal I spent three years in high school and skipped my th grade year I was when I graduated high school I got accepted to a plethora of colleges including Harvard It was my dream come true I was finally going to be back in the same city I used to live in Cambridge Ma My mom wouldn t allow it She said no to everything because I was too young She instead had me enrolled into a local community college My dreams were shattered Everything I had ever worked for was gone At I received my associates and finished my degree at the community college It was at this point when my mom had to leave the country to visit family This was the first time in my life I spent a single day without her During the time she was away I decided to be a teenager for the first time in my life I hung out with my friends attended parties and smoked my first joint By this point most of my older siblings moved out and began lives of their own There were only two of us left in the home me y o and my sister who was y o It was one of my older sisters who took the task to watch over us while my mom was away I met the love of my life while my mom was gone He was much older than me but we aligned in every single way He was I was I ve spent everyday with him minus a few up until now I felt like life was finally going to be great A year later I got accepted to the local university to finish my bachelors and found out I was expecting a child I had several good years and went on to finish my bachelors and land a job at the worlds leading tech companies The depression finally went away This is when we were given the horrible news We found out that my husband was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease and was in end stage kidney failure He required dialysis x a week to survive He lost his ability to walk My heart was broken The depression returned My life turned upside down again years of panic and anxiety and finally he received a kidney transplant It s been months since he received a new kidney and he has a few more surgeries left to help him walk again but I can t feel anything anymore I m numb I should be happy but I feel nothing at all I turned to alcohol because everything became too much I became an alcoholic I drink every day I drink my days away I think about how there s darkness looming around every corner I don t take my medication because I ve been down that road and I feel like it won t stop life from causing me to suffer I ve done therapy group therapy inpatient and outpatient treatments I feel like this shit is never going to end I just want to make it end Life is miserable and I really feel like I lost my mind TLDR I had a shitty upbringing and as soon as I thought I escaped my adulthood was even worse I ve lost hope,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of

Makes me sadder than I already Im so numb right now I wouldnt care if I suddenly just died for all of eternity unaware of anything but nothingness itselfI do drugs like magic mushrooms and marijuana to feel any kind of happiness When on neither on these I am a hollow shell of a human Empty numb and tired of everything Including eating and breathing So much effort so much tedious activities just to stay alive for another day week etc When really I know deep down inside that I will just die some day without an afterlife or reincarnation of any kind to redeem or console me Just utter oblivion Devoid of all my senses memories and even consciousness It doesn t help that when I feel good I feel really dramatically good At ease Comfortable and oh so alive just to plummet back into despair and depression I am quite sick of this sickening cycle Maybe there s something to this sick game charade of life and constant effort Something that hasn t clicked yet And that s my main reason for not offing myself I want to figure out this mess To find a reason to stay alive Sure it s got to be more than just drugs and dreams,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping",Medium

To the one quietly contemplating what he would miss I was like you once I had no vision of any overseable future I was blind to life and what it presented me with I was depressed and apathic nihilisticly searching for a way out I went through the motions every day I forced myself out of bed in the morning Usually i overslept with a few hours but luckily very few people could step into my shoes at work so it was tolerated I went to work and collapsed on the bed when i got home I saw no point in the totality of my neverchanging excistence and i wanted to die I wanted cancer i wanted it to end And at the strangest times your wish is often granted A day at the doctor reveiled an abnormality in a lymphenode I was admitted to the cancer treatment hospital for an operation and released a few days later Nothing to write home about really but my belief in a pointless existence had been rocked as i started to realize id be dead at the age of if this was a hundred maybe even years ago Contemplating these things i started with time to realize id actually miss the small things in life if i died I would never have felt the sun on my face again the wind pulling at my clothes The snowstorms chilling my bones and stabbing my cheeks I would never again have eaten a pancake with shugar Never smelt the clean air after a thunderstorm Id never again see a lovely girl walking in a bikini at the beach Never again hear the birds chitter over the mountain stream quietly dancing through the meadows And so these thoughts started to condense and i came to the conclusion that the things i would miss were not specific to say the pancake I would miss the very basic action The seeing hearing feeling tasting and smelling I would miss my senses And thus i knew why i was alive I knew the essence of my existence With this epiphany a new kind of sense came into being a combination of them all It can be described as nothing else than The experience I could suddenly stop when it came over me and just be Just feel the experience of receiving input through the senses It was exhilarating Sitting on a bench in a town square Riding a roller coaster walking in the woods All the things that would challenge my senses and push them further than before And my wish for death slowly started to melt away But wishes granted are often granted with a two barreled shotgun to use a different cliche than the double edged sword one The cancer of course was back and got a real grip this time I was granted my wish and i could never take it back I was admitted again the same day it was discovered and scheduled for a hour open surgery the next day After not eating for a day and drinking lots of foul tasting bowel emptying juices the surgeon came to see me to explain what he was going to do They were going to go inn through my stomach muscles up under the rib cage and remove of the worst affected lymphnodes in my thorax I was given a pill to daze me for insertion of some kind of coma inducing dripper into my spine I believe coma is preferred during these operations over drugs that shut down your nerves I dont even remember counting backwards before the void claimed me for the first time And then my world exploded I was wide open from my pelvis to my ribcage I was mangled and the pain was like a perfect storm The one that lifts you off your feet and slams you into the wall The one that rips trees from the ground and grinds your very soul to cinders I was dying and it couldnt come fast enough Two hands appeared at my side They were female and very pretty The nails were cut short and had no nailpolish They were covered in a brownish residue The skin was smooth but the folds around the joints were prominient It was the hands of a year old woman It never occurred to me to look up All that existed through the storm where those hands and the needle they were injecting into a plastic tube hanging next to my head And so i vanished into the darkness and hoped i would not remember this where i was going next I was floating in nothing and there was something familiar with the interruptions in my existence Sounds it had been called Voices dawned on me and i knew that was it Far away voices were talking A male and a female It was crude and gutteral Ugly cracks in silence I shut them out and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence There is something strangling me I realized waking up I wanted to tell the voices but i couldnt speak I wanted to wave to get their attention but i couldnt move I had no influence on this world I was a rock drowning in a river I was alone A constant high pitched tone started up in the distance The current swept me away and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence This one will be better i thought and decided try life again Are you ok Someone asked me I was in the recovery ward and the storm had abated I still couldnt move but i was able to open my eyes This is progress i remember thinking I am luckier than the last time i lived After recovering from the operation i was placed on a chemo therapy that lasted for months At the start i thought nothing much of it but i soon deteriorated into a quivering shadow of what i once was I was hooked up to the rat poison every weekday but the Thursdays were the worst Two nurses and a doctor usually came visiting with a bag wrapped in aluminium foil carried on a tray They were all wearing gloves and masks Thursdays i wanted to live more than any other day of the week I used to love the nights back then I do to this day actually They were free of the poison and it was bliss All the tubes and wires were disconnected and i felt like pinochio turning into a real boy If i was drugged enough i could almost remember being alive I could almost remember that i once could walk for a mile That i could laugh and run jump and climb a tree Almost alive somewhere There was a room on the ninth floor with some couches chairs and a tv where four patients used to sit and not talk The tv was never on They would stare at me and nod when i entered but never say anything I dont think they even knew each others names But they seemed as close as any friends could ever get I enjoyed their company even though they were years older than me Age didnt seem to matter we were all here and there was nothing to say I started to frequent this room more and more as time passed Everywhere else there were people wanting to talk or look encourage or pity It was disgusting and I hated them all About weeks had passed and a blessed night came again I quietly walked through the corridors until a man came up to me It was the first male nurse i had seen since i was admitted I hadnt thought of it before but this work place was really dominated by women He had made me cereal with milk one of the few things i could swallow without puking back up There is plenty of shugar he said smiling as he handed me the bowl Not waiting for a thank you he turned and left He d seen the night walkers before and knew what was coming The bowl was heavy and i knew i couldnt carry it far so i headed for the stairs leading up to the th floor At the first step i knew i wouldnt be able to climb them this night I had always liked sitting in stairs for some reason and found a sort of poetic beauty in having this meal here The stone was cold and i sat down with the bowl in my lap I had to spent a few moments getting my breath back Being able to bend down to sit is something you might not cherish But once you loose it you realize its immense value Dark empty halls seemed to stretch for an eternity Nothing outside mattered or was even real anymore These halls were the world i knew now the foundation of my existence I started eating my cereals letting go of one piece of my past for each bite Grinding the memories as i chewed Chomp i was climbing in a tree I could see to the end of the world i could climb into the sky Chomp i was on a swing with Eve We were weightless we were flying She was laughing and i shared in her laughter Chomp i was riding a bike I was going faster than i had ever thought possible No runner could ever catch up with me Chomp I was walking to school I was curious of what would come Excited of what we would learn Chomp I was landing my first heelflip on a skateboard I was proud i was admired by others i was accepted Chomp I was riding a moped I could go wherever i wanted i was free Chomp I was running through the woods with an ag automatic rifle I was in a brotherhood I was defending a nation Chomp I was at a party talking to Kristin I was in love Tears started streaming down my face as she vanished but there was no going back and i continued eating Chomp I was on extacy at a rave The beats vibrated through the air that surrounded me I was a spiral galaxy i was dancing flame Chomp I was being told i had cancer I was speechless Chomp i was walking into a small room of people with strange eyes on the ninth floor I was missing something important Chomp I was handed a bowl of cereals from a smiling man I was grateful Chomp i was siting down on stone steps I was sitting Chomp i was eating cereal I was eating Chomp i am chewing I am the sum of my experiences and memories I am old My whole life had vanished as i finished my last meal A calm feeling of being whole came over me and i was ready I sat the bowl down closed my eyes and then i died You cant sleep here the male nurse told me Your immune system is nonexistent and these steps are cold Lets get you back to bed And that is how my next existence started I was hollow for a long time after that It was like sensing through a veil Like listening to voices from under water Everything was far away and i was looking at reality from outside Time passed and i went again to the room on the ninth floor There were three now They nodded as i entered but seemed to look at me differently recognizing something And suddenly i saw what they had always said as it echoed in my mind We who are about to die salute you And they were right We were gladiators we were fighters and we had all been sentenced to die But each moment we had was a treasure more precious than any earthly riches We had nothing we could loose nothing we could want nothing that could ever be taken away from us Our life our thoughts our actions and opinions were no ones but our own By letting go of everything we had gained something new A new beginning where each experience is a separate existence Like an eternal supply of white paper and colored pencils We had gained life And so i write this post not only to free myself from previous battles and to wake again to a new existence But to tell you that in your next existence you will one day wake up and realize it is all better that today is a good day I promise,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
This may be itSo my friend decided I should come over to drink with her I said yes Unfortunately this is what she said One condition no sadness I m trying to chill tonight I don t mean to be insensitive It s just that you talking makes me want to talk amp I don t talk to people That s why I always drink So yeah if you don t mind Like man Just say you don t want to listen to me vent anymore Just say I am a waste of your good vibes You of all people should know I ve been dealing with shit since I was young Hence why you re the few people I found comfort in Now I can t find it in anyone else I can t I fucking can t My other friend said what I was doing is childish and that I was seeking attention My own fucking friends The only two that I ve had now I have no one And don t tell me to find someone to anchor because I lost them All because of me Because of me I ve made a slit going down the road but I didn t go deep enough Well time to make some changes First the man I loved ghosted me then now my own friend practically doesn t want me around her with my negativity Fuck At this point I have nothing to lose because all is lost all is fucking lost I know for a fact that there ll be people missing me but I also know for a fact there ll be tons who d forget my name and who I was well I guess this is goodbye,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium
It seems overly dramatic but this is what I feel I hate my entire being And no these feelings are not a result of me being on my period This just happened and I don t know if I should be concerned or attempt to have a moment like this again I wrote this in a Word document as I was failing to make any progress on an assignment in it I recount something which happened to me this Monday Posted on r SuicideWatch because I want with my entire being to be removed from this life and I might just get the strength to do it myself But I fear if I try I will fail as I do with everything else I lay on my bed in pain sitting in my own mess when I would typically change my pad and take some ibuprofen drink some tea But I did not I laid idle making no attempt to soothe the pain which plagued me I told myself this is all I deserve I accepted defeat Said all the things which I hate about myself Scolded myself for trying for thinking I have or even deserve a chance at happiness And when I finally got those thoughts through to myself when I finally accepted my agony rather than fight against it I fell asleep It was perhaps the most comforted I have ever felt The most complete knowing there is nothing else to be done that I may as well die laying there And I thought of it Dying of suffocation in my sleep didn t sound too bad But as all good things are in my life the relief was temporary Because here I am again trying Just barely but trying And it hurts Because I m lost and I know there s no point but I still try I wish to accept defeat again To lie in the pain I deserve And to fall asleep comforted by the peace of being done Permanently,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

i m all out of hopesorry if this doesn t make much sense i m sort of in the middle of a breakdown and i don t know what i m going to do i m depressed like really depressed it comes and goes but it s been a steady downward path before i got depressed i was a promising student at a world famous university now i m no longer in school unemployed keep getting rejected living with roommates at least one of whom hates me i am running out of money and relying on my parents even though i m an adult and i dont have a whole lot of food in my apt right now but i can t bring myself to do all the work of showering putting on clean clothes bundling up and walking to the store shopping carrying it all home putting everything away cooking something and then cleaning up directly afterwards or else my roommate will get mad at me i dont have the money to keep ordering out it s also very cold in my apt and i think that s really starting to drive me crazy i m also struggling with my gender and sexuality and i really really hate it i hate being queer that s not the only reason i m depressed but its constantly getting worse and its just one more thing i don t need to be dealing with right now i m trying i ve been trying i m now on ssri and at this point the only noticable effect is a shitton of memory loss i go to therapy i ve quit drinking i m even on meds for hypothyroid and i had some hope they might help my mood as well but right now looking back it seems things are only steadily getting worse the bottom line SW is that i cannot live the rest of my life like this every day i lose hope that it s going to go away because it seems to me like i m doing everything i can when things first got bad it was somewhat easy for me to tell myself it wasnt going to last forever but it s been years guys years and it s only gotten worse and i m no longer seeing the point i lived the best years of my life up to about age and since then i might as well be dead i wanted to be this amazing fucking scientist but now that doesn t even seem worth it even if i do somehow crawl out of this pit and become successful i don t even care if i still have to feel like this i thought maybe there was something wrong with me and all my doctors would figure it out eventually but now i m starting to think maybe i just cant handle being an adult and i m doomed to either live like this for the rest of my life or take the chance that there s something better on the other side i dont know i m scared i dont want to die but i m getting to the point where i refuse to live this way much longer i can t do it and i wont can someone just give me some hope that the rest of my life isnt going to be this way it s been so long and i m out of hope do you all have any you could spare,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress",Medium

I m doneI can t take it anymore I feel so isolated I m currently attending a top tier college People say I have the body of a supermodel and the hair of a supermodel However my face makes people want to throw up It sounds silly but it s so painful because I am reminded how awful my face is everywhere I go People wince whenever I turn around Women who I m out with are constantly getting hit on while I am being shunned avoided and straight up ignored as the ugly friend Men will come to us and ask for all their names and conveniently skip me Men will always try to leave me out of the conversation Most people don t want to be my friend I run triathlons which run over miles so I m physically very fit and most people think I m really funny and cool but with men I can t even get my foot into the door because of my awful face My efforts aren t worth anything to anyone One time when I went to a party a guy touched my shoulder and I turned around and he gagged Another time I was walking down the street and all the women walking in front of me were getting catcalled by a bunch of creeps and when I walked past they just called me nasty I ve never gotten catcalled in my life I still struggle to understand how women are so insulted by strangers calling them beautiful because I would die for such compliments Most people complain of their friends pressuring them to go out to bars to often Nobody ever pressures me to go out and even females always decline my requests to go out for fun I just go out to restaurants by myself go to bars by myself get myself drunk and then play beer pong with myself all alone in my apartment because I have no one to play with I overheard my roommate my freshman year of college saying that if she wasn t a pretty girl and looked more like me she would have huge self esteem issues Men at school always assume I m flirting with them because I m ugly and they are better looking than me Truth is I ve never flirted with a guy in my life and I actively try to avoid coming off as remotely close to flirtatious because I know how ugly I am I m years old and I ve never even been on a date or for that matter had any romantic physical contact with a guy at all However behind my back if I even talk to a guy about homework his friends will make fun of him for talking to the hideous chick At the gym I do pullups in the weightroom and no one cares Blonde comes and struggles to do pullups guys are already hitting on her and complementing her on her strength That was the moment I knew my life is not worth living because none of my efforts will be worth anything to anyone I feel very emotionally isolated Everyone bullied me verbally and physically in middle and high school because I am extremely unattractive In middle school people beat the crap out of me everyday for personal satisfaction and I always made up stories to explain why I had bruises and little cuts everywhere a broken nose and once a concussion In high school people were occasionally mean but most ignored me Even makeup can t fix my extremely unattractive features believe me I ve tried Time has proved that my efforts will never be worth anything to anyone and I m just ranting to myself so I can have the courage to do what needs to be done Goodbye everyone Oh wait I have no one to say goodbye to because no one cares,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

I ve caused all of my problems yet I can t fix any of them And I m tired of trying When I was I felt so isolated and lonely that I started turning to people on the internet for attention I talked to one guy who convinced me that we were in a real relationship and things happened But because it was all online I convinced myself that there was nothing anyone could do about it so I have kept it a secret for years And it has affected me so badly I ve been thinking about it a lot and it s no coincidence that I have been uncontrollably binge eating the past few days I ve been thinking about it a lot and it s no coincidence that I want to cut a criss cross pattern into my legs I ve been thinking about it a lot and it s no coincidence that I feel like I should take all of the pills I can find and not wake up It shouldn t be affecting me like this it was a long time ago and I agreed to it I knew it was wrong and bad and I went along for months I m partly to blame yet I can t move on And there s no way to fix this It happened years ago I should get over it Instead I m laying here at in the morning thinking of ways to end it all Obviously this is not the only reason It s just the one on my mind right now Another wonderful reason to end it all is that I am in the wrong body That s right buds I m a tranny have fun judging my pathetic life Also I m depressed To be fair most people are But still it just keeps getting worse I ve been waiting years for it to get better even though all of my problems are my own fault I can t fix it and I m pretty sure that I m just too broken So maybe I should just give up,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium

out of the booth and weaved his way clumsily through the crowd of club goers dancing to the emo trap bangers that the dj kept playing The track currently being played was pure fire a song called Helena Remix by My Chemical Romance and Metro Boomin featuring Savage The doctor soon found it difficult to tame his hips which had an incredible desire to begin swinging to the beat He pinched himself on the back of his left hand reminding himself of the task at hand the woman Nothing else mattered With newfound confidence he found himself able to resist dancing to the infectious club banger He walked over to the booth of the young woman and sat across from her May I ask madam what you are drinking He said smoothly speaking in a heavy British accent He flashed an awkward smile revealing his polished white teeth and unhealthy blood red gums The contrast was frightening He winked at her Take a sip she said as she pushed her glass towards Blivious He took it and had a short sip It tasted strongly of ketchup It was a local brew the Ketchbrau a ketchup infused beer The doctor raised one eyebrow and proceeded to gulp down the rest of the Ketchbrau in seconds Um sir The woman began That was my Yes yes Blivious waved his hand dismissively I shall buy you another madam he said with a strong Russian accent Tis will only take a moment m lady He stood up and went towards the bar As he walked he bulged his chest feeling prideful about the progress he had made with the woman All signs were looking good One Ketchbrau over here kind sir He cried at the bartender who nodded in response Actually he added Make it two Ketchbrau After receiving the drinks Blivious returned to the woman s booth He slid one drink towards her and she sipped it slowly as she eyed him suspiciously So she said I d appreciate it if you d introduce yourself She squinted at him Very well madam He said with a heavy French accent The woman frowned at the sudden accent change You are speaking to the widely acclaimed Dr Blivious Brainwits I have a Ph D He smiled Charmed yet madam He smiled even wider His gums appeared to stretch almost as if they may split in half It was frightening The woman frowned even harder making it appear as if she now had a unibrow So now that you know my credentials madam may I know yours He pulled a wooden pipe from his pocket and brought it to his lips He lit the pipe and began sucking down the fumes of the poison ivy he was smoking Not a single trace of smoke escaped from his lips He felt his lungs burning within his chest Seeing this the woman frowned further still her forehead becoming wrinkled and distorted from the effort Her forehead looked like that of an old woman I m uh call me Lindsey Lindsey Cocksworth She said still frowning Cocksworth Asked Blivious surprised Cocksworth sounds like a good sign he thought He smiled to himself Erm no I mean yes she blushed Blivious pulled his pipe from his mouth and put it to his nose inhaling the fumes It tickled the inside of his face Lindsey frowned even further her forehead contorting beyond what should have been humanly possible It was a horrible sight to behold Interesting surname madam May I ask of its origins He raised one eyebrow taking on a sensual and suggestive expression Well the woman suddenly stopped frowning and began smiling instead Want to find out doctor She winked Blivious suddenly felt something bulging in his underwear It was a sensation he hadn t felt in a long time Oh madam he gasped That is quite the suggestion I just may have to take you up on that offer He shifted in his booth leaning in closer to the woman Gladly Blivious sped down the street in his Lamborghini Corvette hybrid the Lamborvette It was a custom vehicle of his own design Lindsey sat in the passenger seat singing along to every emo trap banger that came on the radio She had been singing along to DaBaby s BOP Remix featuring Gerard Way and Travis Barker when they pulled into the doctor s driveway Blivious stepped out of his car and began walking towards the front door Lindsey close behind He slid the key in opening the door and turned to watch Lindsey as she walked towards him Despite the darkness of the night he thought he could see something protruding from between her legs Blivious blinked and rubbed his eyes thinking he was imagining things Lindsey walked into the house with the doctor who shut the door behind them The woman instantly pushed Blivious onto the couch asserting her dominance She let out a low inhuman growl Blivious was lying on his back looking up at the woman as she stripped her clothes off He smiled at her Until he saw her cock It was a massive juicy thick hunk of meat far beyond the length and girth of the average penis It was almost two feet long and several inches wide Blivious was about to stand up and run away but Lindey s growls intimated him and he dared not make a move As she growled he suddenly realized that her mouth was not moving He looked at her penis and realized the head of the penis had a mouth reminiscent of that of a dog Ma mad madam Blivious stuttered You you Silence She cried speaking from both her mouth and her penis at the same time The voice coming from her mouth was shrill and high while that of her cock was low and gritty They spoke in perfect unison I did not sign up for this madam He yelled using a heavy Nigerian accent GrrrrrrRAOW the penis said The woman looked down and began patting her penis as if it were a pet Shh she whispered to her cock Her cock grumbled in return Seeing her distracted the doctor made a run for it He rolled off the couch and quickly got to his feet sprinting to the door He had almost made it No No Madam you can t I can she said as she dragged him by his leg back towards the couch She let out a sinister cackle Nothing will stop me Blivious whimpered in despair as Lindsey tore his shirt off She began gripping and yanking on his pants struggling to pull them off as he squirmed desperately on the couch Her cock was now fully erect it s length almost five feet as it angled diagonally upwards Strangely enough however her balls were a normal size Lindsey had now ripped off Blivious s pants and underwear revealing his erect three inch dick She gripped her own penis and angled it down towards his The mouth of her penis licked it s lips preparing to give Blivious a penis to penis blowjob as tears streamed down his cheeks Her medium sized boobs began bouncing up and down by themselves as if they had a mind of their own Her nipples suddenly cracked and opened into two tiny mouths squealing excitedly Suddenly when he thought all hope had been lost Blivious had an idea He looked over towards his Amazon Echo device resting atop a table in the corner of the room Alexa He yelled Play an emo trap banger Lindsey s penis lips were only an inch away from his cock when his speakers began blasting music catching her off guard and startling her The song that began playing was WAP Remix by Cardi B and Jonathan Davis featuring Machine Gun Kelly Instantly Lindsey leapt back and away from Blivious She began uncontrollably bucking her hips front to back and side to side falling victim to the club banger Noooo She cried in protest as she began flailing and bouncing uncontrollably around the room in time with the music Ha You have been bested madam Said the doctor speaking in a thick Southern accent N not not possible Lindsey screamed Tis quite possible indeed madam He said as he stood up He put his clothes back on while the woman continued dancing uncontrollably Her penis was no longer erect and had gone back to being only three feet long and dangling He pulled his pipe from his pocket and began smoking The woman was now curled up in a ball in the corner of the room struggling to try and stop herself from dancing Blivious walked up to her and shoved his pipe up her penis mouth It howled in pain as it was lit on fire and began burning from the inside out By the time the song ended Lindsey was little more than a burnt up crusty corpse Blivious put his hands on his hips and smiled to himself Another job well done,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

How I gained weight from being Anorexic So I just made a body positivity post yesterday on my body years ago vs my body now days ago I received a lot of love and support so thank you But a lot of people asked me questions and here is my answer What is anorexia In the DSM the book of mental illnesses and disorders yes I have read it yes I read it sometimes anorexia is defined as A Refusal to maintain bodyweight at or above minimally normal weight for height age less than th percentile B Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming obese even though underweight C Disturbed by one s body weight or shape self worth influenced by body weight or shape or persistent lack of recognition of seriousness of low bodyweight D In menstruating females absence of at least consecutive non synthetically induced menstrual cycles I can safely say I fit all that and went through all that all my years being anorexic and recovering although I am technically still in recovery How did I gain weight I started taking vitamins such as vitamin D C omega fish oil pills they are huge and hard to swallow centrum which is a women s multivitamin so men you guys should take the male one I also take iron supplements because it turns out I was also anemic low iron Eat whatever you want whenever you want A lot is convincing yourself it s okay to eat this and it s okay to splurge I remember I felt very guilty fat ugly gross I had tried throwing it all up even but that will just make you feel worse I used to eat and eat and eat until my stomach felt beyond full and I felt like throwing up but then pushed through and slept it off Eating more will make more space in your stomach so the feeling of being too full will be farther away and achieved by eating even more It s like tricking yourself into eating more eat greasy food the grease is fat and fat content is what you need to gain weight I ate a shit ton of junk food I also ate a shit ton of rice and beans and tofu and paneer and cheese Milk products white bread pastas candy chocolates on my period I would convince myself the chocolate was needed Don t work out I guess part of it was my depression but I didn t work out at all I used to do yoga but then I got injured and was unable and I noticed how much weight yoga actually burned and kept from me gaining weight So I have not been working out I ve just been letting the weight build up Make excuses to eat Breakfast is very important I found that I have a newfound love for everything bagels with a shit ton of butter and salt with iced coffee so everyday I eat that for breakfast Go out to eat I know not everyone can afford this but I mean like McDonald s or something if you buy the food yourself and see how much it actually cost you can convince yourself you have to eat it because you spent so much money on it Family and friends used to bully me and skinny shame me So many skinny jokes so many anorexic jokes and I was so fucking tired of it all so I was like you know what I ll show you They still make those jokes but not as much anymore Some say I ve gotten to a better weight and I m doing good My mom calls me fat when she gets mad and although I get mad at least she s not calling me bones anymore Anyway I hoped this helped or helps you guys snd doesn t get lost in new Again I m very thankful for the support and also thanks to the mod who removed creepy shit from my post I posted it at night and woke up in the morning to nothing but positivity,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Found empty Xanax wrappers in little sisters F bathroom Do I tell our parents I was looking for something in our shared bathroom and came across a little metal tin when I shook it I heard rattling When i opened the tin I found empty g Xanax pill wrappers She does not have a prescription and no one else in my family does She is currently away at boarding school and will not return until June I don t understand why she is so problematic she has even had a run in with the law once before We come from a very good family with incredible loving parents she goes to an amazing and extremely expensive private boarding school which she loves and none of my siblings have had issues the way she has I am getting so fed up with her I found other things in her room before but not said anything because I don t want to rat on her But we live in a country where drug abuse is punishable by death and she has already had brushes with the law before here which is a huge deal in this country I don t want to upset my parents or worry them they are already dealing with their own issues But I am scared she doesn t understand how addictive and damaging Xanax is nor the consequences she will run into if she is caught illegally purchasing prescription pills in this country my father could even loose his job and residency status as a result if she is caught But also maybe I am overreacting She is a teenager and we all make mistakes and are stupid at that age I m just scared that because she has lived such a privileged consequence free life she willingly continues to make terrible life choices and mess around with things that could ruin her What should I do,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Trying to stay strong but don t know what my options are and I don t want to throw my life away I ve had a long history with depression and anxiety and usually I m able to push through until things stabilize again and enjoy life until the next wave hits Another wave hit a few weeks ago and this one hit hard Hard enough that it was the first time I ve taken action and woke up next to a a spilt bottle of pills and vodka and dry heaved for about an hour before calling into work sick the next two days This scared the shit out of me Scared me enough that I haven t touched alcohol in the past two weeks But I still feel just as bad as I did that day and I don t want whatever snapped inside of me that night to happen again About six months ago I started a new job I knew it would be a challenge but it was an opportunity I couldn t turn down Lately I can barely make myself show up to even fill the spot at the desk You know when you just made a huge mistake and feel your stomach tighten up That s how I feel all the time My depression is affecting my performance which makes me feel even worse and I know people are noticing I want to do better but I just can t right now and I m afraid they ll either find someone that can do better or I ll drive myself to snap again I don t want to feel like a failure and certainly not because of my stupid brain But I don t know what my options are If I keep grinding I m afraid I ll snap again soon If I leave I ll ruin this opportunity and possible future ones because I m leaving after only months for unclear reasons I don t want to throw my career away but I never want to end up where I was a couple of weeks ago again either And I don t know how to do both right now,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Set a date writing letters now This is my first time I ve ever posted anything on reddit but I needed to I m currently years old I ve never tried to find help but I first remember feeling like total shit in Year years old I constantly felt like people were judging me for everything back stabbing etc I felt like this until the start of Year years old until it sorta clicked that I shouldn t really care what people think of me I recently had a relapse I guess you could call it that I constantly feel guilty that there are people in much worse conditions than me and here I am wollowing in my own pity I don t like to trust people with secrets or feelings I haven t cried in over two years because I don t like people to see my weakness I think I ve pretty much forgotten the feeling of crying it s just so foreign to me now I think the main reason I feel utterly horrible is the fact I recently discovered what I want to do with my life I have always had an obsession with the stars and space To a point where I don t want to live on this hell hole of a planet anymore It doesn t actually feel like I belong here anymore I think my whole life is just one reason and that s to get off Earth just once I just want to see everything with my own eyes I began to look things up started looking at what I needed to get into a good sixth form and stuff like that I ve always been pretty good at school I m in top sets for everything but my grades have just been getting lower and lower I need B s in my GCSEs to get into the sixth form I want to go to After that I need to get into a good university to take physics and get at least a bachelor s degree This may all seem pretty easy for some I was this person until months ago but I just have this constant feeling I m going to fail at everything That my whole life depends on whether I get a certain grade when I m years old Society just seems to be constantly screwing me over I can t vote yet and my whole life is in the hands of someone else The government just seems to be so corrupted from my point of view All I see in the media is constant lies I m not saying it s the illuminati or anything like that but I can t see a man David Cameron who took history and political economics the one that doesnt actually teach proper economics it s probably teaching how to screw over a country at degree level not destroying the UK Just as a bonus George Osborne actually took History and got a in it fun times Anyway that s off the point The point was that my life just seems so pointless when I just feel like I m failing and there is literally no chance that I ll achieve my dream any time soon I ve set a date I ve actually given myself quite a long time I want to see if my life will turn around any time soon Surprisingly it s after my GCSEs have finished I m still in year another year to go yet I ve began to write letters already though Sorry if that felt a bit ranty there s really only one person in the world I want to talk to about this but I fear that he wouldnt come to my aid I really just needed to let it all out Tl Dr year old in a messed up world where dreams can t be fulfilled doesn t see much point in living,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

I just feel so worthless I m have had severed depression since I was and I m so frustrated and anxious I m in my fifth year of a year degree and working minim wage racked with credit card debt I just want this to be over with I feel like such a waste of a human being Bevause I m so depressed I can t bring myself to do basic things like cleaning the house I can barely get to work and have panic attacks almost every night The only things that help are just adding more fuel to the fire I overeat and have gained lbs from stress eating And when I get stressed about eating to much I throw it up I smoke and drink too I m such a failure I don t see how I m allowed to live while being such a huge disappointment And of course I feel awful because I know there are people who have it wayyy worse off than me I have no room to be this whiny and sensitive I just want to be free from all of this Clearly My depression isn t going to go away anytime soon so I can t help but think that maybe I should just end it and save myself the pain Sorry for the long post,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Everyday is filled with painI really just need someone to listen that I don t know in real life because I m scared of the consequences of bringing this up I will try to not make a wall of text as much as I can but please try to read I ve had a history of anxiety depression and currently am taking lamotrigene and klonopin to manage that I m and entering my senior year of college soon and I am so fucking scared In less than a year I will be graduating college with a terrible gpa can t be better than even if I make straight A s from now because I was in an Engineering program that took me years to figure out that I couldn t handle so it ruined that I became a general studies major in math music and education because I couldn t decide on what exactly my passions are and feel directionless I m going to try to branch out more but I m basically always stressed out because of job opportunities after college and losing all of my friends I ve made over the years as they move on with their lives and find jobs elsewhere This is all important because I had the best friend in the world for quite a few years and a little less than a year ago we decided that we couldn t live without eachother might as well date lots of happy crying and whatnot We fell in love quite quickly and I will say that I was probably in love with her for years seeing as we hung out about every other day A couple of months ago when our old leases ran out we moved in together Everything seemed perfect I found a reason to live my depression cured Mutual love really is the best thing in the world and without it life seems gray Quickly after moving in together she became distant and less affectionate Last monday she spoke about an old ex who she felt ended prematurely and has been texting him regularly and full on cried about how she felt torn She s also depressed and bipolar so it could be a phase but it hurts a lot all the same I can t in a reasonable amount of space convince someone that doesn t know me or her how much I feel for her and how important she is to me but just know that I literally love her more than my own parents She s become much less open about discussing the future and when asked about our relationship she says We ll see where it goes It s all driving me mad life really isn t worth it without love right She brought me the most happiness anyone had ever brought me and now I feel crushed because it s much less reciprocated If she doesn t leave me now she ll leave me when she graduates in less than a year it feels like It hurts so much I live with her I see her posters her room her clothes her food EVERYTHING Everyday I can t just escape it Everything in my home screams at me and tells me to be depressed I can t walk to the refridgerator without seeing something and saying Huh we got that when we were really happy I ll never be happier than that It fucking sucks It doesn t help that she brings up bad stuff and then has been leaving frequently for vacations while I m left to do summer school classes with intense indoor work and struggling with mustering the willpower to continue despite my pain I feel so much pain that I can t sleep at night I wake up in the morning and I feel like I fucked up so hard by falling madly in love with a girl with so many personal issues in the sense that I don t know if it s even her fault Everyday I daydream about ending all of this pain researching different ways that might be painless and entertaining the idea of just getting my klonopin script next month and taking it all with some liquor or something I don t know man I m in the most stressful part of my life and ontop of that I love this girl like no other I ve been in a few relationships before but I just know that life can t possibly get better than that I reached the happiest point of my life with my best friend and girlfriend and continuing on with this amount of pain feels pointless A life without my best friend is not worth living she s the only person I ve ever been able to confide in On top of this I feel like I should admit that the past month or two I have become a mild alcoholic drinking the equivalent of a pack nearly every day I also have started smoking weed about once an hour while awake and benzos do a wonderful job of suppressing the pain I take adderal though so that allows me to do all of this but still get good grades in school somehow I do it all to hide from reality Oh man I m just laughing at how fucked up things are getting so quickly I m sorry if this was a bit long but I appreciate your time,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

How to I rebuild I asked my friend to describe the night he randomly came over to my place and found me trying to over dose I remembered very little from the night and wanted to try and piece together the parts nearly a year later so I can try and rebuild my self Here is what he sent me and I ve got to be honest it s just reminded me of how willing I was to pass and now I m just angry and upset that it didn t work It was all to do with Ex girlfriend who cheated me and left me in stupid amounts of debt I walked in and you was listening to Lil Peep but the version you d done Proper deep lyrics You was zoned out Completely vacant Non responsive but awake Covered in vomit Off your head Flat trashed throwing up blood You d given up You didn t want help I rang you an ambulance You refused to go with them You said you was scared of me because I was being passive aggressive cause I was demanding to know where your stash was And I was shouting You thought I was gonna kill you you was that far gone You lied to me about not having any and you d taken them all Until I went to roll a cig and found a bag of Xans in a pot And I snatched them and you begged me to give them back you got angry at me for refusing I couldn t help you I had to ring an ambulance At that point I genuinely thought you d have done anything to get those xans back and you had a blade next to you So I snatched your flat keys as well and took the bag and locked you inside whilst I rang an ambulance It was heavy shit bro You had completely given up Since that night I ve moved got clean become a manager of a campsite at the the side of the biggest lake in Italy and started earning more money than I ever thought possible for myself Yet I still can t look people in the eye or develop a genuine connection with another human being It makes me so sad because I know I have fight in me to achieve good things but at the same time every single thing I do just feels so pointless even when I m having complete fun Am I a lost cause or is there steps I can take on top of medication and therapy,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
Drug addict Im stuck Ive been very sad and generally fucked up for years and have been doing the typical routine of drowning myself in drugs to hide from my feelings and emotions Last week I took an extremely large dose of xanax and then drank and drank on top of it with the basic intention of not waking up I really shouldn t have survived seeing as people have done less than I did and had passed Since then Ive been exhausted and felt like a failure because of it and was too distracted to try it again or anything worse Now Im coming back around on the same path as before I d really just love to talk to someone Thanks guys,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping",Medium
Inevitable Turning in hrs I completely wasted my s by adapting the hermit lifestyle I stayed at home playing video games watching anime or wasting hours on end living in an MMO I think the major turning point was at or I found out that my fiance was cheating on me Not just in the normal way but picture this Imagine finding out that the wedding that your fiance is planning is not to you How did I find out On Myspace if you even remember that of all fucking places On top of that she and who I thought was my friend fucked behind my back Since then I ve turned to alcohol to numb the pain Over the last decade I ve had my share of ups and downs but the valleys have been long dark and never equaling the peaks When I was about I ended up in the hospital because of a date with Xanax and schnapps After that I was diagnosed with severe depression Fast forward to more a more present time Off antidepressants for years yr salary plus day per diem house truck getting out of debt and things are looking up right No not exactly Growing up in the lower class I ve learned that money isn t everything material possessions don t mean shit I m still alone and slowly realizing that all my chances are gone I mentioned earlier about the whore but that wasn t my only encounter with love I ve been involved with two others but one only used me for sex and the other just got away Just to make things fun lets throw in candidate number four Someone whom seemed like a perfect match Smart pretty shared the same hobbies Yeah you know the catch is coming She was engaged to my best friend On top of that they were living with me After a long and emotionally draining love triangle I accepted what was happening and they got married and eventually moved out I haven t talked to either of them in years Lets come a little closer to the present day about months ago the one who absolutely destroyed me texted me Stupidly I carried the conversation I mean I thought I was finally moving on The messages eventually stopped until two months ago I can t remember if I made contact or if she did I knew that this is a toxic situation and I should ve distanced myself from it but I just couldn t help myself About a month ago I came the closest I have ever been to actually taking my own life sending apology messages to my mom and sisters The last thing I want to do is cause my family grief Now to me sitting in a hotel writing this sorry sob story Conversations with my ex continue knowing there will never be a future between us Absolutely no self esteem to even look for anyone Let alone a tinder account that has gone nowhere The feeling to finally end it is getting stronger by the day I m at wits end here I travel of the year so the comfort of home is a rare escape that I almost never have and I think it would be so much easier for a stranger to be found dead in any given community that I am found in I just thought it would be nice for someone even just a random person on the internet to read just a small portion of this fucked up dream before it is forever silenced,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium
I really hate myselfA bit of background I m a sex addict who has been going to therapy for a few months now I ve had a sex addiction problem for about years now but it became so intense over the past years that it lead me to have an affair and cheat on my wife My wife knows about the affair has stayed with me and is attending therapy with me I am not worthy of such love I dishonored her by being unfaithful to her My addiction centers around a hair salon spa fetish in addition to past instances of homosexual activity and fantasy along with transgender fantasy I identify as a straight male I love my wife but I shame her by having those thoughts I feel the hurt others have as someone who has privilege but feel as if me being gone from this earth would help ease the minds of people of color women and LGBTQ as one less straight white male that perpetuates the patriarchy Maybe it would be good if I was rounded up and executed simply for being what I am That is truly what I deserve I don t blame religion if anything its kept me going these past few years I know what Christians and the church say and I m grateful for their love but somehow I know I deserve death deep down for all I ve done and am Even if having those thoughts aren t a sin there is enough that I ve done that would make me unworthy in the sight of a holy perfect God I view myself as a worthless employee at work I work in information security but know far less than anyone on my team let alone my department I hate myself for not being as good as the people around me I am stagnant in my career and think of myself as a lazy son of a bitch who deserves nothing more than to be homeless and on the street My only solace is to drink and masturbate to numb myself to my pain Sometimes I wish I would just drink myself to death Even if family and friends had an initial shock of me being gone it would be temporary and all would move on Where have I gone wrong in all this My wife and my family all deserve a better person such as I The world would be better off with one less straight white male so it gives other people a chance to make something of themselves,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Worried about someone i met at works bar I work at a hotel bar and this evening had a chap come back after being out for the day drinking Though he had clearly had a fair bit to drink he was mostly still in sound mind for the first few hours of our chat It quickly became apparent that that he was carrying a lot of baggage PTSD childhood abuse and a few other things He is the father of someone i went to school with about years ago Have not seen any of them in that time appart from passing in the street so he felt like he could open up a little when telling me the stories but also was very stern that the conversation was between us two and no one else He spoke about the several doctors and psychologists he had visited over the years being of no help as they just kept trying to get him to move on He then described someone under his watch being killed while explaining that something like that cannot be forgotten or put out of mind I did not so much speak but rather listened to his story and what he had to say Honestly i was very overwhelmed and could not even begin to know how to reply and he mentioned several times that he had considered jumping off a near by bridge or walking infront of a train several times in the last year I think much of this is due to him having no one he feels he can talk to at home and clearly feels he is a burden on his wife over the last years He left his phone number and said that the chat had made him feel the best he had felt in months and would like to chat again Here is the problem and i feel like utter scum even thinking this way but i do not have the time or the knowledge to possibly be on call for something like this and do not know what to do If i pass his number on or try to contact his family will it destroy any trust he may have when talking to people about this But at the same time just leaving it and hoping the it was the alcohol talking is not an option as he was able to have a well thought out talk Sorry if this is a bit of a mess its fairly early late in the morning and i am still at work any advise would help Thanks,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Am I crazy or just sleep deprived So I ve been told that I have a very keen sense of smell as I can smell something cooking from across the house when no one else can smell it but sometimes I smell things that don t make a ton of sense like smelling root beer when I m alone in my room with no soda in the middle of the night and I just heard what sounded like faint whispering like the kind shows will play when they re trying to create a creepy ambiance but idk it could have been a combination of people moving around and a dripping faucet mixed with my paranoia I didn t get a lot of sleep last night and I don t tend to get a lot of sleep in general could it just be sleep deprivation I saw a therapist a while back and the whole out of body coping mechanism thing came up because I d been having a lot of that and he asked me if I d been smelling things that didn t make sense because that can mean olfactory hallucinations which can relate to psychiatric problems that tie into the out of body thing but I said no at the time because while I figured I probably had I couldn t think of any specific instances But that whole conversation kinda made me paranoid Am I fine I mean probably,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

So I ve been exercising in I think the most unhealthy I can So at just the start no I don t use drugs or steroids or have anorexia I m talking mentally so with that outta the way let s get on with it P S info for the story I m competitive year and I have a long distance girlfriend I ve been with for almost months and I use way too many commas so please forgive me So I m British and my school is right next to the Thames this means we rowing as a sport Throughout year and I always wanted to row so when year rolled around and I was finally the minimum age I could be I jumped right into it I was never an athletic kid hell no I wasn t fat I was unpopular not stand out and to put it simply below average in grades physically and probably in terms of mental health too I was very unpopular being the first kid to hit puberty at to so I was taller than others but still physically very unfit Now one thing that got me into rowing was that fact I was tall At I was approaching foot and fast One thing they don t tell you about ergo machines is that height matters A LOT I instantly got one of the best scores in the year and then it began I was launched from the background right into the spotlight I was suddenly madly competitive and mildly popular and I wanted to be the best So I was Throughout all of year nine I ground my body as hard as I could to have the body I wanted Our year was also the year where the Thames was overflowing our dock quite a bit we had about sessions in the entire year on the water the rest on the machines My body was exhausted but I wasn t eventually nearing the end of the year I managed to pull a split on metres This was a BIG deal I d beat my goal I beat metres in less than seconds to be exact My first ever time took seconds over a fifth higher I was the top of the leaderboard all day every day and my confidence showed it I felt like a king Then Covid happened Immediately I had a problem my gym wouldn t let me in even with no lockdown cause I m under and I had no ergo so we had to get one A concept was preferred as it s industry standard Cut weeks into the future and I ve nearly lost quid of my dad s money to a scam of a concept but i have the new RW NordickTrack Rowing Machine delivered by the lovely Amazon Good Great I was back But then Covid stayed my motivation slipped and I became lazy I was a tragedy if you ever saw one I was doing barely anything and my body was paying for it I was slipping from day to day of online school feeling awful and having my body go down in quality all the while But I got on with it I got back into it and I pushed my body past my limit until I got back So I feel great going back I grin to my friends as I mount the ergo and prepare to brake another of my records at the front of the pack in my arena I felt unstoppable My score was below average pitiful considering how i was and way below what I wanted expected and needed to be in the top boat By now the sport consumed me but rejected me I was getting mediocre scores and everyone else was soaring Cut about a month and I m kicked from top boat Just realized writing this forgot to say I was a year when I came back and we had a new coach she hates me She kicks me from top boat and I m crushed shaking from disappointment in myself and suddenly I m pushed back into the background I didn t matter once again I was paired with the people who wouldn t focus but in boats with people never having rowed before Wanna know the worst bit I could see the top boat speeding away from us any time I looked to my right we were finally on the river and this is how it was Now we re in lockdown again and I m determined I can t let that happen again or so I think right before I get on the ergo once more and feel a painful rash spread across my whole body So it turns out for a few months I ve had a condition where whenever my blood gets to hot or something that s when it effects me worst I break out into a rash I was struggling once more thinking it was just hayfever I struggled through each session it got worse and worse I now have medication an antihistamine to be exact fexofenadine hydrochloride to stop it Great back to it So my school is private and most of the kids have mansions and one guy I know has a gym the size of most of my house so I m at a disadvantage competitively and I ve been doing this for one and a half years when these people have been swimming competitively in their pools for most of their lives But I got too it and I m getting better with my body and I m getting better scores until there it is my name My name in gold I got the fastest score for a kilometre race in the year Remember how I said Concept s are industry standard Well that means my coach who once again dislikes me had to change my scores to be accurate To do this I sent her my average watts produced per metres a measurement which adds with to my score in a concept conversion to per metres and I did it in the km this doesn t add up if you check since it s just an average watt count but the timer didn t lie I d done it This did not matter A split second in a race does And so does my split score As I said before I beat in seconds My coach added seconds to every split I did from my home ergo and my name was wiped from the leaderboard no matter what the watt count said I was pushed forced back down I went from the best score to one of the worst Now seconds is a LOT of time and that s for each metres so instead of my original score I was forced to put up with a score of seconds slower than the original So now what do I know I can t beat anything at home now I can simply train my body for when I go back to be best again The seconds thing was weeks ago about As I mentioned I have a girlfriend she s incredible we don t see each other much and we mostly text and she was getting concerned about the strain I ve been putting on my body But I ve been insecure about everything for too long I can t handle not getting back up there I need it I crave it I was born to row I know it So I ve been doing the worst thing I can I ve lied to her Multiple times I say I m going to bed but I stay up going as hard as I physically can no longer bound by my condition Even as I write this it s AM and she thought I went to sleep at I need help I can t stop I can t keep doing this to her I feel terrible My body is sore and aching and I can t lie to her anymore it s awful I need suggestions on what to do I can t put her through me complaining more and more I can t stay down in rowing and I need to get back up I m ready to row again Also I was thinking this was just gonna be like a paragraph apparently not,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Oh where to begin I ve been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth This caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird out there bad ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me But I just shrugged it off and kept on going Then in middle school I started getting bullied couldn t walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy Then I was homeschooled in th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit But I just kept going And then in th grade I went back to school and finally made friends People still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me But I actually made friends Then in high school everything got better at first I had tons of friends who I considered family I wasn t being bullied to my face And I was actually happy Then my second year of high school started and BOOM insomnia I became extremely irritable I was sleeping in class wasn t shaving dressing like shit and so on Well I didn t know this at the time but my cyclothymia lesser version of bipolar disorder had kicked into th gear What makes matters worse is I was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist So I was getting medication But can you guess what meds I was getting Just anti depressants And for those who don t know ADs cyclothymia or bipolar disorder in my case hypomania What fun Basically for years I was mostly hypomanic I m sure you can all guess what this was like Well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance this got mistook for narcissism And a certain true narcissist didn t like this So he went around to all my friends who I considered family and told them I was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me Which of course I didn t I saw almost all of them as my equal And then it gets better he decided to assume that I was also a liar because I mentioned that I fell into a firepit when I was a kid and melted my hand together But there s no scar So I must be lying Even tho it did really happen I ll find a way to prove it to you if you don t believe me He told everyone this So practically overnight my family was gone My insomnia had gotten to the point where I was staying awake from straight hours and to cope I turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep The fallout is obvious So I m left alone addicted to xanax going fucking mad from sleep deprivation and I dropped out of high school months later I had a nervous breakdown cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder I start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls Smoking tons of weed to cope Struggling with xanax and ativan And I have no one Not a single person What s the point None of you will read this far down my rambling to read this I ruined everything But no I m apparently not allowed to be happy or have friends I just ruin everything,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

An empty chair at all the tables Reddit I don t know There are a thousand reasons to post and a thousand more to delete these words I realize that a lot of you are here to mock people like me People that complain and I realize that there are some of us who take so much for granted Who don t see what we have and dwell in the past I realize I may be one of them though I still look in the mirror and find nothing staring back My greatest moments are the mornings that I wake and can t remember who I am or why I am where I am For a small window of time I have a lot of reasons for why I think I am the way I am and they might not be an excuse I understand that But it s the only thing I can think of to get myself through the day My dad died That s all I can start it off as From junior high up to my twentieth birthday he was an alcoholic and my mother relied on prescription medication like Atavan Methadone He was the only sane parent but we cared for my ninety six year old grandmother his parents long out of state to avoid responsibility and he lost himself in the alcohol Now that I am older I don t blame him You need one way to cope and he lost the war My mother goaded him on with her bullshit She stole from me She took credit cards out under my name We moved three times a year until we finally left state From California to Texas hoping that he would fix himself I won t forget the day he died It was Five Six days to thanksgiving We had just returned from Texas left him in a trailer he bought on his retirement because my mother talked him into it I won t forget how he reeked of piss how he d lost so much weight due to some Illness or when we d drive by the trailer park every day Take him to get groceries Clothes He d always be in the driveway drunk unconscious I hated him For beating me For not being the man I knew growing up For abandoning my sister and I when we needed him the most None of his family helped us Until the day he died My grandparents found him Dead Sober for two weeks and then we fought Told him if he forced us to give him his money he would drink and we wouldn t see him again He called the night before he died Asked my sister and I to visit him Have pudding When we arrived the duct tape was up The police were guarding the trailer and they wouldn t let me see him My grandmother his mother Hugged me Said my mother better take responsibility for what had happened I was too shocked to understand They all came flooding in Family Just for the funeral after ten years of silence Ten years of not giving a shit and suddenly they don t want pissing games A week later Thanksgiving had passed They wanted to see us for the holidays Just me and my sister Just to tell us what we did wrong What they saw when they found him How they found him And to tell us word for word That we did not try hard enough They call themselves family and until now four years later It has all been the same No one is genuine I fail at every turn Twenty three No college career The only person I care about tells me I care because they re the only person that has been kind to me for years I am only a good friend I can t come back from the debt of carrying my family while my parents were unconscious for months on the couch at seventeen I can t do anything Death is not an option It never was I am afraid of the darkness The ever lasting sleep Of pain But I want it A reason to stop because I have seen what life is What true nine to five married family every day life can do to you I don t want to do it,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

How do I help my depressed friend I am scared for his life My long term friend admitted today that he was going to see a councellor because he is afraid that his mind is going like his fathers I am not sure if it s depression but that s all I can guess right now He could just be sexually frustrated as he hasn t been with someone for a long long time It s also possible that he s gay and is afraid to come out so has kept everything bottled up I am open to other suggestions His father died years ago but for more than a year before that his father changed There was not much difference at home except he was going out more They found out it was to the pub so he was drinking regularly months after that he the father apparently exposed himself to a younger female neighbor in his front garden no proof but his strange behavior made it believable The police came to sort it out He also seemed to be depressed and just sat around the house watching TV The drinking got worse until his life savings ran out to which he kept drinking on pension money until he died He died in his sleep because of a trauma wound from falling down while drunk Anyway my friend told me his brain has been funny He has been cranky with people recently and hasn t been spending time with his friends family as much as normal but still quite a lot He has admitted to looking at porn a lot and saying that some of it he probably shouldn t be looking at I have known this guy for years I am he is almost that I would do anything to help him but I don t know what I can do Please help me Reddit We are both male not partners just friends I have already told him that he can tell me anything and that if he needs anything to just give me a call to talk it over I also told him if he needs a special holiday somewhere that could help I would go with him too if he wanted I have also told him that looking at porn a lot isn t weird or anything I could do with some advice Thanks for any suggestions you can give me,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

Why is the milk gone Why did you forgot to buy milk Well that s the interesting question See you were going to get some on the way home yesterday but then you remember that you need some bread as well so u went to bread house however the alcohol store was on the way to the bread house So you went there first just because you been doing quite a lot of drinking alone and if by recently you mean last year and the have this new alcohol apple flavor vodka Which was pretty cool and you brought and then forgot to buy milk so really the milk is gone because of vodka but really you only went to buy vodka cuz it s been a cloudy day and you wanted to cheer yourself up a bit and it s only been a cloudy day because of the temperature differential brought on by east moving winds and pressure fluctuations So really the milk is gone because of the weather but the weather is only there because of the atmosphere which formed about billion years ago result of gas escaping from earths interior so the milk is gone because of the earth But the earth is only there because a gas cloud condensed into the sun and the solar system a few billion years ago and all of that came from the Big Bang billion of years before that so really the milk is gone because space and time materialized out of nothing billion years ago So if that the case Did the universe always knew that billion years when it exploded formed into galaxies and stars and they gave rise to planets and planets developed ecosystem single cell life complex organisms humans human society domestication of cows the invention of coffee milk in coffee fridges and finally you that you would eventually run out of milk billion years later Well maybe If You re playing snooker or pool or whatever and you hit a ball at a certain angle and speed and if you have a good enough computer you can say where the ball are going to go right It s all predetermined If you take the same shot times the outcome will be the same times well if the Big Bang happens time over just the way it it did billion years ago would you run out of milk a times billion later And doesn t that mean that you re life is already determined Like day of your birth and death was already predicted the moment came into being and everything has to happen in a certain way just that way just like a pool game No definitely not We ve got free will right I mean just because the universe is made of of atoms bumping into each other that have to act in a certain way based on what happened before and just because your brain is made up of atoms that doesn t mean they have to do the same thing and all are the part of the same system you can still just decided to do stuff right BECAUSE IF NOT THEN WE ARE JUST BALLS IN A COSMIC GAME OF POOL WITH NO FREE WILL AT ALL MEANING WE RE JUST ROBOTS CAUGHT IN A DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM WITH JUST ILLUSION OF CHOICE BUT REALLY HAVING NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER OVER OUR LIFE DELUDING OUR SELF INTO THINKING WE RE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT TO ALL THE OTHER ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT WOULD MEAN YOU VE NEVER MADE A REAL CHOICE AND YOU NEVER WILL AND WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO NEXT IN LIFE ISN T A DECISION AT ALL BUT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE S NO POINT TO EVER DOING ANYTHING EVER AGAIN BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS PREDECIDED AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND LIFE AND LIFE IS COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS AND EMPTY AND FUCK IT FUCK MILK black coffee is fine,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium
I JUST WANNA BE APPRECIATED a month ago i asked a nice girl in our hich school to get to know me not dating but as friends she told me politely no because our values were different i had waited a long time to ask her to meet me after school because i thought she was nice and everything i knew we had some different opinions but that s not really a problem because my best friends have the exact opposite opinions than i do i was really disappointed when she told me she didnt want to get to know me so this happened today my yr half brother was drinking in a bigger city and needed money because he had no place to go but had money for drinking with friends he and his mom and sister messaged and called me several times and asked me to borrow some money i told i could pay his bus ticket if he wanted to go home and he refused i told them i wont pay a hotel room because i want him to get better and take responsibility they all got mad and my brother said he wont be helping me in the future and then hang up he doesnt respect me at all and only calls when needs money i dont have good relationship with my parents either they dont really appreciate me and my dad once almost killed me a few years ago i just want to be loved im trying to fix our relationship but they make it hard sometimes and then a girl who goes the same high school as i do but is not following me on social media just messaged me and asked if she can ask something personal related to my religion then i just thought okay i dont give a sh t anymore and i wrote a LONG message to her explaining how people only think im this boring religious person and nothing more and im not and i told her i was used to bullied at school and that people at school didnt know how hard my personal life was i told her that i am religious but my best friends are not i am religious but i do other things as well than just read the Bible and so when she had read what i wrote she just told me i shouldnt tell people how i feel probably she was right but i thought she would say something else everything what i had just told her was forgotten and she didnt say anything about it she only asked the question and i answered her the thing is almost everyone almost every person in our school has like friends and are friends with everyone and then there is me i have one friend in our whole student school im thankful i have her but ive always wanted to have many friends and i just dont know how to get them ive tried but no what im saying is that i am way much more than just my religion although it s the most important thing to me and i can be fun and do stuff like sneak from bathroom window at night with my friends or travel to random city and stay at star hotell loose all money and ask strangers to donate me a a few dollars and i like watching cat or duck tiktoks or those tiktoks where people are tell me you are a robot without telling me you are a robot and i love watching netflix hbo disney etc i cry when i think about this world and i pray for people that dont even know i exist i would die for you who are reading this and i am super loyal to my friends i would like more people to acknowledge me im not the best person in the world and im actually pretty stupid and mean sometimes but i can be a true and loving friend if people just wanted go get to know me thank you for reading God bless you btw im a year old girl,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

What am I missing I was about to write I hope I am missing something as the title but that would be wrong I am not hoping per se more like I m checking one more time if I left the stove on before I leave There s nothing for me in here I hold very little value for money belongings social status And people are worthless to me because they value the aforementioned are making themselves about those and from those I am afraid that if I explain myself or my views fully I ll infect someone else with this but be warned I ll elaborate and will tell my views if asked they might seem not that bad at first or for a few years but it s a seed that grows slowly So don t be arrogant about it it s nothing special it s not a big secret and that s the twist Anyway There s just no point going on there s nothing here for me that I can see To me life seems to be just a waiting place for death to keep yourself busy so death can surprise you But how to keep yourself busy I nothing holds meaning to me I can t get attached to things that disappear eventually I am too emotional for that My memories of the most beautiful wonderful and magnificent people I have met are torturing me as it is And I don t want any more pain The most meaningful things hurt the most and that s why I don t want them because the pain is always the last thing of that deal That s what I am left with And if I continue regardless it will eventually lead me to the same conclusion the pain kills me Life is so beautiful that it kills me So why die in pain when it is possible to die without it If I don t take life to my heart then there s no point continuing either because I m holding back nothing is that important to me it s meaningless So here s why I am writing this is something I am missing before I make the biggest decision I can ever make An unchecked stove somewhere If so where should I look for it when I am somewhat aware of this gt A Sioux creation story says that long ago the Creator gathered all of Creation and said I want to hide something from the humans until they are ready for it It is the realization that they create their own reality gt The eagle said Give it to me I will take it to the moon gt The Creator said No One day they will go there and find it gt The salmon said I will bury it on the bottom of the ocean gt No They will go there too gt The buffalo said I will bury it on the Great Plains gt The Creator said They will cut into the skin of the Earth and find it even there gt Grandmother Mole who lives in the breast of Mother Earth and who has no physical eyes but sees with spiritual eyes said Put it inside of them gt And the Creator said It is done Also this might be a long conversation or the shortest ever with no reply So if you are not up to the challenge help someone else your words may be wasted on me Speak from the heart and if nothing comes up then continue on it s not your fight Truth should be effortless But don t be intimidated your words can make a difference who knows it can be as little as Dude you forgot to drink your coffee and then it all dawns on me lol no promises though don t beat yourself up but anyway I wanna go so did leave something undone Something worth checking out Inb ur lyfe AC movie Rogue one movie and the year Thanks in advance,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

I will never feel loved When I was younger I didn t mind not having any relationships and just hanging out with friends was enough now I just am thinking more and more about relationships with the other sex I m pretty awkward and don t really have a lot going for myself these days I mean who wants to get with someone who has no job no car not many friends and basically has no life experience or motivation to do anything I life It is what it is I guess and I m probably just gonna be alone forever and buy a dog and just chill watching the world go by I have always been a loner and probably always will be which sometimes I am fine with because I enjoy my own company and enjoy doing stuff on my own time without having to run it by everyone else I suffer from depression anxiety and panic attacks along with learning disabilities I guess you could say I m more of a liability or a burden to most people which doesn t help the relationship situation because everyone wants a finished project instead of a work in progress and that s cool people have standards and some people know what they want out of life and what they look for in a partner but sometimes the standards are set too high we re your looking for perfect person which obviously doesn t exist because we are all flawed to some extent I usually just drink a lot to help with the pain inside my mind because the buzz of alcohol helps me picture love basically alcohol is the only thing that helps me feel better and think I m loved which I know is probably not healthy but when your at the bottom you got to have some coping mechanisms otherwise you won t be able to go on with life This is basically me a nobody with no life who is left behind everyone he ever knew in life and has no motivation to do anything in life and has a lot of problems I just wonder what love feels like because it seems to mean it doesn t exist,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

what the fuck am i even doing in a kitchen whatever it s not like they even called my ICE contacts to check on me so pfft lets die ok boom lets go I think at the time I woke up again and just started dying I just felt weak like I would probably bust my head on the way to the bathroom I remember wanting to die but just panicking bc i knew that this would just end really badly I took somewhere between and hundred pills of zquil tylenol advil pms And all I could think of in the moment was fuck No anti nausea meds dumbass so I start blowing chunks obvs lost my pill count I knew if anything I just fucked up my system and it s going to be long ass week I remember smiling at whoever intubated me bc I knew it was all fucked stuck in icu for a few days but i enjoyed it my dreams were the scariest but turned into the most beautiful things after i m guessing a few days I really hoped in my heart of hearts that I was at least in purgatory I wake up to find a friend at my feet I didn t want that I wanted everyone gone I didn t tell anyone bc I really just wanted to die y ya How did this turn into a whole thing I didn t want her there or SOs mom looking at me as i lay passed out I just felt more alone with everyone Even Sos friend knew i wouldnt have minded but they stayed over like the next month and i could just feel quiet judgement or at least weird quiet no one talked about it but his friend and his SO knew his friends SO said she was glad I was ok before they left after the weekend Fucking slutbag idk u or your bf but you both are balls deep in my business ok anyway I remember waking up again on one to one but I had my phone I looked up my balance to check my deposits and either my balance was or was missing I think it was supposed to be around something or almost I bring it up to SO who got defensive saying so much was going on and he was worried MTG games Beer Cigarettes thats where the cash went He said cleaning but there was still friggin nyquil goo on the floor and the trash wasn t taken out when I got back from the loony bin call me heartless but idk i was out for a few days and hundo was gone lol how would it have been if i just died like So i was supposed to see a friend after it all almost died near Katz deli light said walk and I was inches away from getting it by a produce bus that ran the light and I felt so alive now I just wished i took a fucking step real quick I wanted to think there was a reason I was here that it was the universe saying I was leaving on her terms or not at all Go to this place to wait waited almost an hour for my friend to come by while the waiter ignored me which I guessed made me feel smaller than most times Ah well still alive but since then it feels all downhill Lost touch with that galpal but we were both sad I felt like sometimes she did things to make me feel smaller but also feel like its just the fear of inadequacy telling me that I do feel like she took me to a dark place that was unnecessary though I felt wasn t allowed to really have problems there was someone else who had something terrible happen couldnt visit or call the loony bin bc she was busy then why be over me in icu with ur sister who doesnt even know me But at a certain point I felt like she always wanted to be the little wounded deer everyone helped but refused help bc she was too tuff She talked about how certain people resented her and how shitty everyone was but I feel like she was a mean girl on the low Like she has called me crying she has been to my house at godless hours bc she was alone i have literally dressed her wounds we were thicc thieves together for a minute then I guess I got too much Always late to see me not texting for days not really asking about me and I felt like the one always seeking approval and I felt she liked that bc she also felt shit Or maybe she was too depressed for friendship and maybe i m just a needy piece of shit Alone now so who is really laughing SO has been supporting me on and off bc I can t hold a job anymore I think a few months before my big job he kept saying how I can t hold a job idk it was in an argument and now I really can t Both drank and argued a lot think it calmed officially a couple of months ago once I officially lost income for my own hard stuff Right now he is playing fortnite Before he took a nap at he was also playing it And yesterday Yes Also playing We went to the store yesterday and just holding the basket not talking about anything not discussing anything he just took time off work to get a different job and I feel like I am good bc I am convenient I gave up my lease to be with him and now I feel like it s an obligation to take care of the things he can t won t because he supports me and is happy with me sometimes I feel like he s just been accustomed to having a plus one it s not like a partner I have no one and no where to go no money and no income as unhealthy as we are together sometimes he is all I have here aside from immediate family he talks to sometimes I feel like I am also his only friend sometimes i don t want to die I just want to go far away so he can develop on his own He doesn t get depression and I remember even throwing a noose I made at him he was shocked and we stopped arguing that night but guess where that noose is still on my dresser and we live in a studio wild I ve had terminations and one miscarriage st was bc of my new job which was a simple choice save up and start then the second I had been home from hospital for a little over a month the last one I got a pill to finish bc I was but it was gone already He doesn t want to be a father he said yes the last time but it was so scared and hollow i just had to go with my gut and went to the doc for the news and I don t think we should raise a child who will grow up around resentment im a foster kid so tbh i would rather be a single mom but that was a whole thing so I can t see myself having his child and remaining happy for the next year even still think what would have happened had I just hit the road and started my own thing for me and my kid think I wouldve been a good mom my dad friend keeps telling me to make moves to get back into painting but I wasnt even great at I don t want anymore tiring adventures It seems so pointless I m not even sure if direction is necessary anymore I feel like I can t find my footing I m fucking tired of the kitchen but i ve been here since I was it s all I am I feel if you re not planning on being a chef you ll be a linecook forever while there s no shame in an honest job I feel like I wanted more from this life I wanted to dream and I feel like I dreamt too big I feel like Death is laughing at me and just waiting for me to fully get it through that I am alone i feel like anyone s attempts to help are meant to sate their own senses of fulfillment no one knows me no one really cares,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping,

Sensorimotor OCD and suicideSince August of last year I ve been obsessed with the physical sensation of breathing This initially came from an immense cannabis triggered anxiety attack which then latched onto how short of breath I felt in those days Like any other affliction it seems to fluctuate from being tolerable most days to being something that makes me have multiple panic attacks on a daily basis Hyperventilation and this naturally go hand in hand since because I m unwillingly focused on every breath I take I end up getting more oxygen in than my body really needs My life doesn t have a lot going for it right now even though compared to last year I m probably over the moon I have a job after being unemployed for more than a year even though I hate work with a passion regardless of whatever job it is and am in the first romantic relationship I ve ever been in in my life Regardless of all of these positives this breathing obsession ebbs and flows to the point where the past three quarters of a year have felt like a long winded dark night of the soul If things get worse again I feel as though I want to fade to black for good I ll miss my partner I love him to pieces I ll miss the few friends that call once in a blue moon but I just don t know if I can live with this anymore I ve tried half a dozen antidepressants I ve tried eating better I ve tried exercising I ve gone to therapy and practiced CBT and nothing s worked I don t know what to do anymore I don t want to hurt my partner but I don t know how much longer I can go on living like this It s alienating it s hard as hell to talk to anyone at all about this because I know nobody who s ever dealt with this It s maddening I feel my sanity on the verge of snapping I can t deal with it anymore,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Just need some mental help here Not sure how to go on So i ve dealt with depression for a very long time Nothing too severe the majority of the time but sometimes it just spikes and I get happy at the thought of not having to deal with Life You know I got laid off at the beginning of december after having a shitty paycheck for taking a week off due to being sick and as you can imagine I ve run out of money I ve had in my bank account for around a week and a half now after having to pay for a traffic ticket that wasn t really my fault That s what they all say and I m living off of one box of brown rice I found in the back of my pantry I thought I had found a job that could get me through until I found a real one and I was elated but it turned out to basically be a scam I ve made a grand total of for hours of work and I wont even be getting that for another week So you can imagine going from elated to absolutely crushed has ruined me both mentally and physically I don t think I left my room today other than going to the bathroom It s and I haven t even had a drink today And to top all of this off Apparently Hulu can overdraft my bank account even though I told chase when explicitly asked to NEVER let my account be overdrawn So now my bank balance is And I ll be charged a fee for that which I wont be able to pay because I ve only made dollars So there s another fee on top because of that that I won t be able to pay And on and on and on Added to this the fact that if I want a real job at any point in the near future I need to go through college getting myself further into debt even though I don t even know what I want to do for a career anymore I just don t see the actual point of being alive when all I am is unhappy or happy but waiting for a problem to present itself What do Help,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

Really need someone to talk to I ve had social anxiety ever since I decided to go to a different school than all the people I grew up with during the transition from elementary school to high school During the early years in my life up to grade I wasn t socially anxious at all in fact I was always the one to make people laugh and put on a show didn t mind the spotlight The only problem was these people I never really felt like I fit in with the people I grew up with I d get invited out occasionally but I never really fit it so I decided to start over by going to a different high school This would be the worst decision of my life During my two years there I was paralyzed with anxiety made one friend and began to get depressed While everyone was out enjoying life and hanging out with friends I was glued to the computer getting lost in video games as an escape from reality I would play every second I had and I feel that s what lead me to develop an anxiety disorder Oddly enough I still had no problem going to and from class or walking alone in public or anything of that nature That was years ago I m now and have been through a lot since then After being diagnosed back in I was on various drugs most of them didn t work except for one cipralex For one whole year cipralex had effectively convinced me that my socially anxious days were over I could finally be that person I d always wanted to I always knew that I had that person in me but the anxiety was preventing me from being that person After a year of feeling on top of the world the medication started to lose it s effect and I slowly spiraled downward I was pretty bummed at this point I started reading up on social anxiety on the internet I wanted to know how it worked once I knew that I could surely put an end to it over time This is when I learned about cognitive behavioral therapy I originally got a book by David D Burns to overcome my anxiety but quit half way through I ended up living with the fact that I was anxious for a few years but back in December of I came across an audio series on overcoming social anxiety The series required you to listed to a tape each week and read over the handouts for that session every day And I was faithful I d read way past the recommended minutes a day often To be perfectly honest I now know more about SA than I have in my life and I m currently still on the program a little over half way through and being faithful I ve put many of the strategies and methods learned into every day life and have had some success I ve been able to calm myself down at times and focus more externally by rationalizing my irrational thinking and taking them into a situation that would normally make me anxious At this point you re probably thinking that I posted this in the wrong section and that it sounds like things are looking up Well they are and they aren t Getting over an anxiety disorder will cause relapses so I could have my anxiety under control for a few days and then a few days after feel like a wreck I m supposed to be looking at relapses as a positive thing because you can t have a relapse if you haven t made progress And I admit I have Here s the issue Although I have this whole whack of knowledge now and have seen in work first hand this requires a lot of work mentally See before I knew any of this I d just let the negative thinking flow freely but now anytime that occurs there are steps and things I need to do to escape for the vicious circle of anxiety On top of that there are things I m having trouble with now Getting out of the house can be a nightmare at times driving is nerve wracking at times Anytime I m stopped next to someone at a red light I tense up and freeze because I feel they are looking at me Even though I know that feelings can be false because they are created by thoughts and my thoughts are irrational Getting a job is another obstacle I ve yet to overcome I graduated from college months ago and have been unemployed since and to be honest as of late I ve been pretty much cooped up in my house with the occasional outing on weekends to a bar or lounge Every day when I wake up I know I have to prepare myself for another mental struggle with myself and it s tiring My friends don t usually contact me unless I initiate first And recently a friend who I ve known since I was has been really distant for some reason Bottom line is is it worth it I m no job can t even go to the store without having a battle with my own mind I just don t know what to do My family knows I have Anxiety but not specially Social Anxiety They don t understand that these simple things like going to the store or applying for a job are very challenging for me They chalk it up to me being lazy and unmotivated when in actuality if I had rid myself of this I would have be the polar opposite I want a future I don t want to be a deadbeat But at the same time there s only so long I can continue to get rid of my SA before I become tired I m starting to learn toward the it s not worth it side Can anyone give me some advice any advice If you read my entire post I really appreciate it TLDR Had a rough time in highschool no friends eventually diagnosed with social anxiety many years later tried medication that worked but eventually stopped Been doing cognitive therapy for the past months seems to be working but recently questioning whether or not it s even worth it anymore,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

I think it s time I don t know how it could get worse Hello everyone I can t take it anymore I ve been a depressed gamer type most of my life A few friends here and there I was actually one of the few nerds that hung out with the cool kids at school I wasn t even socially inept but the constant stress of my wrecked home life and constant fights between my parents who hate each other were the only thing on my mind for a long time Years ago i suffered from Psychosis after stopping regular weed consumption I went crazy basically After that my then girlfriend of years wanted to help me To be there for me Even though I accomplished nothing at the time and just rotted away even getting back into weed I pushed her away I ended it because I knew that I wasn t nearly good enough for her She was stupid for clinging on to me It felt so good to be with her but I hated myself more and more for what little I could do for her and how I sometimes talked to her full of self hatred Now to the current situation A few months ago I had another psychotic break My girlfriend left me I lost a nice job After that I just went into a stupid deep hole and smoked cigarettes and sometimes joints a lot One evening I smoke go to bed and suddenly get these weird shakes I feel like I can t breathe Turns out I had a stroke Two or three times since I m now years old hat psychotic breaks and or strokes My heart also hurts constantly I might have had a heart attack or have angina pectoris or something like that Due to my psychological history the hospitals I went to wouldn t keep me for check ups I only got appointments for doctors in months I feel how weak and stupid I m getting though Numbness and kind of paralysis in my left side Trouble finding words forming sentences I went from being the handsome smart guy with all the opportunities in the world to basically being ready for retirement or a caring facility in the course of a few years Weed and the lifestyle that came with it did most of it The best part It s all my fault There is no injustice going on here Maybe it s karma actually working for once The thing that REALLY tears me up is how much I let my parents and friends down My parents had hard lives and worked their asses of to give me every opportunity Sadly they didn t know how to nourish a child emotionally or had too many problems among themselves to notice my emotional needs when I was younger but they fought for what they thought was the right thing to do The people I can call my friends right now actually care about me They want to help me They look after me write me I just can t be helped As much as I hate admitting it seeing them go on with their lives and being happy gives me the reality check of how bad my situation actually is When I m not around anyone I distract myself so much on the internet that I actually forget about my problems This behaviour is what has gotten me to where I am in the first place but now it s too late to turn back Sadly I still don t know whether I will be able to go through with vanishing from this planet My mind and life are so fucked that I know only hell can await me in our realms here though To my friends and family I am sorry for letting you guys down I love you,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress",Medium

um Hello so I just found this sub today like within the last hour and I saw the top post of all time and it made me feel okay I had a blowout today cause of all the stress that has been accumulating college and being able to pay it having to pass a drug test and not having weed to calm me down people pissing me off Punched a couple of things and now some of my knuckles are kinda swollen Was looking around online and found this http www mayoclinic org diseases conditions cyclothymia basics symptoms con and it felt right Maybe I have it My mom is bipolar and has a boat load of other problems so I know I inherit stuff from her Idk I m kinda just blabbing right now Anyway I found this and after reading that top comment it made me feel like I wasn t completely alone anymore I know I have my parents and my girlfriend to back me up and a couple of friends even if they don t know the whole situation but I just feel like they are saying what everyone says Stay in college you ll be happy you stuck t out Don t worry I m here for you Go make yourself feel better Eat workout read I know They are all right and I love them for it It s just sometimes I just want some one to say It s okay for you to feel like this It s okay to drop out It s okay to yell and scream and freak out It s going to be okay My gf said that earlier and I love her for it It s just sometimes I feel like I need a psychiatrist that won t take anything personally If I tell them to fuck off and I want them to go away they won t Cause I don t mean it I m just so angry with myself with what I feel like is no control with feeling like shit with just everything I know there are people in worse positions than me My dad s friend for years is in the hospital for something they don t really understand There are kids here in the US that are abused homeless and deserve more I understand this Which makes me even madder at myself cause I feel like little b ch who is freaking out because his life isn t what he wants it to be This isn t who I planned to be who I want to be who I want my children if I live long enough to have them to see Sometimes I just want to lock myself in a dark room and never come out So no one has to deal with me and my bs anymore I held my chef knives up to my throat today it was so simple All I had to do was pull but I couldn t do it I just couldn t I know it s selfish but I m not thinking it like that Sure the sadness will be here now but once I m done I can t cause anymore disappointment anger sadness false hope I just want someone to understand and say It s gong to be okay You don t have to have do this anymore It s going to be okay,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

This is horribleI wouldn t wish this on anyone This is torture mentally day in and day out I feel like I m feet underwater every day I ended up cutting out all friends for weeks because I got the point I assumed I was a terrible person that my life was over and that I had to end it Over the last two months I got back in touch but the damage was done I feel I don t even know what I m typing I have no hope I m so lost I hate this Long story short I had a paranoid schizophrenic alcoholic Dad who died of cancer when I was or My parents separated when I was like I remember watching quietly from the top of the staircase in my grandparent s home hearing him beg my Grandpa saying I don t want to die Well he did I grew up in poverty Had horribly messed up teeth I mean seriously that I couldn t get fixed until I was but by then I felt like and asshole for fixing them and for people for giving a shit they were messed up No money or assistance at all for college Arbitrary heavy anxiety and depression causing me to fail out twice despite professors telling me how smart I was It doesn t matter how intelligent you are if your brain has been melted by past trauma apparently After refusing to do substances of any kind well into adulthood I fell into drugs and drinking Patched me up quite nicely for a while but obviously as the cliche always goes it made me worse in the long run I ve been essentially sober the last year or so but my brain is just too messed up from all of it I went off the anti depressant I was on Effexor apparently the hardest to get off of over the last year and I m sure that s part of it but I ve also read that long term anti depressant use can just lead to tardive dysphoria or a treatment resistant depression for life What s the point I m not saying my own choices don t have something to do with where I am but I also think terrible childhood plus crushing poverty plus inhereted mental illness addiction my Dad s giant catholic family had a lot of it might also have something to do with that Statistically most people that grow up in poverty stay there and I see why Not that it matters This is just an arrangement of characters on the internet and it s admist this huge fucking sea of misery thousands upon thousands of posts and each of us all of us have lived these lives and it is such an epic undertaking to live a life to experience all of this To have it reach this point to be so keenly aware of how miserable you feel that s torture I can t even put words to it to be alive but want to die but wish you could see a way to live because you re still alive It s torture,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

HOOOOOOOOLY FRICK I JUST STEALTHED BACK UP TO MY ROOM WHILE MY MOM WAS AWAKE BUT ALSO PEED IN MY UNDERWEAR So lemme start with a basic layout of the house My computer is in the basement my mom sleeps on the living room couch and my room is on the second floor The stairs that go from floor to floor are right next to where my mom sleeps I was on my computer in the basement playing a game that didn t end till AM when my bedtime was AM I turn off the lights when it hits so if my mom looks at the door she can tell I m not awake The game finishes at three and I shut everything off But the moment I do that I hear my mom get up to go to the bathroom from above me I realize I lost my shot to go upstairs seamlessly Also I suddenly really had to pee My first thought was Oh god oh heck oh frick I NEED TO PEE So I began devising a plan to get to my room where there is a bathroom I first thought to wait a couple minutes to hopefully hear her snore As I m waiting I try to think of a safety net excuse to lighten the blow I strip to my underwear so that if I were caught I might have a slim chance of explaing that I couldn t fall asleep and I was getting a drink or something minutes pass no snoring I hear her shift on the couch again I really need to pee at this point it s go now or die I begin heading up the stairs and as I hit the rd to last step I hear a couple of drops of liquid hit the carpeted stairs Thankfully it really was only a couple drops I look to see with my phone light that my underwear is now streaked with urine Cool deal with that later I continue heading up the stairs and I finally reach the same room my mom is sleeping I need to pee now I quickly yet quietly walk to the bathroom that my mom just used which is right next to the living room and relieve the urge that has been there for so long At this point I think I screwed myself There is now way she didn t hear me go to in the bathroom I wait a couple min and decide to just go I walk past her as quiet as possible Quickly crouch and climb the stairs on all fours the stairs that go upstairs have a foot wall of one side that block her vision and finally get to the second floor I see my room I pretty much made it I walk to my room silently and successfully make it without her noticing Now I wait till morning to see if she really didn t notice,"Maladaptive Coping, Cause of Distress",Medium

How do you describe how bad you feel xpost from r getting over itI am AWFUL at putting how I feel into words A lifetime of trying to hide my mental illness from others and distract myself from how terrible I feel has left me with an inability to explain it to others and a skewed idea of what normal is amp nbsp Long story short I was diagnosed with Major Depression and General Anxiety disorder at I m now and was later diagnosed with Chronic Major Depression Recently I was rediagnosed with Cyclothymia like bipolar lite I guess which I had never even heard of My new psychiatrist said that the S S R I s I ve beem taking most of my life are like fighting fire with gasoline Shit I think this could have been avoided if I knew how to identify my symptoms and talk about the specifics of how I feel amp nbsp Anyways the main reason I m asking is because I had to bail on another social thing this weekend because I was having a can t even get out of bed to feed myself kind of day My boyfriend was concerned and a little upset that I didn t go with him He stopped by and could see that I obviously wasn t going to be able to go but assumed I was sick Like not mentally sick but the kind of sick that makes sense to people who haven t had a mental illness amp nbsp When he was asking what was wrong I was at a total loss about how to explain it to him I ve had some really intense suicidal urges lately but I ve chosen not to tell him about that for a number of reasons I ve only told my therapist and psychologist Once someone knows my dark secret it will color how they see me as a person for the rest of our relationship I don t want any of that and I also don t want people to walk on eggshells around me Also I just don t think I have the courage to say Oh I ve just had a nonstop loop of intrusive suicidal thoughts for the past months that has left me beyond exhausted and hanging on to my sanity by a thread out loud amp nbsp However feeling suicidal isn t the only thing I m feeling right now that hurts I just don t know how to explain it in a way that other people will understand or in a way that doesn t make me sound completely nuts amp nbsp When I try to put words to how a rough day with depression cyclothymic whatever the fuck i really have feels it ends up sounding really weird and vague and not something I d want to tell other people who don t get it a k a basically everyone amp nbsp It kind of feels like a constant stream of painful disgust that is welling up in my chest and neck and head The only way I can think of to describe this feeling sorry this is about to sound super weird is like imagining there are worms thousands of them churning inside my chest and throat It s beyond gross it s inside me part of me I can feel them wriggling but there is absolutely nothing I can do about them So I have two choices ignore them the best I can and distract myself somehow by getting high as fuck unconscious or sometimes games or movies will work short term or think about them and completely lose my shit because it s so confusing and horrible amp nbsp If I choose the distraction route everything gets foggy it s basically impossible to think deeply about anything I either get monkey mind and feverishly flit from one superficial thought to the next or get really dissociative and spaced out Everything aches and feels heavy moving feels like trying to walk upstream in a strong fast current I feel ugly and angry and worthless and like a genuinely bad person who needs stay hidden I want everyone to just fuck off and leave me alone because it s impossible to explain how I m feeling while I m feeling this way Not being able to convincingly tell people that I can t handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying just adds another layer of shit to deal with amp nbsp So anyway if you re willing to share I d love to hear how you describe how you feel It can be how you describe it to yourself or your therapist if you have one your friends significant other whoever Don t worry about sounding weird you might end up striking a chord with someone else or coming to a new realization if you re brutally honest I really think being able to put words to how we feel will help us feel less alone and help gain insight into our symptoms amp nbsp TL DR Words are hard especially when you re mentally emotionally whateverly compromised How do you explain how you feel,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

How on Earth do I get past this I suffer from anxiety and undiagnosed depression and I will explain more about my undiagnosed depression down below Onto my confession For a while I have been having horrible depression days and a whole bunch of suicidal thoughts My thoughts range from extremely graphic to somewhat peaceful I ve even researched the perfect ways to die and what not to do Of course I do not want to give anyone else ideas on how to end their own lives but that is just a thing that calms me down and makes me calm down and look at possible options to make it quick and painless for both me and possibly the crime scene cleaners I do live with my parents and I definitely struggle with all the questions people do not usually think of once they died I have to go away from myself and look at what others might experience Who would find the body How much of a mess would I make if I do decide to end it early What would people think afterwards Would my current image to others change due to me killing myself and having them know I was depressed How would I explain everything while still keeping a good image of myself to others How would I make it easier to help my family move on and help them grieve when they need to While I put away everything I own who should I write it for Should I clean everything so it wouldn t be a burden for others Should I place everything I own in storage boxes so they can throw out everything that they do not want or need anymore Should I record my voice and turn it into a CD saying all their names and how much I love them Or should I just end it suddenly with no explanation so they don t know how dark my mind was when I was alive I don t plan on really going through with it currently due to the questions stated earlier I would never want my mom or dad ever finding my body that would break any parent for finding their child s body Honestly I really really need help but I can t afford to ruin my current image to others I can t get help myself because I am under and I need a parent or guardian to sign off on my treatment and I don t want them to have to pay for my care I can t just tell them because they would worry and reflect on themselves to see if they did anything wrong which they did not and they would never look at me the same way after If I told my psychiatrist she would be worried about me again and tell my parents who would again worry and be stressed about me The nearest psychiatric hospital is apparently not very good and has a large history of r pe and the hospital is not very sanitary The staff are also reported as not caring or being rude to the patients My depression has been very tough on me and I am too scared to tell my psychiatrist or parents that I may need antidepressants because I again fear them not looking at me the same afterwards Also there would be several uncomfortable questions and I don t want my parents to worry about me more than they already do I have already caused enough stress for my parents with my anxiety and quiting public school and going to an online school in which I am severely behind on due to not being motivated and stressed when my parents constantly tell me to do my work and just get over it It s very stressful and I have breakdowns a lot but I do it in secret because my mom tell me that s life and suck it up I only tell my mom what s wrong with me because my dad is quite hard to talk to about mental health because he doesn t understand But my mom is starting to get at the end of her rope with me and starting to get angry if I tell her I had a panic attack or cry in front of her It definitely makes me feel closed in and I am afraid to tell her these things now because she gets frustrated with me and blames me as her defense She has a habit of blaming me as her defense mechanism and I take what she says to heart and use that to constantly critize myself I am my biggest critic and so is my mom For a time after I was diagnosed she was more gentile and showed more empathy with me but over the years since that she has became more frustrated with me I ve been lying on my schoolwork and tell her I do it when in reality I cry and sleep to get away from it all She constantly calls and texts me to see if I m doing my schoolwork and I tell her yes and I cry after the call because I am so behind and so stressed that I might have to redo my sophomore year of high school and that terrifies me I already have to go back in January and I will have to overlap some of my current schoolwork just to get enough credits for sophomore year I can t tell her this because she will get frustrated with me and most likely take my computer away which I use constantly to get the thoughts away I always have to have music or YouTube going just to not think about everything that I have to do and even then it doesn t help When I try and do the schoolwork I become overwhelmed and cry I play the sims to get away from everything and my mom is constantly telling me to do work she wants me to do school work for over hours when she s home I can t focus and I want to end it but I can t with all the liabilities I just want it to end and not be stressed about school or life,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
Suicidality came back after years of peaceHello I ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was years old I m now and self harm since I was as young as or so It comes back in different forms sometimes spontaneous attempts sometimes planned sometimes just an unbearable need to die But I wanted to ask a particular question if we re supposed to have a survival instinct as humans why on earth do I want to die all the time My therapist tells me to say I want to disappear instead of die or I want something to cease or I need a break etc But it s always quite precisely wanting to die I had a good years of barely any self harm or suicidal urges after being in CBT and I just moved countries and was recently diagnosed with PTSD after a huge breakdown and resurfacing suicidality I was just crossing the street and every bridge and rooftop was calling to me Then there was a bus coming my way I was on the sidewalk and I lost touch with reality I had no control over my body and I genuinely had no idea if I moved my body in front of the bus so it runs me over or if I was still standing on the sidewalk I opened my eyes and realized I was alive,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

I need helpBefore you get to thinking I m just some crazy person over the internet im still in highschool I ve tried finding all the outlets I could from playing sports learning guitar focusing on academics and even getting extra care from therapists counselors along with antidepressants but I feel like I can t do it anymore All the memories are too much and people are too bad for me to see the good in the world I have vivid memories of being that little kid around the ages of who was getting verbally abused by his parents and being outcasted by everyone around his age for being different I never really had friends I just remember always being by myself and it got so bad that sometimes I would just run outside and find some corner or crevice to hide in because I was so scared of the world and the kids were so fucking mean to me Public school wasn t any better I only had one friend the entire time who later would just fade off like the others and everyone would just use me for personal gain while I would get nothing in return From bullying me for my lunch lunch money to pushing me in the restrooms to having me do their work for them I was just a little bitch and those memories are so traumatic and hurt to think about to this day plus my life at home was full of seclusion trying to find a way out of all the fighting amongst the members of my family that at times did involve the choking and hitting of my siblings and even sometime me simply for just being annoying or talking when I shouldn t of I found my escape in technology and sports and really didn t develop any relationships with any of my family My brothers and sisters never even talk to me and my parents just ignore me once I get home now a days I used to wait everyday when I was just for one of my parents to come in and have a meaningful conversation with me but they would never talk to me They would just make fun of the videos I would watch on YouTube and the games I would play with my dad calling me a faggot and a loser throughout most of that stage of my life He would tell me that sometimes he wishes that I was never born so that maybe our family could ve been better Around I would pace around the halls late at night with tears in my eyes trying to build up the courage to go to the kitchen get one of the knifes and slit my wrists but I was too much of a pussy I don t know whether I regret not doing it to this day I still have to live with the painful memories and I feel like no one can understand the life that I lead and all the pain I carry with me Now that I m in highschool I ve built I large number of friends I play varsity sports I m excelling academically but I feel like my mental health is slipping My family is coming together but the memories are almost everyday the simplest thing triggers everything to come back like a wave I just feel so alone and I really just want any help I can get a lot of stuff I don t tell my closest friends about because I m afraid of them getting sick of me If anyone could reach out and just let me know I m not alone that would be greatly appreciated,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

It s my birthday in two weeksMobile Throwaway Longer than originally intended and while reading it back realised it sounds like a shit r storytime post so sorry for that I ve pretty much always felt sad for as long as I can remember Not all the time but if there were no distractions my default mood was sad Not necessarily crying my eyes out just low drained unmotivated to do anything I didn t tell anyone about how I felt because that was just normal to me Besides loads of people in their late teens early s say how depressed they are what s so special about me feeling down I worked in a pub for a year starting when I was As an antisocial introvert who finds his energy being away from people this was not a pleasant experience My girlfriend at the time was away at uni meaning between her lectures and my unsociable working hours we never got to see each other The weekend before my th birthday I worked clopens close the night open the morning in a row As I lay in bed after the final shift I felt so empty and alone and sad I accepted that this probably wasn t normal and that things needed to change I couldn t go on feeling sad all the time so I set myself an ultimatum By the time I turned I would be happy or I would be dead This seemed to relieve some of the pressure it gave me something to work towards as well as a finish line I knew it wouldn t go on forever Fast forward about and a half years I was still living at my parents house but I d left the pub and had a couple jobs in between At the time I was involved in stock management for a large national corporation which is to say I worked nights stacking shelves at a supermarket This was not my ambition I didn t really have an ambition but this wasn t it nor did I want to spend more time there than I really needed to so I was looking for other work as well I had applied for a particular job that seemed perfect for me flexible hours short commute ability to work from home if needed fast typing necessary v me on typeracer and find out all in all it felt like a good fit One day after a particularly unpleasant shift the night before I woke up to an email thanking me for my interest but that I was not going to be offered the job Not even an interview I didn t get the chance to show how well I would be able to work in the right environment All the factors that had made me so hopeful that I could get a proper job and do something that would bring me joy while earning a living at the same time gone discarded without a second look It wasn t fair But I didn t have the mental strength to deal with it there and then so I decided not to bother I went to get some dinner breakfast and was greeted by my mother usually very lovely asking all the wrong questions about money jobs my attitude just a lot of stuff that she has every right to be concerned about while I was living with my parents but absolutely the wrong time to ask I snapped at her we both said things we wish we hadn t I left and drove to a place where I could be alone and calm down After a while I went back home my parents were both very apologetic about the situation and I apologised as well I explained what had happened how I was feeling ALL of it and asked if they would help me get help I went to a GP and was diagnosed with clinical depression started on sertraline because who needs a sense of humour or sex drive to be happy Not only this but due to the length of the NHS waiting list my parents paid for me to see a private counsellor Therapy helped me talk and work through some things I d been struggling with for a while and was generally very beneficial I was able to realise that most of what was holding me back came from myself I didn t try new things or meet new people because I was worried that I wouldn t be good enough At least by not trying I d never know for certain maintaining the illusion of adequacy I so desperately needed These realisations came at a time where I ended a pretty nasty relationship came back from a session feeling very emotionally raw and was told the only way to feel better was to get a real job and to move in with her immediately and had secured an interview for a lucrative position with a clear path for progress Not only this but shortly afterwards I met someone else who is funny beautiful understanding and generally very lovely Life was good The antidepressants were stopped over the summer months and I made the decision to not carry on with them afterwards I moved out of my parents house and got a place with my new girlfriend And I got the job I had achieved everything I d wanted building a solid foundation from which the rest of my life could flourish But even now when all the distractions are put away and the world outside the window goes quiet I m still sad I lie less than a foot away from my loving girlfriend yet I m still alone I m years old and I m not happy It s my birthday in two weeks,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium
I feel like everyday is getting harder and harderNow before I say much I wanna establish that I am not clinically depressed because I ve never gone to a therapist and also I think depression is just a little too serious for me to have at the age of I wouldn t like to insult anyone actually having depression by saying that I have depression because I really don t have a reason or diagnosis to think so Anyway I ll give the short note here I was groped by a guy who worked at my house twice and I still cry about it That was years ago My ex boyfriend forced himself on me not fully but enough for me to tell him no and he wasn t listening to me I was also forcefully dragged into a dark alleyway by a friend who was at the time and kissed forcefully and also put in like a physical lock so I couldn t leave I was Plus now I m in th grade and will have to find a college soon but I don t have anh interests I can draw and everyone keeps forcing me to join fashion designing but I don t want to because I don t like it I wanted to be a singer but I cannot sing There s virtually nothing left for me I don t wanna join art or music and I have no academic or political interests That eliminates everything And I m stressed out and to the point where I would rather just die and than to face the disappointing faces of everyone when everyone is off to college and I still haven t figured it out and god knows that they don t take it very well here in India Here you HAVE to go to college after th no exceptions or going after a few years So I m pretty much ready to die Anyway those are just the things that happened to me and I felt weird typing it out to strangers so I hope nobody trolls me lol These things have taken a toll on me through the years as I didn t feel as strongly about them back then as I do now They really make me cry every night and feel disgusted in every single way But these things don t compare to the guilt I feel for what all I ve done to the people I love Well for starters I m very rude to my friends and I make cruel jokes at them They know I m joking but now I just feel bad I feel like they don t like me at all and don t want me around them Secondly I ve broken up a group of friends I had I had a very big group of guy friends years ago my boyfriend and the other guy come from this group and they were all boys and I was the only girl in the group I don t know how or why but suddenly of them had a crush on me Mind you I m not cute at all and like I said I m rude and mean so I really don t know what they saw Anyway one of them became my now ex boyfriend whom I mentioned earlier and I kind of juggled between the other and I feel horrible They eventually because of that reason got jealous and hateful of each other and the group broke up but not in a traditional way We still hung out but it was just not the same anymore Obviously I caused that by being so indecisive and mind my language hoe y Then I broke up with my then boyfriend and got with a friend who had a crush on me from the group and he is the best thing to ever happen to me We are sti together to this day and he really loves me and appreciates me I m not sure about it anymore though You see I am a horrible person and I did a horrible thing to him even though I love him the most and he is the best boyfriend ever We have a long distance relationship and that s important because we usually talk over texts and calls and meet once a month In we moved to another place and I made some friends at school I started talking to this guy as friends because he was my classmate and we chatted once in a while One day the conversation just hit the fan and got really weirdly sexual but we were joking and just laughing about it all Now I realize how weird that was and how it was cheating So anyway a few months ago J wanted my boyfriend to read a chat so I gave him my Instagram password He opened my ID read the chat and we were cool Later though naturally he checked out my ID while I checked out his He found that chat and it s weird because I had a load of conversation after that which was just normal but I don t know and why he scrolled that much into the past that he found it I guess he was already suspicious So he found it and confronted me about it in a very non confrontational way and he said he was very hurt I told him it was a joke and it can be seen in the way the friend and I were replying to each other But obviously he was upset and his trust was broken and I apologized profusely and did everything I could to make things better and eventually everything went back to normal kind of So a few days ago we were chatting as usual and I noticed that since a few days he wasn t like responding to anything sexual about me or like if I sent him a picture or a text like that I asked him and he said he can t tell me the reason but he just doesn t like to sexy anymore because it makes him mad at me I was shattered but I already knew why he was saying that Then after a few days I asked him to tell me the reason and I was right He told me it was because of that thing and I apologised and he said he understands I m not that person anymore but that he just can t do it over text otherwise it reminds him of that and he feels disgusted Understandable I was so very sad and upset and felt guilty all over again But here s the catch since a few days things have gotten somewhat better between us and he assures me that he still loves me but I know he s lying The guilt and regret just keeps on getting bigger and bigger and bigger Now I can t take it and it s not even the fact that he doesn t love me because I know why It s just the fact that I wod hurt someone like him who has helped me through everything I ve described in the second paragraph and has made me a better person the realisation that even though I did not intend to do it I sti very much cheated on my own boyfriend when I preach that cheating is the worst thing ever and the fact that no matter if he leaves me or things get better nothonf will reverse this action of mine and things and trust wi never be the same again That s the worst part it s irreversible Lately the guilt has gotten to the point where I want to die It has mixed with all the experiences and actions of mine from the past and now I don t even want to get better I just want it to end and die There s no solution I don t want a solution I just want out Nobody will care after I die because I ve successfully hurt and betrayed everyone that ever would care Nobody will miss me Nobody even likes me I don t hate my appearance as much but it s not good I don t love myself in any way because of all the things I described All I want now is either a solution as to how I can die painlessly because I m a coward or just a reverse button to everything I just typed to vent and I ve told this all to my boyfriend and he tried his best to reassure me that I m wrong and that whatever I m saying will get better but I know it won t because the only way it can get better for me or for me to make peace with it is that it never would have happened and that s impossible to do There s not way for me only out So I don t know what responses to expect from anyone if I get any that is but just Don t tell me to tell my parents as they won t listen and I don t want to share my private stuff with them as you can see this is all very weird to tell to my parents Plus my brother almost tried to kill himself last year and we are still dealing with his depression to be dealing with mine too Plus my mother is very tired and sad in her life I don t wanna make it worse for her I already do enough of that everyday by being a horrible child Don t tell me to go to a therapist as I can t without my parents and I will have to tell them then which I don t wanna and I don t want to get better as I said before because it won t change anything about my guilt If it was a trauma I wanted to recover from I could but with guilt there s not much to be done Don t suggest trivial things like go out more or talk to your friends and stuff because it doesn t help and if you know how that works you know Please don t make it any weirder than it has to be I was already embarrassed about typing this because of all the things I ve done so please don t say anything to that Don t be mean about my boyfriend or my friends or my family They re all amazing people and you re not anybody to judge them You can criticize them if there is even any criticism over the details I gave but nothing from your side as you don t know them I know all the things I listed are just teenage stuff and all that but I just needed to vent and get some support as my boyfriend didn t do a very good job because obviously he doesn t wanna talk to me anymore So yeah thanks,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Coyote in a bear trapIn September I attempted to jump a foot bridge after driving six hours to reach a bridge high enough to kill me upon impact over water I wanted to die of internal injuries less of a clean up My partner at the time cheated on me while I was in the hospital recovering and then lied to me even though he was publicly chatting with the person in question and had them plastered on all their social media I hate my state I hate the room I m in I have no room at all They put me on lithium and klonopin and the only thing it did was curb my impulse to commit suicide sleep hours a day and turn my piss orange despite all the water I was drinking I finally started taking testosterone after waiting almost five years instead having to watch my greedy motherfucker of a father die of stage cancer lest I hurt the dead s feelings After a few weeks on testosterone I had a scare in which they gave me the wrong needles retracting ones and I went to the ER with the thought I had a needle lodged into my leg On top of out of state medical bills I also have instate ones and now ones coming in for a needle that was never fucking there My insurance spiked its rates another as a big fuck you happy new year to me Luckily since I left my job after telling my boss I was suicidal and losing hours of paid time off I am now on medicaid whatever it is for young people My therapist and my psychologist don t take it though so I ve stopped taking my medications Mostly because all I fucking do is sleep It smells like absolute shit every time I leave my house and have to travel from point A to B in this god forsaken area the jobs are pathetic with pathetic pay and wouldn t give me any meaning to life except another step closer to a heart attack I feel enormously excluded from my friends ever since my transition started to show more I m not invited out anymore nobody talks to me and everyone says to just reach out but when I do I focus on them and say I m all good I would drug myself heavier and drive back out but my piece of shit car couldn t make it having been in and out of the shop more than four times in less than two months once I was out of the hospital and doing ubereats for shit pay I m filled with hate and despite all the shit I ve overcome from childhood neglect and abuse to watching my father die and not feeling shit or dropping a single tear while I watched or at his wake stalking ex s finally starting my transition I just no longer feel like it s worth it anymore I m taking up oxygen and only making the weight of the world worse Nobody wants me around except for the money I inherited I want to end it but I can t work up the guts to do it I wish there was a simpler method If I went for it again I financially and emotionally could not risk failure I want to become nothing and cease to exist I m tired of this plane I m tired of getting punched in the fucking face every time I try to open a door I m tired of being the outsider the white elephant in the room just because I m trying to be happy All it s doing is making everyone around me feel terrible and walk away despite my attempts to just be happy and encourage them because I m fucking sick of being alone I m alone now and I ve always been alone I don t foresee it changing I just need to get it off my chest because no one else will listen or rather I won t let them listen I don t want to worry them but at the same time I m trying to scream out for someone to come and help me I ve sacrificed so much for others and I ve gotten shit in return So as a coyote stuck in a bear trap do I wait for the hunter to come and kill me get attacked in some new buttfuck way by someone I decide to trust because I m so lonely or do I chew my leg off and bleed to death on my own terms I have no purpose I see no purpose Except for going to school just to probably fail like my father said I would or end up in debt up to where the noose is I hate this world There s wonderful people in it I believe a lot of people are inherently good but I m just a cancer clinging onto it,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
Well Here is my story I have been suffering from depression for years now All starting along time ago when at the ripe young age of my mom was diagnosed with cancer It was hard on me My father has a long hours job Always has Honestly I barely know the guy He did not really raise me I only ever say him hours a day in my entire childhood My brother and only sibling was physically and emotionally abusive through my childhood There is a hole the drywall where he decided to throw me into it once Once my mother passed away when I was I started failing miserably in school I dropped out of high school credit short of graduation Failed miserably at adult learning because of lack of motivation focus I was also bullied my entire childhood I have never had more then friends All of whom have become distant due to university college Shortly after my mothers death I had a psych breakdown from people bullying me about my dead mother I was admitted for a day of observation and they deemed me mentally stable Nothing was ever done about the bullies or my brother No matter who I went too My brother was just being bashful or playful and the occasional suspension was handed out to bullies but that really just delayed it for days before they came back Never had a girlfriend Iv managed to drown most of my sorrow in playing computer games rather then drugs I sought help once about a year and a half ago However my father brushed off my request for about months I felt better after talking to a psychiatrist However problematically it costs my father a session My GP also put me on some happy pills which helped for awhile but eventually in them self made me feel depressed in the only way I could be Happy was taking pills The financial burden of professional help is not something I am willing to place on my father So now I am not getting help Or taking drugs Back to square one of being miserable This has also adversly effected my lifestyle I eat between and meals a day Sleep no more then hours Finally I have begun to consider suicide as a way out I dont know Thats my jumbled mess of life experience thoughts and reasonings,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
I ve destroyed my lifeI ve destroyed my life Everything I have to live for I ve barred myself from achieving Through my own making I ve distanced myself from my few friends and family I didn t mean to upset all of these people so deeply I just want to live my life the way I want to It first started when I upset my mom and her boyfriend over something very menial but they overreacted and made my living conditions terrible which prompted me to move out I am now staying with a friend of a friend I feel like I m sponging off of her resources by staying here as long as I have already This leads into how my friends are upset with me I am no longer the happy go lucky kind of guy I used to be I m just a sad decrepit shell of my former self This all greatly escalated days ago on the st because that is when my high school had its graduation ceremony I had no way of getting there and when my mom tried getting her boyfriend to get me there I didn t only just refuse his help I openly denounced him This then turned into a huge argument over text message about me trying to hold on to my personal freedoms while he said that I was being greedy and that I robbed my mom of one of life s greatest moments I suppose it s true I have robbed my mom of what should have been one of the greatest moments of her life She has helped me immensely ever since I was young because of my autism diagnosis All of the specialists predicted that I wouldn t graduate high school I wouldn t be able to drive a car and that I d have no friends I have overcame all of those predictions and I am a very high functioning autistic person most people are surprised when they here what I am Since the start of this extreme situation for me as mentioned above I m homeless I also have lost my job and I have no car I have royally fucked myself economically and I have no way of getting out of this I d honestly be better off dead because I can t see myself digging myself out of this TL DR I ve destroyed my life Everything I once valued is gone,"Mental Distress, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium
Not SureI m going to try to be brief with this because I m gonna go to bed soon What do you do when you re uncertain about suicide I m sure a lot of us feel that way I know I do Like you think about ending it all but you don t exactly want to However you don t want to put up with the pain anger sadness anxiety and frustration that life throws at us I ve been feeling like that frequently Being in a spot where you can t change anything is really getting to me The main problem is my family and a lot things changed in the past few years I have different feelings towards some of the people I used to love and I constantly worry and fear the future The thing is I don t want to let anybody down especially my mom I m the youngest of three sisters and it ll most likely leave her heartbroken if I committed suicide I definitely don t want my mom to suffer because of me Then everything will be my fault if I left Can anyone relate to this feeling It s a tough decision I want to disappear sometimes but I m not sure if I can do it I ll be in January and I ve got a ton in front of me I m still learning and growing up yet intrusive thoughts get in the way of everything What should I do about this I am seeing a therapist in case you re wondering But I wonder about suicide and cutting myself,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

What can I do Two of my closest friends are both suicidal and I feel like there s absolutely nothing I can do about it They have both openly admitted to their situations so I suppose that s a good sign but neither of them ever want to talk about it or if they do it s only ever I m so sad or I hate myself I ve told them both over and over how much I love them and that I m there for them and they say that they trust me but nothing ever seems to come of it One who is more open is actually diagnosed with clinical depression and is on medication prescribed by her doctor but it doesn t seem to helping her at all The other is rather reserved and never wants to talk about what s going on with her I just want to help but I feel so useless These are supposed to be my best friends and I can t do anything for them I can t force them to talk to me and I can only ever see them once or twice a week So for those of you who are experienced with this type of stuff can I please get some advise,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

At war with my self sabotageHi I was diagnosed with depression years ago My abusive family didn t care about my meds so I had to be reanimated after suicide attempt as a teenager As an adult I endured being homeless twice years then a few months progressing disability sight loss suspicion of MS chronic pain and other constant lack of money selling myself for a place to live a year when I stayed in bed for days skipping showers and food I managed to finish school after years of dropping out I became homeless while still attending high school and even got accepted at uni our schools are free I did my best to follow meds and therapy plans worked on myself and my reactions tried to be more open to people After ten years of hard mental work I finally can notice and name my emotions see that not choosing is still a choice and understand how my head works All my friends say I ve changed a lot and for better Yet I have a new crisis For last year I ve been slowly ruining my education by skipping classes and not using opportunities created by pretty decent uni authorities I m stuck in therapy because I can t make any further progress until I force myself to do something change something It feels almost physical when I try to shove myself into sticking with my own plans even though they re not big ones I tried to get a part time job to get back on job hunting market but I had to quit it after damaging my sight even more Right now I m at the verge of becoming homeless again got kicked out of the uni and with no money for most meds I already asked my friends to pay some bills and meds for me and I don t want to ask too often I see how my self destructive part gains more and more power over the reasonable one however I still can see how ridiculous it is I m really afraid that after two years with no serious suicide thoughts I ll do something irreversible I also get urges to cut my arms which I hadn t done for almost years I feel safer when doing nothing even though I know it s way more dangerous Today I cried in the middle of street because I can t take this amount of stress anymore How does one force themselves to act How to motivate yourself to fight I m sure I want to live but I m also sure I m not able to live this way anymore Suicide seems like bad decision but the only one which can give me some peace I see it like a tooth removal you don t want to get rid of your teeth but it s so damaged it s the only way to get rid of pain,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Im transHonestly I ve had mental health issues since I was very young it s not something I ve had diagnosed but the anxiety I feel when doing menial things like going outisde or being unable to talk on the phone is something I ve been feeling for longer than I can remember Now that I m older I ve also learned that my family has a history of mental health issues my brother has a personality disorder and struggled with self harm my dad has an anxiety disorder and has substance abuse problems and my auntie had serious substance abuse issues throughout her early adult life because she was trying to kill herself so really it feels like I ve been setup to feel like this In high school when I was I started self harming and at I tried to kill myself No one knew about the suicide except for a then close friend However the school had noticed my behaviour and my mum was called and I was assigned a councillor I went twice and quit and no one ever followed up on it Even my mum just told me I was being stupid This was also a time where both my best friends ghosted me and I never spoke to them again specifically because of the self harming Fast forward to and I m having identity problems and sexuality issues which puts a strain on my relationship with my ex We break up and years later I come out to my family and friends as transgender and my mum is just fine with it But no matter how many times I beg her to help me she refuses and won t take me to the doctor s I m and I essentially run away I ve lost all my friends where I live my dad is a waster and my mother refuses to help me So I move to England where some of my internet work friends live and life is good for a while It starts again I have arguments or just mood swings and I start cutting again It s pretty obvious because my wrists are covered and my flat mates do nothing no conversations or anything They just don t care I ve begged my close friend here to take me to the doctor s I ve even offered him money but he also refuses despite the fact I am literally mutilating myself in our flat Ive even asked what GP doctor s to go to because I don t know how it works but they don t even reply to me Tldr My old friends all left me the school didn t care my dad wasn t even in my life my mum doesn t want to help and my new friends couldn t care less And it seems soo silly but I just can t do it myself and I need someone right now but no one cares It doesn t matter what I do no one fucking cares enough to help not even my mum I don t even know what to do now it s like maybe if I killed myself it would just be easier It fucking sucks being trans and it fucking sucks being anxious about everything in life,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Could anyone give me advice I ve had psychological problems for as long as I can remember and I ve reached out for help so many times but no matter what I do nothing changes The first few times I asked for help I told my parent I was depressed This was when I was barely a teenager and she just did the normal parent thing of saying What do you have to be depressed about Then a few years later I started self harming and not attending school My school made me see a psychologist for low attendance but they said I was fine My Mother told them about my self harming which I m sure they already knew about if and this psychologist said it s just trendy and that her son does it because he s a Goth Those words makes me cringe to this day My Mother took me to my GP anyway and they refused me to refer me to any mental health service and gave me a leaflet for a mental health service of which I was not within the age range I later dropped out of school I started drinking to deal with it then having strange symptoms derealisation depersonalisation I was having panic attacks multiple times everyday and completely socially isolates myself for a few years I felt terrible all the time and was deeply disturbed by my thoughts When things got a little better I decided to go back to school as I had no qualifications and went on to study a course which could get me into University studying a science related degree I found the work stupidly easy and went through with good grades By the time I was on my last year my mental health was deteriorating quickly I could no longer concentrate or function at school or in any other area of my life I went to my GP and they asked me some irrelevant questions about my Father none about my symptoms apart from weight loss gain and sleep Then refused to give me SSRI s I went home and some time later my memory is a blur I tried to kill myself I ve now had two serious attempts at taking my life and I m positive there s no way for me to get help but if I don t get help soon I know I m going to try again And I know it will likely work this time I ve tried to get help so many times I can t even leave my house anymore I don t know what to do Nobody is taking me seriously and I have no idea what s wrong with me How can I get help I ve even tried reaching out to people working in the NHS Nothing comes of it I have people who depend on me and I don t want to put my potential to waste but I m running out of time and I ve tried everything I can I don t even have the emotional energy anymore I m not scared of dying and the idea is quite appealing to me regardless of my mental state so if it happens it happens I have multiple mental health problems as well as sensory processing problems relating to a neurodevelopment disorder I have and just existing is torture to me Even when my mental health is okay I want the suffering to end I m so so tired I just need to know that I tried for the people I care about and my own philosophical reasons And I would do anything in my power to turn this situation around If anyone can offer any advice to me then please leave a comment Anything you have to say will be helpful to me,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

I can t pretend anymore tl dr my roommate is an asshole who is no longer content with the agreement we made when I moved in with him keeps threatening to ship me back to my abusive mother who I moved in with him to get away from in the first place and instead of telling me something as important as our financial aid got cut off last night when it happened waited until we were fighting this morning to yell it at me and then blame me because of all the stress he s under And it s making me feel like actually killing myself for the first time in over a decade The long version I m clearly not wanted here I told him point blank when I moved in that I have several diagnosis that label me disabled both physically and mentally and I ve applied for disability twice only to be denied and don t have the funds now to try a third time I told him that I cannot work a regular job so unless he was willing to put his social network here to use since I don t have one and help me find something I wouldn t be able to work We made the agreement that I d be a live in maid and I said hell yeah and have been keeping up my end of the deal ever since But in these past months he s clearly grown tired of that He says my disabilities are an excuse for me to be lazy He says I could work if I tried but he hasn t been in my shoes The last retail positions I held led to a repeated mental breakdowns in the middle of the store during my shift for things like a customer yelling at me or a co worker being rude and b so much pain that I literally came home cried myself to sleep woke up enough to shower and eat and then go back to work and rinse repeat The short time I had those jobs I was miserable I led a miserable existence and actually contemplated suicide for the first time since about years earlier when I had actually seriously tried twice in a row On top of that I was pretty much given the diagnosis of hey yeah those mental breakdowns are bad for your mental health they worsen my anxiety and depression and oh that pain in your legs and feet means you re over stretching something and if you keep doing that you might end up in a wheelchair forever so no jobs like that if you care about your health But this is my fault right I m giving out excuses I m lazy I deserve to go back to the mother who verbally mentally and emotionally abused me for over years of my life and who according to at least separate therapists I saw is likely the cause of my anxiety and depression in the first place and whose actions caused me to try to kill myself twice in the past I deserve to go back to her even though she made it plain to me that if my roommate ever saw fit to do that I d be homeless because she would bring me home only to kick me out again because she s not supporting me all my life Or maybe I deserve to go into that bathroom in the room next to me lock the door and run a bath in the tub and try again After all my roommate could move back in with his parents if he didn t have to worry about me since they won t take me in too I wouldn t be holding him back anymore like he says all the time I d be one less expense he has to pay and hell maybe he could even sell my stuff for a decent amount and that d buy him enough time to find a job and all that Just like my mom he d be better off I wasn t dragging him down all the time,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

with a single viable solution so i will try to post this somewhere for someone to read maybe even care Story Suicide and depression have always been in my blood my father hanged himself when i was just and my big brother jumped in front of a train when i was It s important for me to say that i have had a good life my youth was not a place of depression or despair at all I had friends girls and i did really well in high school despite almost no attempt I had a quirk however that still destroys me to this day i have this tendency to push people away in a very dramatic way when they get to close That naturally do mean that i speak to noone from my high school days or even before the majority have explicit hate towards me Anyway the story of how i am where i am today During studying for my B Sc https B sc i got a relevant part time job on the side and i absolutely hated every minute of it I made the choice to finish my degree and basicly take extra cources regarding topics that cought my interest and i could ses myself pursueing a career in Since my B Sc https B Sc is in economics and business administration i had the opportunity to influence it to a certain degree Fast forward to when i completed my B Sc https B Sc I was incredibly lucky to get enrolled into exactly the master s degree i had intented on top of that i met the girl of my dreams Everything was lining up perfectly and the plan was made Study like a madman spend time with the girl and apply for relevant part time jobs or internships rince and repeat every day And i did However my grades were going down the drain and despite several interviews i did not get any job months into my Masters my self esteem is non existent and its taking a toll on my relationsship Since my GF would never even think of leaving me at the time she was always a bubbly person and her life was progressing quickly for the better she put things on hold to help me get up again This were something i could not live with i have no intention of holding anyone back or make their life a compromise so i decided to leave her I still remember the last thing i said to her at the time This is the biggest mistake i have ever made in my life Fast forward months things are going even worse i completely realize that soon have a close to worthless degree and cant get a job and i am ashamed to even see my friends who s lifes are lining up perfectly However one day a hear a silent knock on my front door Its my now Ex girlfriend with tears in her eyes she tells me she loves me and i am the only one she ever wants to be with i tell her i love her first time i ever told anyone We get back together The next months are horrible i start seing a psychotherapist without my girl knowing I am diagnosed with depression anxiety and sleep deprivation I get medication for all of it For some reason every second is pure agony to me and i eventually plan my own suicide January By November I decide to leave my now ex girl to lessen the blow of me passing away Going all november and december planning my suicide while doing my exams I somehow decide the give life another chance It s hard to explain but people around you can sense when you doing horrible i got random message from friends telling me i was a good guy and other encouriging words out of the blue despite no one knowing of my condition New years eve i get a long text from my ex girlfriend that she loved me she will never forget me that we might me some where down the line in a better place One week after i decide to go to her place just the way she did for me in hopes of a sweet reunion However things go really dark She is home with another guy She s angry at me she s says she hates me She tells me that she called the cops Right after she deletes and blocks me from any form of contact and social media One month later she s engaged to this succesful rich and handsome guy seemingly as happy as she wll ever be She loved me until she found something better The months after are tough i plan another date for my suicide July I continue to write my masters thesis and try to meet new people I just delivered my master thesis its horrible final nail in the coffin for my GPA I managed to get no part time jobs or internships despite applications during my studies I have applied for close to full time jobs the last months No interviews The girl of my dreams are getting married to a guy who is everything i tried to be but could not By October i will be out on the streets with nothing but debt My friends are doing well and i am ashamed to see them I once heard someone say that suicide is only a viable option when there is no hope for a better future I believe there isn t Even if i get a job to scrape by I will have to live a miserable lonely live because of the decisions i made I dont believe i can I still want to emphasize that i have had a good life However i do not believe there are any more happy moments for me Spoiled i know Sorry for not so well written english and the wall of text I expect nothing but it certaintly does not hurt to write it out,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Could this be considered an attempt I ll begin with that I am not currently depressed anxious nor receiving any kind of treatment However I often find myself reflecting on an event that took place about eight years ago At the time I was diagnosed having an anxiety disorder and likely depression Though I m not a physician I was reluctant to accept the doctors diagnoses of depression but having had a prior bout with anxiety I began treatment for both In time and under medical supervision I was eventually permitted to cease treatment Some time later I went though a period of limited and difficult sleep Sleep has been an issue for me since early adolescence One night after about hours of sleeplessness I had become so desperate and exhausted that all I wanted all I could think about was sleeping I took a handful of pills muscle relaxers a couple of different narcotic pain killers and diphenhydramine Probably around pills total washed down with about half bottle of liquor The drowsy feeling I had been seeking was upon me in short order Before surrendering to sleep a though crossed my mind It may have been too many pills to much liquor I had my phone by my bed and two flatmates within earshot I didn t care I just wanted to sleep and soon I would be I awoke about a day later with evidence that I had pissed myself sometime during my drug enabled sleep I did not actively seek to end my life however for that brief moment before surrendering to sleep I was honestly indifferent about ever waking up I ve not since found myself in such circumstances and have been mostly happy for the greater part of the past decade but I often think about that night and wonder how to classify it I ve never spoken to anyone about it and this is the first time it has even been externalized put to paper computer screen TLDR Couldn t sleep Took a lot of pills and booze Before passing out honestly thought it may have been too much but I didn t care Help was readily available just needed to shout for one of my mates thin walls or could have used the phone sitting right next to me Wasn t trying to kill myself but I didn t care if I never woke up,"Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

what can I do to help my friend my friend has been struggling with suicidal thoughts for years and has tried to kill himself at least twice that he s told me of he has a lot of financial stress his family took him to an inpatient care thing once and the hospital kept him there for days and charged him him a huge bill that he can t pay and his family won t help him besides this he has just had a really really terrible hard life and struggles with mental illness as well I feel so bad for him but whenever he vents to me I don t know what to say I want to make sure I am being as supportive as possible I know there s probably nothing I can do to help but I don t want to do anything wrong or not good enough i m just really scared for him His mom has to get an abortion recently and today he told me he feels jealous of it because he wasn t aborted Things he says to me are terrifying He is such a wonderful caring talented person with so much ambition and he has so much good to offer the world mostly i just let him vent at me when he s upset but all I can ever think of to say is yes that is really horrible I m so so sorry you feel that way and i hope things get better I wish I could help you I feel like this is such a stupid and generic thing to say but I don t know what else to do I am not good at speaking and i don t have a lot of life experience so it s hard for me to talk to him and relate to him sometimes but i just want to make sure I am not doing anything wrong I try to reassure him sometimes that when he gets insurance from his work soon and can see a therapist things will get better but I really don t know he has the means to kill himself whenever he wants he takes medication that requires needles so he has those around it s scary,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

I feel empty I ve got nothing leftI ve been suffering from depression for a couple of months now It sort of came out of nowhere It made no sense at the time because everything in my life was wonderful and happy and I had no reason to be so miserable Slowly it began destroying everything I tried an SSRI but it made things significantly worse Throughout it all my boyfriend supported me It was so hard for us and it challenged us so much but he stuck by me I told him everything and he supported us throughout Yesterday after what had been a brilliant couple of days he broke up with me We always kept having silly little arguments I know they were triggered by how stressful everything had been because of me but for the most part we had been having such good times and being so good to each other I tried to get him to stay but he wouldn t he d made up his mind I waited until I was in a more sane mood and sent him a long email telling him everything that I felt I know he read it but he hasn t replied I won t send him another I know I shouldn t have done that in the first place I ve tried everything I can think of I ve got anxieties out of nowhere All I can think about is the fact that I need him and that I m nothing without him I spent years in university to qualify for a job that I hate This morning I got an email from a new course that I wanted to start telling me my qualifications were enough that I could do a conversion course Only I can t because since then I got diagnosed with severe depression and it s one of those careers where a history of depression is enough that you re unable to do it And I just want to tell my ex about this and share with him but I can t I know I can t contact him again I ve tried everything I can think of but I can t pull myself out of this I have the stupid irrational sadness from depression and now the logical sadness from this It s all building up so much He was never completely my life I still had friends I ve texted fifteen people One has agreed to meet over the weekend The others are all busy with their own things It s fair enough I ve tried getting out and doing things but it s just no hope I m not improving I m getting worse I no longer know what to do I can t keep going like this,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress",Medium

I think I m done with life My depression has been raging over the last few months and I hinged everything on a doctor s appointment that I had today I ve had unsightly chest back acne since I was And I ve been to doctors tons of times for treatment oral antibiotics and a myriad of topical gels Of course here I am years later and not a single one of those treatments helped In january I decided that I d make one last bid for treatment I d go to my doctor and insist on accutane Despite the side effects It seems to have a high success rate for treatment resistant acne And I d rather have months of pure hell with an outcome where I can look in a mirror and not hate myself than live even another day as I am now knowing that I ll always be self conscious about my body and hate myself everytime I look in a mirror Now of course because I m an American And our healthcare system fucking blows I couldn t actually see a doctor for this until a month and half later Where I show the Dr my skin explain how long I ve been suffering and how miserable I feel looking at it I express my desire to go on Accutane And of course he immediately shuts that down Instead deciding in his infinite ignorance that the solution was to give me a combination of two topical gels Ones I had already tried separately with no fucking improvement This of course tanks my mood to the point of basically shutting down communication All I can think of is how I want to die and this fuckwad doctor wants to jerk me around with a worthless treatment He then prods me about why I m suddenly so morose and I lose my shit tell him how my bad skin is one of the confidence destroying things in my life that I fucking hate myself and break down in the room But instead of being helpful he uses it as a reason to start trying to throw psych meds at me This is what I get for trying to improve my life So why the fuck should I even bother living anymore,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Do people with lived experience of suicide attempts make a difference for people who are suicidal As a person with ideation and previous attempts I know that people who could relate to my pain helped me to feel less alone and more connected Sometimes they came off as self serving and not really caring about anyone but themselves Sometimes a bit condescending as well What s your experience with this Have you ever talked to someone who was not part of the system that has lived experience Was it helpful Did it help with self stigma did anyone like this talk to the family to help them understand and be supportive,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
Paranoid verbally abused heart racing racing thoughts I have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder That basically means that I sometimes have problems controlling my mood or my way of thinking isn t aligned with reality sometimes So I was invited to dinner with my family for Passover and everything was all fine and dandy Then everyone left and we said our goodbyes I helped my mom with the table and some other cleaning around the kitchen I asked if she needed anymore help and she said no In response I asked if I could use the upstairs massage chair and she said ok So I went upstairs unbothered for about minutes to use the chair Keep in mind that I wasn t bothering anyone and was minding my own business No harm no foul The chair has a timer on it so that I know how much time remains At around minutes left my mom s husband stepfather whatever you want to call it comes upstairs to switch it off and he starts to belittle me with his words how this is his house and that I need his permission to use it So I left and walked downstairs away from him but he just wouldn t shut up like a broken record I went to the kitchen and followed soon after I asked mom if she needed some help and NOW she said that her husband helped her out AFTER she specifically told me that she didn t need anymore help Then I continued to distance myself from him and still no talking He s like You can be seen but not heard I understand if a grown up tells that to a child but I m here Don t I have a right to defend myself if I am being verbally or physically abused even if it means expressing my point of view with a shaky voice I told him ENOUGH but he still continues to talk I m not a little kid I got the point minutes ago and he still gabbers on and on and on Then I go upstairs to the second floor of the house to get my belongings and leave But he prevents me by blocking the doorway and still rambles on I m telling you he REALLY knows how to piss someone off Then after I grab my things and head toward the door he has the audacity to extend his hand to say bye All I do is walk past him put on my slippers and leave on my bicycle In the middle of all the arguments and the created tension my mom continued to defend him Like WTF I didn t do anything to anybody and if he didn t want me to use it he should have said so from the get go So I m seriously going to consider an ultimatum either mom divorces him or I will follow through with my suicide I just can t continue to live in fear like this I thought he would change but I was just being delusional Last time I checked it was also my mom s house and she has lived there longer than he has He moved in with her back in but she has lived there for over years stretching way back into the s I m telling you right now if I don t commit suicide my paranoid thoughts will lead me to believe that he will come to my apartment and threaten to kill me I am only miles away from where they live because my mom helped me with an apartment close to her I guess for protection He can at any time take the card to the community open the door to the building and unlock my front door The problem with him is that he likes to pursue things till the very end It s always one sided in his case I don t say anything but he just talks and talks to no end The things he does to empower himself is really sick and I m the one with the disorder Never ending verbal abuse and condescending tone with him I am seriously considering filing a restraining order against him I have never filed a restraining order against anyone but he might be the first The problem is it takes time to make it official and the decision is tentative because they have to hear out not only my side of the story but his as well I m worried that the court might take his side over mine and revoke my attempt to issue the restraining order I don t want to wait to be physically injured to use that as evidence to justify my support for the restraining order He might be married to my mom and live in the same household as her but that doesn t give him the right to treat me the way he does And who knows how he treats my mom behind closed doors I m know I m repeating myself but it has to be said I know I was a guest in my mom s home but I m no stranger and I wasn t disturbing anybody If anything it was like my presence wasn t even in the house until you actually came into the room That s how quiet I was Typing some of this out in writing in my quiet apartment has helped calm my mood a little bit but I am still feeling highly anxious about the situation I don t provoke anyone and I mind my own business Don t start nothing and there won t be nothing I live by that motto P S I flipped him the bird yesterday while I was trying on new clothes after he told me to suck it in It s not just HOW he said it but the WAY he said it with a smug look on his face and arrogant tone He was obviously referring to my stomach I have body fat and I have a flat stomach with a little bit of fat around the sides but not much abs Regardless he just HAS to talk shit just to feel better about himself The things he does to

A NoteI ve dealt with depression for at least years now I tried everything I could on my own to feel better eating well working out good sleep schedule etc Nothing worked I was in a type of medical school for a year and dropped out because I hated everything so much I now switched to computer science I definitely enjoy it more and I was hoping things would get better for me but I m still so unhappy It took me years to finally ask for help and see a doctor as I didn t want to worry my parents about it But finally I did a few months ago I saw my doctor and started an anti depressant Lexapro I was so so hopeful that this would help me but unfortunately things only got worse and worse These past months have been the absolute worst months of my life I m failing classes because I missed so many lectures assignments I have no money no job I ve isolated myself so much I just feel like I can t do anything I now feel as if I ve exhausted almost all my options for help and I just don t know what I can do anymore I have no desire to be in this world anymore I feel like I m just not cut out for it and I m okay with that There s so many other people out there my life is so small and meaningless anyway so what s it matter It sadly doesn t seem like it s worth all the trouble anymore And so many people have depression nowadays it s so sad I just fucking hate it here The only thing keeping me around is the pain that I know I will cause my friends and family if I do end things I wish it were acceptable to just make the choice yourself to give up and leave Well if anyone actually read this thanks I ve been really wanting to tell someone close to me how I ve been feeling but I feel like I can t put all this weight on their shoulders And honestly I do believe things could get at least somewhat better if I kept trying But I don t think I even have the desire to do that anymore It doesn t seem worth it I just want out I feel like such a disappointment to everyone and I m so sorry to everyone I ve let down I feel so bad for being such a financial and emotional burden on my parents I m so sorry mom and dad I don t think I can take it much longer,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Male Epileptic and Unemployablenot sure what to really say I just need somewhere i can say this without freaking someone out Im just a failure at life overall i gave it my best and my best just wasnt good enough I come from a crappy little no horse town in Southern WV I was always the smart kid and never really fit in there though Mom was a hippie and everyone thought she was a witch its a very small and backwards place and my having seizures as a child only made that speculation and harassment worse Thought i would go off to college and make something of myself but it didnt really work out that way several years ago I quit school and moved back in with my parents after a long illness they passed away mom then dad just under a year later After that I moved to a city looking to start over and find work but i have Temporal lobe epilepsy making me an unemployable waste looking for a job with epilepsy is completely fucking pointless from wikipedia Stigma alone can make it more difficult for people with epilepsy to find jobs Even if one s seizures are fully controlled by medication or if the condition has been completely cured by surgery many employers are reluctant to hire a person with epilepsy they have a gift for understatement and more importantly In the United States while the Americans with Disabilities Act does not fully protect persons with epilepsy from discrimination in hiring practices the Social Security Administration only considers people with epilepsy disabled and thereby eligible to receive benefits if the condition severely limits one or more major life activities Employment may be hard to find or perform for many people with epilepsy but not all are eligible for government sponsored disability payments so we re not protected by the ADA AND not disabled for purpose of receiving disability benefits how they can say I m too disabled to drive and somehow still not disabled is a farce and although I m not required to disclose not having the licence is an immediate give away and they ALWAYS ask no matter what the law says if I lie about the reason and they find anti seizure drugs in pre employment drug screening which they always do OR I slip up and have one at work they fire me for lying on tha application and if i dont lie I never get hired in the first place and they make up or don t disclose the reason or like the amusement park they give me a letter that no doctor will sign and they KNOW no doctor will sign absolving them of any responsibility I m tired of bullshit like that receptionist at the Dr Geiger s dentist i tried to go to still havent gotten any dental care at all a year later office running me off after he refused to treat me I had money he just refused to treat an epileptic shouldn t have been honest on the any medications part then his nurse said people like me shouldn t be allowed in public around normal people or the horrified looks best case or threats and harassment from strangers if I DARE to have so much as a tic in public I just dont want to be a burden my sisters simply cannot afford to keep me up indefinitely and i hate how im just never going to be able to have a life no wonder the women ive been with have been physically abusive im fucking pathetic if i didnt live in the first world id never have even survived to adulthood hell maybe everyone in mingo who said i was some kind of demonspawn were right i dont even know anymore now i cant even get away in my sleep having awful nightmares about being beaten and humilaited everytime I sleep ive got to end this i dont have another choice I m tired of feeling humiliated depressed and hopeless I m unemployable and in America that apparently means you are unfit to live some people will be thrilled to see me go glad that another useless eater gone and those that are saddened will be better off economically whether they realize it or not i m so sorry i was such a failure i tried just wasnt good enough,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium
I can t do this anymoreI can t do this anymore I apologize in advance for the long post It started in my freshman year of college I had to drop out because I couldn t adjust to being at a major university not making friends and dealing with college level work I had a mental breakdown and had to see a therapist and physiatrist I was put on Zoloft and another medicine I can t remember That was December of for the first few months of I was a shut in I didn t do anything but stay in bed I found my dads gun but I was too scared to do anything with it I was scared it would misfire and hurt me and not kill me Eventually I began to interact more with friend that were home they didn t go off to school they stayed at community college and then planned on going to university I began to hang with them like old times during high school and got confidence in myself again I started working out on a regular basis again and felt good Throughout the summer of I was making friends and partying staying out late and not taking the medicine prescribed to me because I felt good without it I was smoking weed heavily and ended up losing my virginity while high to a girl I didn t even know on some random day This started a whole downward slope My car began to have issues because I was hanging out with a lot of girls I was considered a fuckboy and the one girl that I had gotten my first kiss from wouldn t date me because of that reason and because her dad is racist I began owing people money and couldn t pay them back because I lost my job I was high one day while my friends were playing basketball and decided to take my friends keys and drive to get something to eat without telling him I posted a girls nudes in our friend group message which led to me being kicked out While all of this was happening I was being recruited to the navy I had stopped smoking to join but I was losing a lot of friends My parents caught me smoking and sent me to a mental hospital It was around the time Mac Miller died Late I was still feeling good because I had something to look forward to joining the navy But soon the thoughts of depression came back after failed hookup attempts with girls I have to this day never had a actual girlfriend I joined the navy in early and made it to the last few weeks of boot camp Where then I failed the fitness test by not keeping my pace running I was sent back in training Which meant I had to do another weeks on top of the I had already been there This took a toll on me I became delusional and because of unfortunate circumstances on the base I was sent to another group The group was for health reasons related to a person who died and they wanted all the people with this condition to stay there until cleared to return All this group did was complain which bothered me even more I had a breakdown and was sent to a physiatrist to be separated from the navy I was still delusional and thought I was going to be in the navy I ended up getting sent to the mental hospital where I spent months before going home When I came home it was the summer of I saw a new physiatrist and it took me a few weeks to realize I wasn t going back to the navy When I realized that I began to spiral I began to constantly eat fast food I stopped working out I got fired after months at my job Throughout I ve gained a lot of weight my hair has began to thin and fall out I ve began to think about suicide I just have had enough I don t have the ability to feel better I have no friends no relationship to look to,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
So why continue Ever since middle school I have wanted to commit suicide It s not gotten better I am in my final stretch of school at college I just want to end it My logic has shifted from I hate myself because I am an awful person who doesn t deserve to live to what s the point of living I figured it out I am just like everyone else We all have problems and we all have things we are good at and bad at That s fine There s no reason why I should hate myself But I do Every action I take causes me more sadness then happiness And the happiness I do attain never lasts more than a few days I ve tried medication and it makes everything worse Much worse What s the point of continuing on if the moments of happiness in life are drowned out by the sadness I feel of every day life I come into the world alone I go out alone I have a loving family amp caring friends I ve a bright future and I have almost a hundred grand to my name without so much as raising a finger to attain it I can t enjoy any of that Instead I focus on the fact that I can t enjoy it I focus on everything I do that s wrong regrettable past actions and why must I be hurtful towards anything I care about even if it s in jest I can be one of the nicest people and that s fine In fact I like making people happy because since I can t enjoy being happy at least I can window shop and watch your happiness What s the point of carrying on though It s as if everything I eat turns to ash The only reason I ve not killed myself just yet is because it s selfish and hurtful towards the people I care about I had a fairly disturbing thought process recently You always go out of your way for others Do something for yourself something you ve wanted since middle school Kill yourself I realize now that my preferred method for selfinflicted death is gunshot to the head Anything else would give me too much of a hesitation I have plenty to live for I don t want too I spend too much effort trying to accomplish my goals for things could make me happy I m tired of trying to be happy and failing constantly I can t make a moment of happiness last when I have an ocean of painful things to remember or harp on Even if it s not from that ocean I can look at other perspectives of my life and be disappointed in myself Ignoring the introspective causes of depression in my life another source is the complete meaningless of my life I work semi hard to attain certain goals and values and once completed the joy is rather limited but still existent However I am tired I am tired of work at the age of The rest of my life will be filled with nothing but work till I retire Wake up work sleep Repeat Why That s such a mind numbing task to endure for the rest of my for see able future It s definitely not something to look forward too I don t want to be alive if I am going to be forced to work for the rest of my life Fun fact I ve been commited to the hospital for self harm in fifth grade and have attempted suicide four times my last attempt being senior of highschool I used to cut myself I ve been put on antidepressants three times all with no real effect I was offered to moderate this place a while back I said no because this was gonna be hard to tell other people you should be alive when I didn t want to Of course the reason I gave MWM for my decline was that this place was far too depressing TL DR The emotions caused by the negatives of life outweigh the emotions by the positive So why carry on I want to stop putting effort into being alive It s far too much work and appears to have little to no pay off,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Might as well post my story here My troubles started late last year At around the time I was starting work an ex employee came on to the property and started shooting people He would end up killing one injuring then killing himself I never heard any of the shots I never saw people running I only heard on my walkie talkie Call shots fired I couldn t believe it I looked at my coworker he looked at me and we got moving He got people in one direction I went in the other and we started letting people know that we had to get to safety We all gathered in the designated emergency safe zone and for the next few hours we would be there wondering what was going on Wondering what happens next Wondering if we d be found by the police or the gunman We didn t know he killed himself soon after it started We didn t know if this was some crazy guy or a terrorist attack We didn t know if he was alone But for hours we sat in that room And for hours we would know only the fear of the unknown This was the second time in my life I d been through this The first was in high school My senior year This time however noone would be hurt I have always been thankful for that fact I don t know much of the details of that shooting only what I heard from the people that were in the cafeteria that day What I heard was this A male student angry about a breakup came into school with a gun to kill his ex He got things started by firing into the ceiling of the cafeteria He fired a shot from his semi automatic and gun Then he pulled the slide back and fired into the ceiling again Then he pulled the slide back on more aimed the gun at his ex and pulled the trigger His gun jammed No bullet came out He dropped the gun and ran He made it a few blocks before being tackled to the ground by the French teacher For a long time I ve been thankful that this guy didn t actually know how a handgun was supposed to work I know all this now At the time it was just like when it happened on the job For hours we huddled around the class no idea that it was over No idea that no one had actually been hurt Just the knowledge that someone came into the school and started shooting and the fear that we would be found by a gunman rather than police That fear then only affected me for a few weeks Returning to normal would be a short process then I don t even remember much besides not going to school the next day This time has been different This time the fear has had a profound effect on me that I simply haven t been able to shake I find myself thinking about it all the time Being in that place of fear and ignorance of what would come to pass And the unshakable feeling of worthlessness that comes from feeling this way despite never having been in actual danger I was never in the same room as the gunman in either time I wasn t close enough to even hear the shots But I still fear these events happening again I imagine most people won t ever go through what I ve been through once in there life let alone twice At least not in civilian life But all I can feel is that there will be a third for me It feels like an inevitability that I will find myself in that situation again But I feel like the third will be the last It s given me this sense of an invisible clock on my life One I can feel but not see or read One that says I will be murdered in a random act of violence and not of old age peacefully I m not alone completely though My wife was in that same high school My wife knows the fear of being there wondering what happens next Wondering if anyone got hurt If I got hurt And she knows the fear of wondering if I d make it home that day Sometimes I feel like shes the only one that really gets it I wish this were my only problem The fear soon turned into depression Depression is something I know I m familiar with the desire to simple stop existing I know the pain that comes from wishing to God that life would just end for me so that my loved ones could cope with my loss rather than my commitment The shame of these thoughts is something that I ve dealt with on and off for a decade now What s new to me is this horrifying feeling of rage and hatred that the depression seems to have manifested into I hate every single human alive right now Myself more than any I hate myself for the hatred that I feel towards you reading this right now The hatred I feel towards my neighbors and co workers Toward my own family These are the feelings that scare me more than anything I feel them every night as I try to sleep These horrifying thoughts make it difficult to sleep I ve never been an angry person But now it s something that I feel so much of I m losing sleep over it and I feel that s making things so much worse The last issue I m going to mention is a drug I m taking It s a drug called methotrexate I started taking it in December It has some pretty bad side effects for some people Some people take it with very little side effect I take the drug once a week on Saturdays When I take the drug I feel nausea abdominal pain head aches and ridiculous levels of fatigue I usually sleep around hours on Saturday because of the fatigue I think beyond these the drug may be affecting me psychologically I don t know how to verify besides by not taking the drug today If that s all I have to do to go back to normal then that s what I ll do I m just scared that won t be enough I started therapy in January He was quick to diagnose PTSD but no method of treatment has been offered yet I know these things take time though He also recommended coming off the medication After writing all this I don t even know what to expect people to say Generic Just hang in there bro I don t know Maybe some one else I can talk to would be helpful I feel a little better having written all this out like I could go to sleep without rage I scare myself lately In this moment I don t want to hurt anyone I feel like I should take myself out while I m like this so I don t hurt anyone else I m scared of getting locked away in a ward too The loss of wages alone would be devastating I don t think anything good would come of that I don t want to put my wife through that I just want help I m scared of help but I know that s what I need I just don t know where to really get it from I m so scared of you reading this finding out who I am and reporting me as dangerous That my life will be ruined because I sought help But I can t let fear stop me or I will die and it may not be alone It s that simple But I m still so scared right now,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping,

My Girlfriend Tried to Commit Suicide Today I m Not Supposed to Talk to Her Anymore I Need Help Long one guys but I m fucking shaking I have no one to talk to about this I started Dating Aly about a year ago Found her on tinder Turned out we went to the same middle school yada yada Aly has kids with the same father I am the father of a nearly year old We are both yrs old When we started dating she told me about her past Let s just say she hasn t had it easy Father committed suicide A failed marriage Etc I m also not in the best place right now My own custody battle is a story of its own and it s as bad as you can imagine Like that YT video of the lady fighting with the kids father about their haircut type of bad Since my son was born I decided to turn my life around Become more responsible get a degree yada yada I m actually proud to say that I ve already gotten an associate s degree bought a house been promoted It s not all been smooth But I m starting to see the changes I set out to make But I m way far from where I would like to be Not done by a long shot I literally see my son days out of the month and it fucking kills me It feels like torture Slow painful torture So anyways Aly s place was just down the street from mine So she would be over all the time and eventually her kids too So six months later she asked to move in I immediately raised some flags Reminded her about my situation with my kid going to school hour long weeks getting home at PM and working on the computer until AM I told her I had lived on my own since I left my parents and I literally didn t even know how to coexist with another human being She said she understood and it didn t matter She was also paying a month for rent and spending half the time at my place so from a financial perspective it did make sense So I reluctantly agreed Aly is amazing And I mean amazing She would like do everything around my house even though I would beg her not to She fucking loves my kid so much And it s genuine When he was diagnosed with autism she started researching got some type of autism therapy degree and just overall looks after him like if it was her own I ll go as far as to say that Aly is by far a better mom to my son that his actual give the kid an iPad and ignore him for the whole night evil spirited ass shitty excuse for a mother mother God I hate her So fast forward months and Aly has completely changed Lost extreme weight Taking prescription pills this palpable sadness always in her stare I know what s up immediately Because she told me She wanted more She wanted a baby with me She wanted me to say I love you back when she said it she wanted me to text her more take ker out more often Travel You know the little things And you know what She was right to want all those things She deserved them She had life throw every single bad scenario at her and she still turned out amazing Raised amazing kids Helped me with everything Hell yeah she deserved every single thing she asked for and much more I decided to be blunt it s hard for me to say no and I often commit to things that I know I don t want or can t do and I told her that at least for the time being Nothing about our relationship was going to be any different I am still committed to getting my life together and most importantly more time with my son I told I wasn t ready to have a baby I told her I probably wasn t going to travel and do all the things she wanted At least not very often Or actually not often at all But I told her she didn t have to settle around my plans and I understood if she didn t It would be selfish for me to ask her to just ride it out for a few years knowing full well she would do it if I asked I couldn t bear seeing her sad I couldn t bear knowing I was the cause of all that pain She shouldn t have to feel bad for wanting those things and put up with someone who wasn t as invested in the relationship as she was Man she didn t take it well She told me she didn t want to cause me any trouble or feel unwanted somewhere and that she would be out by the next day I told her she wasn t unwanted I was perfectly fine with the current situation I just knew that she wasn t I knew that she was sad And that I wasn t going to lie to her or lead her on The next day everything was fine As if nothing had happened Almost like if the conversation itself was all that she needed and she even seemed happy I dare say That same day I get this weird text from my kids mom Asking me to accompany her to an xray procedure for our son super weird that she would ask me to come along And to help her do her taxes I showed the text Aly and she said yeah she is just trying to spend the day with you Which I agreed was probably the case Nonetheless I told Aly I would go to the xray procedure because if anything else it would be a chance to see my son even if for a short period And that I definitely wouldn t be doing anyone s taxes As I m in the hospital something happened something finally snapped with Aly I get a frantic call from her friend that Aly had phoned her ex husband saying to take care of the kids and that she would be taking a bunch of pills Cops paramedics family Everyone rushed over to help her She had indeed taken a bunch of pills I heard about Xanax of whatever mg but idk if that s even possible some wine and slights cuts to her wrist She was rushed to the hospital and is now in stable condition Her family is not mad at me They told me that Aly sorta has a history of just straight up tragedy after tragedy turns out the guy she dated after her husband who she was madly in love with just randomly died of a heart attack and told me that the best thing I could do if I truly care about her is to block her number To not let her in my house To make sure I let her know I am absolutely not interested in even talking to her I understand the rational But man how can I just straight up ignore someone who has done so much for me I know it s not about my feelings I should think what s best for her I just don t think I can do it I m so fucking lost I need help,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
I m just tiredI could go on and on about how shitty my life is In reality it s not It really bothers me how I complain how my dad died And how I ve lost a lot of important people in my life Death fucked me up But it angers me to know that even though I ve been through a lot I still have an easy life Just because my sister is transgender and autistic and has so many behavior issues it doesn t ruin my life Sure it makes it hard And how my dad was a dumbass and fell off the god damn roof trying to repair a leak when I was But when I go somewhere to buy something swipe my card and don t even feel the need to check my bank account I always think of the children who have nothing How my car though used would be a monument to those somewhere else I am truly grateful for everything in my life How I ve lost so many friends and loved ones but I still have the privilege to get help And have a therapist and a psychiatrist I feel as if my depression shouldn t exist I have been given every single opportunity in life for greatness Yet I am still tired The final nail in the coffin was this exact day last year when I received the news of my childhood best friend and neighbor passing away in a car accident It broke me Not even I wasn t even a shell of a person My soul was nonexistent Everything I stood for and believed in is meaningless We all work so hard to fight just to die Immediately my ed came back and i was put on antidepressants I had to see my therapist and psychiatrist often My mom turned into a narcissistic asshole who had the audacity to tell everyone on the street her husband died for some pity She used people who attention She made others pity us and what hard lives we ve had as I sit in my half a million dollar home with AC and running water I don t know I feel like everyone who s died in my life and my ed my self harm how i was bullied out of my school it feels meaningless I have a god damn iphone I have no reason to be depressed I don t even feel anything I truly am just tired of living And not even that I crave death I just hate existence To inevitably die and be worthless ash and just a mere memory to those who cared about me How those people too will die and my existence will be nothing in the spacetime continuum How everyday I get up to grieve to work to study to have a perfect life just to die and becoming filth I just feel unmotivated to live How I hate my body so much that I am too afraid to have sex with my boyfriend How I feel like I look like a man How I am so undesirable and so so mean Oh I m not a good person and I know that It s as if my existence doesn t benefit the world I don t feel like a burden or that I need to die I just want to I hate this feeling of working towards nothingness And how I miss my loved ones so much I want nothing more than to just lay in bed and close my eyes forever,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
Consideration and thoughtHey Reddit I don t know how to really start this for my first post but hopefully you will bear with me and I hopefully at some point I ll be able to share my thoughts and feelings and people can empathize with me I m pretty much going to be throwing out my thoughts and I may sound strange at times so please forgive me if that happens I am suicidal It s not a continuous thing where I think about it non stop but I do get the thoughts often Some might look at me and think that I d have a pretty decent life and that there s nothing wrong with it I have friends who love me a family that cares about me sometimes and I guess I couldn t really pinpoint why I am suicidal I have been to the doctor for help after years of self diagnosis with depression I was not in the state of being too proud to ask for help but I was worried about being criticized by my family members I d often think about suicide and ways I could do it My main thought processes are Hanging myself I can t tie knots so this isn t really viable for me Drowning I have a morbid fear of water Jumping from a great height I also have a fear of heights I have never talked to anyone about this before apart from my doctor It took me a LOT of courage to visit the doctor Like I said earlier it took me about years to actually ask for help I think the main problem for me if you can call it a problem is that I d want to commit suicide but I can t find it in me to take my own life People might think it s a good thing that I m still here but for me it is an never ending battle with myself Whenever I have these thoughts I also think of how people would react to me successfully committing suicide I can imagine that they would feel bad obviously I think it s another reason why I can t do it I can give a lot to my friends and I am a rather selfless person I love my friends more than I love myself and I would do anything to make the ones I love happy I d walk on hot coals or broken glass or I d run into moving traffic just so my friend would smile They definitely wouldn t smile if I ran into traffic and died but this is my problem I suppose I don t want to be here but there are a few things in the way The doctor put me on a month waiting lost for a counselor and I ve been prescribed anti depressants My mother doesn t want me to take them because she believes that I will become dependant on them and she thinks I will turn out like a zombie I also asked one of my uncles and he described depression as a difficult thing He said it s all about training your mind to be positive For me that is very difficult and I didn t even think of bringing suicide up to him In honesty I don t think it s fair to tell anyone that I m suicidal I m only here writing this in the hope that I will find some relief Maybe I will I think the one true relief for me is suicide When I went for help my family members reacted negatively There was no praise in finding help which is understandable seeing as most of the time family members do not understand depression and suicide etc Friends might but in my eyes family doesn t My brother said I was lying to the doctor about how I feel which isn t true If I was crying and sighing non stop and I breathed deeply left the house and went to the doctor for what I thought was an emergency I needed the help While I wouldn t say I truly recieved help it was a weight that was lifted to find that my illness was recognised I was diagnosed with major depression anxiety and seasonal affective disorder at the start of this month I guess I really don t have a point to this because I m not really asking for help directly but it is a little better for me knowing I can speak to a wider audience about how I feel Suicidal thoughts for me are still ongoing everyday I am very very scared though as to if I ll go through with it Thank you for reading if you have I appreciate it,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
What am I supposed to doI had helicopter parents who rose me up with no life skills When I wanted to work after high school while getting my degree they said no Now my anxiety is so bad I can t even go out of the house What do I do man I feel so backed up in a corner I graduated from university and they re pressing me to find a job now but like fucking how I don t know how to drive They didn t let me All these years I missed out on life events friends social outings even fucking watering the back yard because I wasn t allowed these things I gave everything to them And they still can t acknowledge that my depression and GAD trauma is real even after an official diagnosis There s no way out for me no way out at all I m scared of simple things like walking out on the sidewalk I stopped going to therapy half a year ago because we re too poor It s so bad that my hands shake What do I do I mean holy shit the literally thing I can think of is just dying That s the only feasible option It s not normal that a year old is lacking all the essential skills an adult needs This isn t fucking normal And from all the years I ve been trying to reverse the side effects it s not fucking fixable either What do I do,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium
Everything in my life is in my favor right now So why do I feel like this I m getting paid to do what I love I constantly keep writing great music that I enjoy But it all tastes bland and feels black and white I have a girlfriend who I love Why do I feel so down Why do I have to keep being pushed through different medications Zoloft has come closest to working I m constantly crying At least I can get an erection again with this medication I should love my life And sometimes I do Until I sit down and think for a while I try so hard to make friends but I can always tell they don t want to be my friend It almost makes me wonder sometimes if I m autistic or something and I just don t know it I m an adult but I don t feel like one People treat things I don t know like common sense I feel so isolated The main reason I wouldn t kill myself is because I don t trust anyone else to take care of my cats I m sorry for the mini rant Idk where else to put this I think this all every night and luckily I stop myself Any advice,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
Thank YouHi first time posting not a throwaway because I don t think any of my friends really know my reddit account anyways After going through a lot of these posts here I ve realized that there are always people reaching out and willing to help those in need and I want to say thank you Its pretty touching to know that people care enough to browse this subreddit and to reach out to someone struggling I ve been recently diagnosed and things have gone downhill pretty fast I never saw myself as the kind of person to act on these terrible thoughts in my head but just the other weekend I stood on train tracks and cried because I felt accepting of that I m scared I found myself staring at a knife for minutes When I flew on a plane that traveled dangerously close to a city skyline the only problem I had was that my parents and brother were on the same flight and I didn t want them to die with me I hate having these thoughts If I m having these thoughts and I can t control them what is stopping me from acting them out if I m not in control of myself The depression is causing this and I want it to stop before it gets worse I m already on medication and going to two fricken therapists I don t want to act on this but I feel like I m heading to a darker and darker place,"Mental Distress, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium
Help I m having bad thoughts and they scare me I ve never gone to therapy consistently enough to be diagnosed with any kind of mental illness or depression but I remember being sad or dissatisfied most of the time even though for the most part I seem very mellow yet fun loving I ve had things happen in my past and in the recent past as well I ve experienced things that I d never experienced before and a lot of the were negative things I try to smile and be nice to people and do things that I love I ve picked up a few new interests along the way one being science pantheism The more I get into it the more disenchanted I am with humanity It s gotten to the point where I hate people and I think about how much I hate them while I m out in public I have a lot of anxiety about talking to people and I spend a lot of time all by myself I ve also been having lots of suicidal thoughts Like a lot Like multiple times throughout every day Even when I am happy I still think of killing myself I ve had this before but never to this extent and it really scares me The combination of hating people and fantasizing about suicide really seems like a recipe for destruction I don t think that I am capable of hurting anyone and I don t think I m capable of committing suicide but what if these thoughts get worse and I do something I can t take back It might just be that I need to go to therapy and let go of a lot of negative things in my life in my thoughts from my past I don t have anyone I feel safe confiding in all of this Does anyone else know how I feel Am I going crazy,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Therapy medication don t help when you don t want to get better and you just want to dieI ve been going through intense therapy and using different antidepressants that are prescribed to me for years now but it s so true that nobody can help you unless you want to get better and I really just don t want to get better I want this all to be over I don t want to be happy and be on this earth I mean I ve heard of people who spend their whole lives depressed and miserable Did it ever really get better for them Was them not killing themselves because suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem really worth it Was there problem at all temporary I think not so while suicide might be that for some people for a lot of people it s not a temporary problem it s a lifelong problem that will not go away,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
It s been years and I can t do it anymore I ve tried I really have For years now I ve seen counsellors psychologists psychiatrists pastors have tried different antidepressants went to school tried to further my career tried to make new friends and new connections became more active travelled more journaled taking up new hobbies etc etc etc etc I have tried I really have But I am tired I can t live with this pain anymore People may see me as selfish for doing it but it s selfish to expect me to live with this pain when I have tried for years I have held on I have tried to make things better But when your depression is this severe there is no cure There is no fix So am I really supposed to live in pain for how many more decades No I m not living to see I m done,"Mental Distress, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium
Pushed away the girl I loved She was the only person that made me happy Since then it s been a downhill My weight makes anything near impossible I m put down everyday I m just struggling with life Hello I m a long time lurker here and after an argument I just had with my mom I feel I need to share my story and convey my emotions It s gonna be a long one sorry Thank you to anyone who does infact take the time to read my story I m going to start by saying I m years old and have been battling depression for the past ish years I m a pretty big guy for my age st about lb I grew up independently cooking for myself and being young obviously cooking meals for myself which just weren t healthy at all in large portion sizes which have lead to me being the weight I am now I remember the days in school when I used to run m and enjoy all types of sports and now I can t do any of that at all Towards my GCSEs in school was when the depression started I had friends who would bully me make jokes about my weight thinking I was okay with it I wasn t It hurt inside I started skipping school and sleeping a lot that was my life for a good while However I started speaking to a girl in my year still not sure how that happened maybe she just felt bad for me We were just friends but spoke to each other everyday We d FaceTime each other for hours and just talk watch films together anything really This was the first girl who d actually taken the time with me and the first person I d ever really spoken to about personal things like my relationship with my dad I ended up falling in love with this girl because of how she treated me the only issue she liked my friend She d speak about him when we was on the phone together and I was jealous I could never say anything though we were just friends in her eyes As much as I loved this girl and how she listened to me I couldn t tell her how I felt and ended up pushing her away the biggest mistake of my life She was the one person in life who made me happy and I ruined that This happened a week after I finished school ready to start the next venture of my life I had the whole summer to enjoy myself but began to just stay in isolate myself and eat I did this for weeks It was coming to the end of summer and I had to apply somewhere whether that be a job an apprenticeship or college I waited until the very last minute and then joined college In all fairness college was great I met a bunch of new friends who I related to and enjoyed my time but the stress of assignments due in quickly added to my depression I finally spoke to a new friend who had faced depression in the past about how I was feeling who convinced me to speak to someone I spoke to a mental health nurse who was supposedly helping me She d speak to me over the phone for like minutes asking how I was each week and had booked me in for a session with a therapist the only thing being there was a huge wait like months to see one so she advised I d be put on anti depressants I was on mg of Citalopram for months I feel these were good for me I felt good and they were helping especially with the stress of college I was able to finish my college course with a pass and enjoyed myself over the summer it was a good time I have now started my second year at college being unable to find a job or an apprenticeship being rejected at every chance I saw this was my option for the year I decided by myself I should come off my Citalopram and did so without consulting anyone This was a bad decision Everything was fine for a week or so and then everything started coming back I feel depressed again and I m stressing out over little things My weight doesn t help either I have to catch a bus into the city where my college is which takes like minutes and then a minute walk This is fine but whatever I am wearing and whatever the weather I sweat abnormally either due to my weight or some issue that I don t know of yet It s the most embarrassing and uncomfortable thing I constantly feel like crap turning up to college or just walking around and being sweaty I could try and lose the weight but through my depression I m just not motivated even though I know I need to lose this weight The depression has gotten to the point where I m now experiencing suicidal thoughts I can t live with how unhealthy I am It kills me everyday I need a solution which is ultimately to lose weight but I just can t I honestly feel like I m going to kill myself soon either by eating myself to death or actual suicide because of this I just don t know what to do I thank you for reading my post didn t really know what to write or how to write and lay it out but however jumbled up my post is it was good to write this for my sake as someone that rarely speaks about their issues I d also like to thank everyone hear that offers their voice and helps out people that post their feelings here everyday whilst I am hear It s definitely helped me sometime looking at posts and seeing how people help each other Thank you,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

A letter to my grandmother Hey just a warning this is kinda sad A few years ago my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and she s developed another type since then She s been going to chemotherapy for a while but about two months ago she picked me up and she was wearing a hat I realized that it was because she had lost her hair and she was afraid what I would think That broke me inside a little That really opened my eyes up to the fact that she isn t doing too well and that someday soon I might lose her It took everything in me to not break down during that visit It screwed me up for the next few days I really didn t know what to do but I couldn t just say nothing and do nothing I couldn t just let her go without any effort on my part to love her while she is still here I ve never lost a loved one and I didn t know how to handle that possibility but I couldn t let her worry if I ll be okay or not after she leaves Finally I decided to give her a letter to let her know how I felt I was really scared because I didn t know if it d be acceptable to do that because how do you talk to a person about the fact that you might lose them soon But I did it and this is the letter I m so glad I gave it to her Hey Nana I love you I wanna start out with I love you because I think it s the most important thing to say I also really want you to know that no matter what happens I ll be okay I know you aren t doing too well and that you haven t been for a while And I just want to let you know that even if you pass away I ll be alright I ll be sad yes It ll hurt yes But I want you to know that I ll be okay I ve been through a lot and I m a strong kid nana I don t want you to pass away but I know that everyone has their time And I really want you to know that when your time comes I ll be alright Even though it ll hurt a lot I ll be okay So please don t worry about me I know I don t come over as often as I should I really want to fix that but with this virus going around and there being so many confirmed cases at where I live I don t know if I can safely I know that normally when I come over I spend most of my time looking at a screen And I m sorry about that I know that when I eat at the dinner table with y all I m usually the quiet kid who listens to everyone else speak And I m sorry that I don t participate more I want you to know that behind every time I ve hidden behind a screen or hidden behind my silence I ve been making an effort to show you how much I love you I m good with words but I never have been good at speaking my mind especially when it comes to family But I want you to know that all of you are so important to me You are all my family I ve had a lot of people try to fill that role and no one has been able to do it except for y all No one has been able to fill the role you fill except for you But please know that no matter what happens I ll still be okay And I m going to try harder to do better and be better I remember that one moment where I grabbed your hands and we had a meaningful conversation I ll never forget that You said you hated seeing me hurt I m doing better now Nana And I m gonna continue to get better I m always going to have that memory and because of that I ll always have a piece of you So please please don t worry about me I love you Nana And I hope you have a wonderful day Sincerely Your grandson I was in tears for days when I wrote this and terrified after I gave it to her I was told the next day that she hadn t read it yet because she didn t want to cry yet I told her when I handed it to her that it would be a sad letter But when I went over after a few days she just walked up to me and rubbed me on the back and went to go sit back down I didn t know for sure at first whether she read it or not but now I m certain And I m so happy that I gave it to her because now she can know that I ll be okay after she leaves I just didn t want her to worry She s still alive btw I hope to go over to her house this weekend I avoided posting the letter for a while because I didn t want this to be a publicity stunt or something I did for attention But some time has passed by and I want people to know that it s okay to reach out to loved ones like this It s okay to talk about stuff like this And personally I think it would be much better to do it while it they re still with you than regret it when they re gone and not be able to do anything then,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

I can t take this no more the agony is killing me LONG STORY SHORT So my name is Alfred Florin and I have been suffering from ocd pure o since I was I am now From a very young age I shook hands with Ocd and had anxiety problems but they were not a big deal it was present or days then it would go away without a huge effort When I was the sickness struck hard and I felt its presence so hard like it was a possession I will get there too but now let s continue the story My first ocd encounter was when I have stepped on a guy s foot when I was I guess You may be wondering what s wrong with that or what that means Well in Romania there is a urban myth it goes like this if you step on someone s foot and that person doesn t step on your back your mother dies Well there were many people around me cause it was the mayor elecrion that day and after I have stepped on that guy s foot I couldn t figure where he went cause it happened fast and then he disappeared in the crowd in an instant Well when I got home I thought at the fact that my mom could be dead cause I have stepped on that guy s foot I wasn t really scared or anything just a little worried I know it s stupid even for a year old but yeah Well I guess hours passed and I started thinking in that obsessive way that my mom will die and etc bad thoughts my chest started burning and everything I would say to fight it back I couldn t get me to believe that it s not real I have started crying and the pain made me feel like my life was ruined Well it passed really soon I guess the next day I was kind of ok I DID NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT After that experience till age I had various exeperiences like that one but it did not bother me on the long run Let me give some examples I was thinking at biomechanics and had some repetitive body movements I couldn t stop from doing them until I felt like I had hit the right spot or the movement was the right one I once sae a really f cked up thing on a website it was a soup made of a fetus Well after I saw that my mind started telling me that I would enjoy it and would like to eat it And I couldn t stop from imagining myself from eating it even though I hated these images it was pure hell cause I was a religious person and that made me feel like I had let God down Whenever I would go to church I would imagine Jesus and Mary having sex and I just couldn t stop thinking and I would get images and mind movies and I would just leave church feeling like CRAP It made me feel like I was such a bad person and I was actually crippled by these thoughts but it went off really fast and it did not affect my life on the long run I repeat I had periods when I would feel bad and depressed and felt a ache in my chest and it was just like my soul hurt not my chest I was really emotional all of a sudden I would get scared easily and cry really fast Let me talk to you abot age I had a friend at that did not believe in Jesus and we would argue all day long about religous stuff and I was explaining to him thing every single day about hours a day every damn day and that caused me a lot of stress but I really wanted to help him and I felt like it was my duty to stop his tears with the help of God Well one day I was sitting at my computer and one of his questions about god popped into my head I have tried to answer it myself but I couldn t get the answer right so I have seesrched it on google saw different responses but guess what not a single answer made me feel ok I felt a thirst of truth and the next minutes my chest lighted up little by little and the pain was getting stronger I was searching and searching for an answer and guess what That question transformed into questions per second In my mind I felt a tornado of questions making my soul and my brain hurt like no other thing in this world That day I have spent it wandering the streets cause I just couldn t sit still My chest and soul were on fire and my mind was full of questions I was walking like a mad man and looking straight into nothingness while while walking and trying to give myself a answer to all of the questions while slowly strating to realize that I was going to hell cause I started doubting God and its works and that made my chest EXPLODE and I have bursted into tears and the biggest and badeest panick attack I have ever experienced and the first My mom came home from work and I was keep telling her that my soul aches and I do not know what to do she was distressed by my situation but she was thinking that it s only a teenage thing and it will pass Nightime came and the pain and question were just king of gone but they were omnipresent Before bed I was a disaster I got down on my knees and prayed like tomorrow was the end of days but the next day the same thing happened It got to the point that I had to sleep with my mom and listen to the radio all night long and all day long just not to hear BRAIN THAT WAS TELLING ME THAT I WAS GOING TO HELL AND I HAD IMAGES OF ME BURNING IN HELL GLUED TO MY MIND AND SOUL Well It went like this for months until my father came home from abroad and went with me to a psychiatrist and thing went ok for a while but that psychiatrist did not care about me and it took years for me to understand that it was wrong seeing her She gave me the same pills all these years and we never did therapy but I had a fear of leaving the treatment behind and leaving my psychiatrist cause I thought no one would understand and I continued on for years the fifth year I was off pils off seeing a psychiatrist etc while I was seeing the psychiatrist everything was bad but it was bearable My life was shit but I could cope with it In these years i have been through all of the branches of OCD I had HOCD fobias Religious ocd blah blah I guess I had tasted all of it The Hocd wrecked my life but I went through it like a champ This last year the fifth I met Laura and my new ocd chapter began RETROACRIVE JEALOUSY IS MY PRIMARY ENEMY NOW It s not like I dont have the scars of my other ocd episodes I still was depreseed angry and full of pain when I met her but one thing I wasn t Hopeless I had a hope that I would get better I have met her march she was different she had sexual some really colorful sexual experiences and she seamed slutty She was talking to me about her sexual past and black men in her life and how she cheated on her ex cause she was horny and stuff We kissed one night and I saw something in her something special even if she talked like she did but I like her as a person she was funny and she had a nice personality We were toghether and one day I just couldn t stop thinking at these men she has been with and how she talked to me about them and my ocd started kicking after months in the reltionship my ocd came in and ruined us in a way I was unabe to please her sexualy unable to kiss her It got to the point where I wanted to break up because of it And i was at inch of doing it but we got through it and we were kind of ok not good but ok Well we were toghether i was getting ready for an exam in august when I found put that she cheated o me in june with her ex Alin several times in that month and they have been talking from some time I guess they started talking in april after I have found that in august I forgave her and was strict with her for a month so she would understand that she did wrong and it wrecked our relationship In that period an anger lighted up in me ai started talking to my ex too but nothing romantic or so just random talk I did not touch her or anything I have stopped talking to her at the middle of september cause I feel like that anger wasn t doing me any good and I need to forgive her Well everthing went really good until I found out that she has been in a club one night on the date of of september and she went with her best friend that recently got into a relationship guess with who the dude with she cheated on her ex Alin with he s called Paul she went to the club with Paul her best friend Andreea and Teodor a dude wich she has been seeing while she was in a relationship with her ex That night she got drunk she did drugs and she asked Teodor why did we stop seeing eachother and when he left she asked are you leaving my here with these crazies paul and andreea at the end of the night she was spitted on by a dude cause she intervened while he was shouting at Paul that he wants to fight him and Laura said fight me the he spitted her Teodor said Laura asked him to come back and take her back home to chill but she said that it is not true She lied to me about many things and I don t know what to believe I forgave her but after that night My ocd started wrecking my life again After I found this I contacted my ex and slept with her put of anger I did it with her twice and I regret it because I did not feel anything for her Laura found and she got over it Problem is we are ok with a new start though I don t trust her like some time ago and I can t stop asking her questions and details about her past and she cheating me how she did it why minor details anything I get an answer i feel better for an hour then it kicks again and I can t stop getting mental movies and images and hearing things about her and other man ablut her and Teodor Alin Paul and etc I really need to get back on track but it seems really hard I have told her that in order for this to work she need to stop talking to other men going to club stol doing this stop doing that etc is it right What am I doing I will go to a specialist who really cares but until then Please help me every word matters please tell me if my relationship is worth anything Would you forgive what would you do I just cant stop getting images and my brain tells me that she betrayed me twice not just once with Alin but twice with that night in the club and that I am not good enough and my self esteem is wrecked I can t even go for a walk cause everytime I do I see someone more muscular or more attractive than me in any way my ocd teels me that my girlfriend will like him cause he is better or that she look at him and admires him ai get really jealous and I lock myself into a shell Sometimes I feel like I am just like a little a wounded boy who just wants to be understood and loved and its hard because we live in a really plastic and harsh world Nobody cares about feeling no more and we all chase the money like hell Sorry for the grammar mistakes if you spot some but I am not well Thanks for reading,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping,

i feel numbim at the point where i ve concerned my psychiatrist half the staff i deal with in my house and my counsellor almost had to break confidentiality today two days ago i told my psychiatrist that i was have symptoms of psychosis again and told me to book a appointment with him as soon as possible and wants to put me back on meds that i don t like but work for multiple things that he s concerned about today i got a text from one of my youth workers asking of i want to go out shopping for things i need but i told her that i don t want to and that i can t even look at food right now so she asked if i was alright so i told her that i was in a low mood she then asked if i would go to the youth center to talk to her and i told her i would go but i didn t so she came to my house to check on me as i told her before she came that i hadn t gotten out of bed once she got to my place she knocked on my bedroom door and made me come out of my room and talk with her and one other worker to see how i was doing and if i needed and support at the time i didn t need any support i told them after having a conversation with them so they asked if i have had any thoughts of self harm or suicidal thoughts today and at the time i didn t after they left i made myself eat something even though it makes me feel sick to look at food and i can barely keep it down now and have no desire to eat ever and went back to my room and tried to apologize to someone who used to be my friend and see if they could ever forgive me but they said i was the only person they could never forgive and that i only had one chance with them they then listed off everything they hated about me and said a lot of thing that i wish wasn t said but they were i told them that i wanted to kill myself so they never had to deal with me again so they said to not kill myself because of them but they weren t the only reason and i told them that i said that i really was going to act on it so they said well i ll be telling someone about this i said i didn t if they did and that i was in a bad place in the first place so in response to that they said so you won t care if i go tell i said go ahead she may be the only person who could possibly stop me i asked that person why do you care i thought you hated my guts they said i m not gonna sit here and let you kill yourself i texted my counsellor and told him that i was in a really bad place just so he knew even if it was too late to stop me a small part of me didn t want to go through with it and that part is the only reason why i told him then i vaped some CBD in hopes that it would calm me down enough to not act on anything it did the trick till my counsellor could help me and almost called the staff or emergency services as he knows where i live if he couldn t get ahold of staff before i calmed myself i was actually crying which says how bad i was at the time because i haven t been able to cry for months no matter what happened to me and i told my counsellor that i was crying because he knows how bad things must be if i was crying i have a feeling that when i see my psychiatrist and tell him everything that has happened that there will be huge med change or if he sees me as a danger to myself or others hell admit me to inpatient care in the same building but that s assuming that he actually believes me for once sorry this is long but i cant keep this in without getting it out somewhere and if this isnt allowed just remove it and if you actually read this whole this im surprised,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

destroying myself on purpose but too afraid to die I ve been reading y all s stories for a few days now and it s convinced me to finally make a reddit account so I can tell my very pathetic story When I was around I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on medication for it This medication Vyvanse is really good at killing your appetite I have a bit of an eating disorder so I quickly became obsessed with the meds I still only eat one meal a day at best and I love it The downside to Vyvanse is that when it wears off it makes me EXTREMELY depressed and suicidal After a while though I developed this weird masochistic appreciation for it Like my eating disorder made me decide it was best to purposely find something to make me suicidal I lost so much weight with the meds that the only thing to do now is get rid of my body completely My eating disorder isn t about losing weight to look pretty in fact I think I m adorable My eating disorder is about wanting to get rid of my body I don t want to have a body I guess Am I making any sense I knew I d be ok without the meds I knew I could get help and live my life happily But I didn t want to have hope I wanted to suffer and die You can often see me cringing People point it out sometimes I literally cannot help but cringe at the thought that I m a human being that exists I hurt myself a lot too I used to cut but I ve gotten bored of that I like banging my head against stuff mostly Stupid I know I feel like if I hit myself over the head hard enough my soul or whatever will come loose and I won t have to live in this flesh prison anymore I remember once I slammed my head in a very heavy drawer and everything went black God it was blissful I ve tried recovering multiple times I ve tried throwing the meds out and looking for help But the problem is I EAT when I m not on them I EAT a TON and I can t have that I can t I can t I can t I can t I ve tried reaching out to people but I can t connect with anyone I m disgusted by the idea of telling my family and I only have two friends but I don t feel comfortable around them There s no one I just can t form meaningful relationships with anyone and I can t talk to anyone So recovery is out of the question I have to kill myself I ve spent all this time purposely making myself suicidal and it s gotten to the point where the thought of the sun rising tomorrow morning brings me to hysterical tears I ve only tried killing myself once I found the key to my father s gun cabinet and took out his pistol I sat on the floor asked the Lord for forgiveness and then put the gun to the roof of my mouth I got a horrendous image of the way my head would fold open when the gun went off I dropped the gun and cried harder than I had ever cried in my life I ve never been that scared before The only thing more pathetic than purposely making yourself depressed and suicidal is purposely making yourself depressed and suicidal and not being able to pull the trigger I m now I m and weigh lbs which is a lot for me I m still on my meds and still depressed just like I wanted to be but I know I won t kill myself I m sorry if this is a spit in the face to anyone I know it s horrible and pathetic and disgusting to ruin yourself this much on purpose I m still hurting myself in the hope that I ll toughen up and finally end it I m sorry that this is so long and confusing I ve never really had anyone to talk to It s a weird situation too I guess it needed a lot of explaining,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

I know it doesn t mean much but here At this point I have no where else to turn too My friends don t want to hear it my family doesn t and so on With what little I have I honestly just need to vent before I die I m the standard age where no one knows what to do or where to go I want to be a writer I m just the fucking definition of a loser I learned a long time ago when I was I was diagnosed with not only depression by a very light form of autism Basicly I don t understand something s when it comes to learning it wasn t anything that couldn t be treated with therapy However the depression stuck I was bullied mercilessly at school and not one of the teachers or principles gave a damn about it They where more content to just watch It was embarressing to them that they had to go up to the government and tell them to fucking fix it Through out that part of my life I was a loner and never thought I would get friends I would just come home from school go play video games and imagine I was a hero a hero that no one understood but still wanted him around Then high school came My first year in grade proved to be the best part of my life I joined Anime Club I became a dnd player I made tons of new friends I helped set up a convention and so on But then grades and happened I met this one girl and at first I was shocked she asked me out first I took her to a movie and we kissed once I think then she didn t want to date me anymore and it was only a three week relationship so I didn t think much of it then her friend came into my English class and yelled stop raping my friend That s where it all went down hill The only place I was from that point was the anime club I was called a freak and a rapist At the same time a guy wanted to kill me constantly tried to set me on fire twice in the same day People relentlessly mocked me and I was the out cast again same deal in g At that point I reached fucked it and for my grad quote I said thank you Flying Spaghetti Monster The only people that liked that where the anime club members and my history teacher Everyone else got mad at me and said that was offensive and it didn t get better from their I left the high school and never turned back after I was done with tests and such Then the college College was to be a fresh start a new beginning but life has a way of fucking you up their as well As I said before I wanted to be a writer I wanted to write sci fi I took psychology English history and political environment But English and political weren t what I thought they where At first English was nice I met a girl their and we started dating for six months and the proffesor was really nice However things took a turn in the classes when it all became about how sucky men are and how awesome women are Both English and political environment kept saying that over and over and over again Men ruined this men ruined that white men destroyed everything that was good Hearing that day in and day out got on my nerves I know I wasn t bad I tried to be the better person in life but it never stuck I felt alone in those classes as no one wanted to hear um what about The writer of game of thrones He s white and awesome And so on but no all the stories we read white men are bad All the political talk was Tumblr and SJW bull shit disproven by multiple doctors and institutions And the tipping point was my gf at the time At first she was the women of my dreams She was beautiful to me shy nerdy a little creepy really liked creepy weird stuff and so on but then she met another girl and this girl twisted her as she was her only friend out side of me She would poke and prod my gf telling her I was bad and intentionally go out of her way to strain our relationship It got to the point my gf was starting to mentally abuse me andverbally abuse me I tried to fight for her I tried and nearly became I love her and I don t care what she does to me But my friends stopped me and forced me to look into the reality of the picture she was bad for me I gave it into our relationship but she gave nothing back I confronted her about it and everything I accused her of she accepted and never even once defended her self She accepted everything I said and had no remorse over it I then told her to go fuck her self and left breaking up with her And then even to add on to that her friend abanonded her after as she got what she wanted After that I then started focusing on finding a job but that came to no avail their was one girl I tried dating online but she just cheated on me and abandoned me I tried therapy only for it to fail me miserably six years of it and nothing came from it My family is sick and tired of seeing me sad I don t even talk to them about it anymore I just go and out a fake smile on to try and let them know I m fine when secretly I m not My friends abandoned me they go to me for their problems and when I try to go to them it s stunning radio silience I m alone and I have nobody the only reason I m posting here now is for someone to know that your loved Even if I don t know you please don t follow me Be better then the idiot who thought their was no other way I can t find my way out

i dont know know what to doi hate saying this but i don t know what to do i am and in my mind i am thinking wow how pathetic i m of course i m suicidal and seeking attention but i have felt like this since i was a little kid but even worse now my mom always yelled at me about how i m going to grow up to be homeless and a failure all just because i didn t do a simple chore i was always lazy and shit i m so weak why am i complaining when there are other people getting abused and neglected constantly and i m crying all because my dad called me useless and i can never be serious in front of my friends so they ll never believe me if said i want to kill myself all i want is to be happy again my hobby is cooking and usually do that when i m in a good mood i stopped cooking for a month and i would stay in my room locked up and only get a few hours of sleep and then miss school my parents noticed i was being weird but the thing is i don t think they believe i could ever be depressed either that or they just don t know anything about mental illnesses i can t really self diagnose myself but i did stop eating and i didn t want to talk to anyone and i didn t laugh or get angry all my grades in school dropped and that made me feel even more horrible my dad asked me if i was getting bullied but i wasn t and he said that s all he could think of i know they care for me but it s kinda hard to believe that when today my dad yelled at me and it s usually my mom who yells at me but he said you are not an adult and you can t just do whatever the hell you want you keep giving us an attitude and i m sick and tired of it he said a whole lot of other stuff and i know my parents work and shit just to come home to keep my brother and i happy it s just that you can t buy happiness and they keep doing that they buy me whatever to keep me happy but it only makes them mad and i don t want them to just keep giving me shit because i m trying to make it easy for them but then they get mad and call me spoiled and make me feel like shit i want to talk to them but every time i do they just say what because they are old and they can barely hear so i speak louder and then they think i m giving them an attitude and then they mad at me and then i can t really tell them how i feel they refuse to get hearing aids or at least something to help them hear they are always mad and keep disappointing them they are both old fashioned so whatever is happening to me they don t understand i just don t know if can live like this no one can help me i m stuck here thinking i m a failure and i am i want to die every person i talk to tells me it will get better but how can you say that when it just gets worse i even managed to cut myself and it didn t hurt it did but i didn t care i don t know why i cut myself why did i cut myself today i don t know what s wrong with me,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
I don t even know anymore I usually don t ever post how I m feeling on threads or even tell my therapists how I m truly truly feeling because I feel guilty for these thoughts that cross my mind But I feel like I m going to go crazy after this Christmas I hate this time of year I ve always had mental health issues been hospitalized twice as a teenager self harmed drank mouthwash just to get drunk to ignore my feelings whatever I had a great life growing up nothing really triggered me to become this way I guess my brain is very chemically imbalanced Anyway I m I had my daughter at to keep the story short I had a healthy pregnancy besides my type one diabetes but I took care of myself I was scheduled to be induced and she was perfectly healthy at the time however due to doctors negligence and not paying attention to signs of distress She was born having seizures in minutes and her whole brain was completely damaged I was told she would not live the ideal life If you saw her in person today you would never guess anything was wrong with her but there is she is doing way more than anyone expected however I ve noticed my mental health getting worse and worse every year she was diagnosed with HIE LGS and type diabetes within the first years of her life now that she s getting older her seizures are getting worse she s becoming more delayed and I just honestly hate saying I don t want to do it anymore I m tired of seeing kids happy on Christmas while my daughter is out of it not knowing how to rip open a present I hate her birthday because her grandparents want to throw her a party every year and I hate everyone watching her open gifts me opening them and she s just so out of it and has no clue what s going on and I don t mean I don t want to do it anymore as in I don t want her anymore because I love my child to death she s the strongest child I know that can light up a room with her smile I mean I don t want to watch her struggle every day of her life even though she doesn t realize it I have become so numb to her daily seizures because it s the normal for our family Im tired of the mix between of hopeful days and I don t even know what s coming days I don t want to die but I just don t want to live anymore It makes me so upset seeing neurotypical kids doing normal things and I have to watch my daughter just struggle to walk sometimes I hate feeling this way I fucking hate it Having LGS also means at any given time if she falls asleep she might not wake up due to a seizure in her sleep I hate this overwhelming feeling I feel selfish most days since she s the one who s really struggling I m at a very all time low in my life I don t even know what I want anymore I just feel so numb to these doctors appointments I have to go to for her I question am I doing enough or not how can I do enough when I m depressed and numb as ever just sitting on the couch watching her do the same things over and over and over I don t even know how to express this to anyone because it s the same response oh I m so sorry I know it s hard but your strong blah blah blah I get people don t know what to say but at the end of the day it s something I have to do Something I still have to deal with Words won t change anything because that doctor did permanent damage I would never end my life but I just don t want to live anymore and I can t get these constant worrying feelings out of my head I try to look at the reality point of view but I still feel like I m going to just have a huge mental breakdown and idk where I m going with this I just needed this off my chest God I love my daughter so much she did not deserve this suffering I just want my will to live back,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

There s so many ways I could kill myself right at this very moment I ve never noticed this before and it s really scaring me My mind is absolute chaos right now and I don t know what to do Everything I see has potential to kill me Everything And when I close my eyes it s limitless I m young enough that people would say I have too much to live for I feel so fake whenever I try to start a conversation about my depression because it s probably just hormones or being a teenager and then I end up making some half hearted suicide joke and everyone around me feels uncomfortable It s not like I ve ever been diagnosed or anything I know that so many people self harm I know that all of them have real problems and struggles in their lives I don t There s always food on the table and money in the bank and while I may not have enough money to go to college I definitely am a very privileged person I m just looking around the room right now and it s freaking me out I think I m going to cry To be quite honest I shouldn t I ve been crying a lot lately because I m a really weak person and I don t know how much longer I can do this But I still don t know if I could really commit suicide I m such a fake person I probably just self harm for attention too because even though I haven t told anyone I do it I really want to I would love to just sit and talk and talk and talk for an hour straight about everything I would love to tell my story from start to finish You see I m selfish You see how many times I ve said I I m selfish I think something s wrong with my mind It just keeps twisting and turning I don t think it s supposed to do that I can t focus on anything and this post is getting really out of hand I m sorry I just can t concentrate very much I think this is getting really long and I m can t go back to read over this or edit it right now because I can t think properly I m sorry TL DR This was a completely useless post and I can t make my brain shut up Sorry,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Day Hey Sorry I was delayed with Day update but I was really out of it today and pretty much stayed in bed as much as possible all day I decided on this update I should probably give some back story about me so you can get a better understanding as to why Im here where I am now Im a yr old female and come from a pretty rough childhood I was molested abused both physically and verbally by relatives and grew up with no money in our household My mum was an alcoholic from pretty much as far as I can remember and my Dad left us when I was Because of Mums alcohol abuse I was the primary care giver for my two younger brothers Im the second oldest but our older brother is years older than me so he moved away from this fucked up family as soon as he could and I was left to care for my Mum and brothers We had to live with my Grandpa when I was because he was getting too old to care for himself yet somehow he had the energy to beat me and kill my cat in front of me when he got angry It was always me who was the target My brothers were treated like royalty and I was treated like scum But I tried my best to keep pushing I made sure my brothers got to school okay I tried to go to school when i could which wasnt very often because Mum was always so drugged up on anything she could get her hands on I was scared she d die in her sleep She slept all day and all night and only got up for like an hour or two in the evening to give us a can of spaghetti to share between the three of us and wine for herself This when on till I was about or I was beaten by my Pa every day always starving and making sure Mum didnt die in her sleep One day she went missing for over a week and while she was gone and my brothers and I were taken from our home into emergency foster care I assumed the school and neighbours notified the authorities about us being alone with our Pa because of how abusive he was Anyway we were there for two weeks before they found our Mum at some randoms dudes place all beaten and drugged up We had to go see her in hospital and it was pretty scary Ive never seen someone so yellow before I didnt know skin could be that colour Skip a few years and we are still in foster care and Im trying to get my life together I start going back to school even though I wasnt welcome there by teachers or students I got bullied by both all the time and it pretty awful I think the worst time was when I was trying to eat my lunch a block or two away from the school because I was too scared to be near people but some boys stalked me and beat me They kicked me in the chest and it was so hard to breathe and when I told the teachers they told me I shouldnt of been off school property Well fuck my bad Anyway when I was our government case worker found my Dad in another state and sent my younger brothers and I to live with him his new wife and two little girls I was pretty happy to finally feel like maybe I had a second chance at family but that didnt turn out so well In my short months of living there I was beaten by my step mum bullied even worse at my new school and was on watch by my parents because for some reason I was the devils child and couldnt be trusted This was about the time a girl I knew at school who I sorta considered to be my first friend told me that her boyfriend was cutting himself and she showed me pictures I asked her how he did it and she told me he could get razors out of pencil sharpeners That thought really scared me and I found it pretty gross A few weeks pass and my step mother was yelling at me because Im just like my mother and Im useless to everyone and I thought about the self harming my friend told me When she left the room I sat on my couch and cried for hours frantically trying to get this razor out of a pencil sharpener and I didnt know how It really infuriated me so i stomped on it till i got it out I dont know what came over me but I just started cutting All down my thighs and my right wrist I stopped when I realised that if anyone found out then I could be in more trouble A few days go by and im doing the night dishes and my step mother bursts into the kitchen and starts grilling me about not using colour coated pegs to hang the washing yeah she was OCD as fuck and I got really angry and waved my arms at her and told her she s nuts This revealed my cutting on my wrists though and when she noticed them she immediately grabbed my arm that was covered in cuts and dragged me to see my father They both started telling me that it was unacceptable and theyre both extremely disappointed in me I got my phone taken away for months and no computer use for a year I went back into my room and just sobbed my eyes out Thankfully through the government system I was seeing a counsellor and I told her what had happened and the next day I was out of my Dads care I had a boyfriend at the time who i only just met but his Mum was nice enough to let me stay with her till I got my own place My two brothers stayed in my Dads care for a while but were sent back to the state we originally came from because they didnt want them anymore I stayed with my boyfriends mum for about a year till I was and could live in student accommodation for school My schooling never really improved and I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety during this time and kept to myself a lot It wasnt until I was that I sort of made a couple of friends through my boyfriend and school that I felt a little happier However my boyfriend cheated on me after a couple of years of dating and that put me into a whole new hole of depression I started self harming again and drank every cheap night I could out in town and slept with pretty much anyone because I wanted to feel wanted by someone Even if it was for a night I wanted to feel like I was something to someone This went on till I was with a couple of boyfriends in between and I left school to find a job and also I moved into a shared home to make it easier to start saving and have more money to buy things I wanted I also adopted a cat during this time and was actually pretty happy Unfortunately i had little contact with my brothers and foster carers but I was getting my life on track and it was good I was working two jobs at one point in a restaurant and a nightclub I really loved it One night at the night club a man asked for my number since it was his st birthday and I dont believe in love at first sight but I just knew he was the one for me I gave him my number and we instantly fell in love I could write forever about how much I adore this man but Ive already said so much and Im sure no one has read this far anyway But I loved him so much I saw our entire future together and I didnt see myself alive past but with him I saw forever We saw each other every weekend and went through a lot of anazing times togethers but like all relationships we had our rough patches He had severe anxiety and I thought I was over mine so I gave him my all to get him the support he needed to get through his but he was stuck in his own dark cloud of anxiety and nothing could get him out of it We dated for almost a year but that last few months were torture He was so depressed but not suicidal thankfully and always so anxious I gave him anything he needed or wanted and I forgot to take care of myself My depression was creeping back and my anxiety flared up whenever we were together We decided it was best we went our own ways to get ourselves back to who we once were when we first fell in love I dont deny we are out of love now but we dont speak as often as we use to and its still hard to see him pop up on my newsfeed every now and then After that my depression was creeping anymore and it crashed on me like a tonne of bricks My anxiety turned into full on panic attacks and I started feeling extremely suicidal One night I was just at home distracting myself with a video game and my roommate forced himself into my room and started yelling at me for something I dont remember what it was but next thing I know I was running down the street and I ran for about or kms till I came to a bridge This bridge was over water and i stared at it sobbing from the bottom of the walk way It was like am and for some reason I couldnt control my own body or mind I climbed to the highest point of the bridge and called my recent ex boyfriend but he didnt answer I tried to call him times before I gave up and sent him a really long message about how much I love him and not to blame himself for what Im about to do He didnt respond and I remember taking my shoes off turning off my phone and putting into my left shoe and my wallet into my right shoe I climed over the railing and I suddenly felt happiness I laughed so much and could feel the cold wind against my fingers and toes and just felt relieved I knew I was going to die and I was happy But someone who I guess was a late night runner grabbed me under my arms and used all his strength to slide me back over the railing It hurt like hell i thought my back was going to break Next thing I know I woke up in hospital and I was scared I was in a huge as fuck room with just cold toast and juice beside me and my belongings next to them I grabbed my phone and had a text from my ex He told me the hospital tried to contact him because he was my only emergency contact but ge couldnt see me in hospital because it would crush him to see me how I was I begged him to come but he wouldnt No one came No one from work called to see if I was okay or my housemates I had to stay there for two weeks and it was fucking boring and scary at times Thankfully I knew one of the guards there who I use to work with at the nightclub and he kept me company and snuck in food and gifts from outside We still keep in contact now but its hard to organise to see each other since we live in seperate states While I was in hospital I organised to move away I decided it was time for a change and away from this place so two days out of hospital I had everything organised and moved to another state A guy i met through playing games gave me his couch to crash on till I could find work and my own place It wasnt long till things went sour I told no one I moved away and when people found out they were pretty pissed and dont talk to me now and if they do its because its a pity check up The guy i was living with raped me and said I owed him this because I was staying at his house free of charge It took a long time to find a job and i found one in a cafe close by but as soon as I was alone I left that house and was homeless for a couple of days till I found a shared rental with some really nice people But my job was now two hours away and only casual so it wasnt worth the trams and buses for maybe a shift or two a week So i quit and lived off government payments I also broke my arm as well so finding work was really hard I also got back in touch with Mum because we were in the same state and I was hoping she was doing okay She wasnt but she was trying to get better so I offered to help She informed me by Pa had died thankfully and she was waiting on his inheritance so she could start her life fresh and I was pretty proud of that She needed a change as much as me and even though she was a pretty crap Mum when I was younger I wanted to give her a second chance When my arm was better I scored a job in a call centre that Im still doing now and its really stressful but Im not face to face with customers and that makes me pretty happy My mum got her inheritance and offered me grand to help set me up in my own rental so I dont have to couch surf anymore I declinded every time she offered because Im really independent abnd hate hand outs but she insisted for a couple of months so I said yes and got myself set up in my own place Things were looking up My depression was still there but I was distracting myself with work and started seeing someone as well But my ex kept coming back into the picture saying how sorry he was and wanted to see me and all this crap and I fell for it but it did more harm to my mental health than good so I had to tell him I need to be alone Anyway my Mum insisted she d buy all my things and not worry about paying her back but I told her not to spend grand on me since I want to pay her back abd I only need the essentials like a fridge bed washing machine and kitchen utensils She agreed but a few weeks later when it all arrived at my house it was more than I asked for I told mum I dont need all this stuff and I cant afford to pay her back for this She insisted not to worry about it and just be a lady and get yourself set up I was really happy I finally had my own space and work was a good distraction and Mum was back in my life but coming to the last few months it has been hell Mum decided to sue me for all things she bought me because I havent paid her back yet and when I told her what I could afford to give her out of my budget that wasnt good enough so she told me I should kill myself and I wont be missed and she ll see me in court My work started cracking down on us and it was flaring up my anxiety my ex was still trying to be apart of my life and it was really hard to maintain friends here and also make new ones I was slowly becoming in debt due to my phone bill and my internet provider screwed me over too Financially Im not doing good at all Im constantly eating bad and my nice body I had before is turning into mush My boyfriend was complaining we arent having enough sex because Im too overwhelmed all the time and I was becoming distant I was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder this year and that stresses me out a tonne So one day I just snapped My life isnt getting better in fact its getting worse and this is when the attempt came into place a couple of weeks ago If youre exhausted from reading all this then thats just about as exhausted I am all the time My life was a mess and no matter how much I try to turn it into good I get screwed over Some of you know I have a dog Eva I adopted her a few weeks prior to be in my loving animal family but shes extremely active and my depression over this last year hasnt been good for her or my home so I gave her to a friend at work and shes doing well Anyway I snapped I broke up with the guy i was seeing i deactivated my social medias and downed mg of valium and some alcohol I gave my cat a kiss and cuddle and let her outside and Eva stayed right by my side as I fell asleep on her tummy What I forgot until the next day is that when I was taking all the drugs I told a close friend at work what I was doing and he came over and saved me Im not sure why I told him but he said I wasnt making sense on the phone and I just fell asleep and knew something was wrong I woke up in his house all sweaty and my stomach was so sore Eva was at the end of the bed and he was in a chair beside the bed He told me everything that had happened and I apparently begged him not to take me to the hospital and so he just kept an eye on me instead During the last couple of weeks Ive been using my savings to a things Ive never done before before I try to kill myself again I told work I needed time off and went to a state ive been to a few times and saw a girlfriend I knew and had an amazing time with her I told her everything I did and she was happy I was trying to do nice things for myself to see that my life was worth living for I also saw my favourite band play live which was so fucking amazing I never felt so pumped

What do I do now Had an appointment with my care coordinator today what I assume to be my last appointment after being told despite what the medical evidence supports that he felt that I would get better and am not in need of the service my progression has been slow to naught with even a handwritten note from my last therapy session stating that I do not have the tools to cope with the result of said therapy lowering my depression score by points and increasing my anxiety by My care coordinator arranged a psychiatrist to prescribe me lamotigrine lamictal but i have yet to even touch near my therapeutic dose I haven t been made aware of a plan in an increase of dose and now have been cut off from any known plan All I know is that i ll be placed under the care of a new lesser controlled team to whom I will have to re refer to every time I finish my sessions of therapy I feel that I am not sick enough or not in crisis enough to be worth their time that despite being told to read a self help book my carer did not bother to do the same to research the repercussions of creating an experience in which i feel abandoned and invalidated Ignoring every time I say I m getting worse denying me my right to a written diagnosis while still treating me under a working diagnosis Giving me medication that will kill me and then throwing me off to the curb like it s not a risk I won t save them up to overdose and then creating me a reason to do so What am I supposed to do act on these painful emotions to gain my right to treatment what s the point I d have to repeatedly do so to stay within the system wouldn t be easier to just kill myself not that it s an easy thing to do but it s easier then trying to hurt yourself enough to get treatment and when I think about it in that sense then I really do fit the borderline PD that society hates me for it s bad enough I ve be idealization self mutilation and suicide but now it s becoming the only options as a call for help or an end to the suffering,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Plans If you would like to hear my plans for suicide I have two and they are both flawless I am actually proud of this one So first pour a energy drink into a blender then add mg of Vyvanse mg of paliperidone mg of Zoloft then blend it all up After blending this up I put a noose around my neck I drink the cocktail and inject a epipen epinephrine into my neck then hop If you are unfamiliar with these medications basically Vyvanse caffeine and epinephrine are all stimulants that will when taken together in such quantities will destroy my cardiovascular system The anti psychotic and depressant have known adverse reactions The second is much simpler Fill the bath tub with flammable liquids and maybe some solids to keep it burning Then submerge and ignite,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

The thought of the end is the only thing that makes me happy I m not entirely sure what to say I often find myself lost for words but now I need them more than ever I have been depressed for a while now and I have tried oh lord have I tried to get rid of it to make it disappear I no longer think I have the capability to be happy it seems almost impossible I m going to apologize in advance for the inevitable essay but this is my first post and I have a lot of things I need aired I need someone to hear me to listen to me before I explode First of all my mother died when I was she was and died suddenly Obviously there was a lot of heart ache sadness and so on the stuff you would normally expect from anyone who loved their mother My father worked away so my sister and I never had a stable home sometimes we lived with my Nan and Grandfather other times we would stay with my Auntie and then occasionally my other Nan would look after us My mother s mother was a wonderful person I finally allowed myself to open up to someone and she took me in with open arms She was the only person who would tell my father when he was wrong She died when I was To this day seeing my Grandfather cry was the most heart wrenching thing I have ever witnessed I then found a wonderful boyfriend he treated me like I was everything but of course my best friend didn t like sharing my time with someone else and then she left my life too I still miss her It was at this time that I had noticed that my eczema had started to get worse and nothing was curing it I took my skin problem to a doctor and was referred to a dermatologist He was baffled and had no idea what it was tried different tests and treatments but to no avail Since then I have been to various doctors around the UK travelling far and wide to seek treatment My condition got even worse my body was is covered Itchy and sore Later that year my uncle died and then so did my Grandfather I started to think it was all my fault and that maybe I was a curse to my family I tried to commit suicide three times and carved the shit out of my thighs I stopped eating properly because I thought I was enormous I weighed kg My boyfriend could no longer handle me I was erratic and self destructive He left after two years of suffering me It was at this point that I had really decided that life wasn t for me I was in pain all day every day because of my skin I had to leave school after my GCSE s because the pain was unbearable and I could hardly motivate myself to leave my bed I then got diagnosed with a new illness called Myasthenia Gravis for those who don t wish to Google the disease it is simply something which makes your muscles incredibly weak to the point where it is hard to walk eat and sometimes even talk I am now on steroids which is helping but the condition isn t curable I am just hoping that it will go into remission someday On top of all this I had to look after my year old sister since my grandparents were no longer around to do so Huff I am starting to feel like I am writing this for the wrong reasons I feel like I m writing a sob story and that wasn t what I wanted I ll quickly explain what happens after that I decided to get myself better mentally tried so unbelievably hard finally felt like I succeeded got my boyfriend back after a year of trying moved out of my house and into my boyfriend s parents house because my father was verbally abusive and kind of got my social life back on track But here I am now Back where I started Rejected all of my friends again Too afraid to leave the house My boyfriend is wonderful but I feel like he can t give me what I need I sit here every day feeling like there is a massive empty space inside of me I m desperately trying to find something to fill it but there is nothing I want nothing from this life anymore If I knew that I could die tomorrow without hurting my boyfriend or my sister I would do it I would end it I have no one to talk to because I am too afraid of losing my boyfriend again and I don t trust anyone else I am poor as shit because I had to leave school because of my illnesses and couldn t get a job for the same reason The government is also unwilling to help at all I am now kg heavier than I was before because of my medicines and I feel like an elephant I am terribly unsatisfied with the way that I look I have seen a glimpse of happiness and it is totally not worth the effort This sounds incredibly gay I have no idea who I am anymore and I am so scared for my future I just want to curl up into a ball and fade away I have tried to leave out my father in all of this because even thinking of him makes me angry however I will tell you this that man can go to hell for what he has put me through I am not living I m just wasting time TL DR Was depressed then happy ish and now I see no point in living,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Too sick and poor to liveSicknesses I am blind in one eye scarred retina from birth have hypothyroidism and an undiagnosed stomach condition that I was told was barrette s stomach gastro paresis or my kidneys aren t filtering my blood correctly some sort of porphyria I get nauseated after every other meal I puke dry heave for hours and sit in a hot shower until it turns cold and then sit in a cold shower for an hour until I am nearly hypothermic Sometimes when in the hot water I dump ice water over my head to body shock the sickness away for a few seconds This gives me terrible colds that just add to the misery I ended up in the hospital for four days when I became so dehydrated that my kidneys were shutting down and my muscles were cramping up from lack of sodium I was given scopolamine Zofran and morphine When I was stable enough to hold down a bite of pancake they sent me home with a forty thousand dollar hospital bill and the recommendation that I see a specialist I applied for charity assistance from the hospital and have not seen a hospital bill since so I hope that money is not owed anymore A few months later I was lucky enough to get decent affordable health insurance which I used to get every test conceivable These tests went on for years and I was never given a definitive diagnosis My mother had end stage COPD and congestive heart failure She was on oxygen and could not leave the house She couldn t even make herself a meal without nearly suffocating to death My step father had throat cancer and liver cancer My step father had radiation treatment for the throat and liver but the throat cancer came back He then had a full laryngectomy When he came home from the hospital he was on a feeding tube and I had to crush his pills and feed him a liquid diet through his feeding tube He also needed his stoma cleaned and suctioned and a surgical wound that opened up packed and treated I did all this while also making meals for my mother doing the store runs laundry cleaning house and dealing with my own sickness The day after my th birthday in July my mother died from heart failure My Step father had been home from the hospital for one week when she passed and could not even speak They were married for years My step father s liver cancer has now come back and I fear he doesn t have long My finances I have been out of work for the past years I moved in with my mother and step father when I got too sick to work It worked out well for the three of us for the past years because despite my illness I was still able to take care of my terminally ill parents We were able to survive financially because of my parents disability checks and long term settlement check of per month and two rentals properties that were owned with no mortgage as long as there were renters anyway My uncles and my grandfather s ex wife which he was married to for years after the passing of his first wife of years now have complete control and ownership of the two rental units This past year the sickness has subsided somewhat and I want to get back to work but am afraid Afraid that the sickness will hit at work and get me fired again afraid to get back into to job market after being out for so long I inherited and now own my home with no mortgage but cannot pay the property taxes and insurance I am told I cannot take a mortgage out on my house because I don t have a job I also inherited a per month settlement check that will run out in two years It is not enough to live off and pay the taxes and insurance I also had to hire a lawyer in order to get the house and checks because my mother s will was not valid due to having been notarized with only one witness not two as per my state s law I still owe that lawyer dollars I am racking up penalties for the taxes I have yet to pay I will also be losing my health insurance at the end of this month because the premiums are going up by for the lowest tier plan It will be extremely difficult to try and find a roommate to move into the house because the house is in a state of disrepair and my terminally ill step father is in the master bedroom Who would want to move in with one sick dude and one terminally ill dude Plus the bedrooms are tiny I have two uncles One is in credit card debt and will offer no help the other has gifted me dollars since my mother s death but I cannot ask for more I have no idea how I am going to pay the bills next month I owe to a lawyer in medical bills that I know of in student loan debt in property taxes that are accruing penalties and about dollars a month in expenses insurance electric water etc I have A home valued by the city at but would sell for maybe due to that state of disrepair and per month for the next two years My plan I will leave a hand written will valid in this state leaving the house to my step father I will then acquire a small boat or kayak I will load a back pack with weights and travel as far east into the Atlantic Ocean as I can in one night Enjoy the stars and one last sunrise I will them get into the water wearing the backpack while hanging off the edge of the boat Then I will shoot myself through the brain This way if the bullet does not kill me the water will My body will sink into the depths below and that will be the end of me There will be no clean up no coroner no funeral just gone disappeared from the world

Therapist told me not to call anymoreSo it s been years and counting of continually worsening depression I finally started seeing a therapist I really like and feel like I work well with about months ago I d say it took about two before I really felt like things clicked in and I wasn t so intimidated by the professional environment I am not at all the type who easily shares with others out of a combo of crippling shyness realizing others don t really know what to do say care etc so I basically have always been alone in my struggles I have an emotionally abusive mother and while my dad and I are on fine terms we re not super close I don t really have any friends to vent to as not many really know I have issues and regardless as mentioned previously they never know what to do or say and can t babysit me a year old Anyways after a few months my therapist said I could start calling her I felt so guilty every time I did because I hated the idea of being a burden and forcing her to take work home with her as who likes that I knew I was possibly overdoing it admittedly I was only doing it maybe a third of the times I ve felt super suicidal over the last few months but unfortunately I feel quite suicidal very often with this event surely worsening that Anyways today at our session she gave me her business card and said this is the best number to reach me on Like First of all I really hated how passive aggressive that was I would have MUCH preferred her telling me that I was calling too much and us discussing that Secondly there is no way anyone could ever believe that her office number is her best number as she s only in her office days so there would be no way to get in touch past pm when she leaves or on a weekend or the one day a week she starts in the afternoon Anyways now I feel super awkward and uncomfortable I knew this had to be coming but at the same time prayed it wouldn t and also really hated the way this happened as I would have preferred a confrontation This really made me panic because I honest to god have no one to talk to EVER in dire moments and honestly just worsened suicidal thoughts And now I feel like a huge step back has been taken in my comfort level as previously mentioned I do not open up well at all and I feel like this has just set me back on that exponentially harder as now I feel more like I am sitting in a job interview meeting with a teacher or employer etc than a therapy session In fact this really has made me never ever want to call her again on any phone number or use email to do anything but discuss scheduling matters I have a session tomorrow and honestly just want to cancel the one I have on Monday which is the first time I ve ever not wanted to go to therapy I just feel like I got punched in the stomach or something Anyways anyone have any input thoughts advice Thanks,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
I know what I want in life but everyone is shitting on me So a few years ago I got into producing and recording music I was stuck in a college degree I have learned to hate not in US so I didn t have to take on huge amounts of debt so I decided to drop out eventhough the likelihood of having a six figure income in the future would have been pretty much amp if I continued Since then I have been doing pretty much nothing but producing recording and engineering music But everyone that knows about this says I should be realistic about what I want and get into a different field I have gotten so obsessed with music that I spent around hours days a week getting better and building a catalog Reality is though that nobody really gives a shit I only know a hand full of people that really listened to my music and they figured that I am not the average joe getting into this because they know how long I have been doing this and seen the extremely fast pace that I am progressing at In fact the first song I have ever written and played for a few friends not telling them at first that it was my own the reaction was OMG you wrote that song You have to become a pro musician after telling them the that I actually wrote it That s how I figured out that I have a talent for songwriting My biggest problem right now is my parents trying to force me into some field I really dont give a damn about I told them that in a few years I will commit suicide if I am not able to establish myself as a full time recording artist producer The more I think about it the more I actually consider following through if I don t make the cut What really fuels all of these thoughts is the nihilistic perspective that I developed I really believe this might be the one and only opportunity to do what you want Who knows what will happen after death My parents say that I am selfish for thinking about suicide and I told them that I never asked to be born and automatically sign a contract to serve everyone else s selfish desires I also know that I don t want any kids so that they don t have to go through the whole process The only circumstance that I would ever consider becoming a parent would be if I actually achieved my dream So I don t have to get at them with that oh sorry nobody told you that you are basically screwed when you are born you don t really have that many choices in life and only a few lucky people get to live their dreams So wo man up Just climb the corporate ladder I don t believe in that mentality Unless you are physically not viable for your dream e g being a model or an NBA player I really do believe in the harder you work the luckier you get I have visited a psychiatrist and the only thing that I got was a prescription for Zoloft which I learned has nasty side effects Basically they are telling me Well do whatever you want just take these pills so that you can accept the reality you were born in eventhough you know that you hate it and are just numbing yourself with these pills I have not taken a single pill and most likely won t ever do it TLDR Dropped out of college no debt and found out what I really want to do in life Already putting in ridiculous work hours into my passion Family and friends are suggesting to go into a different direction because be realistic I set a suicide date in the future if dreams don t work out Got a prescription for Zoloft to basically numb my true self because be realistic,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

How do I go about dealing with poor mental healthThis is going to be a long post so if you read all the way through thank you The past two years I have been struggling with anxiety depression and bouts of suicidal ideation I was doing okay this past semester but these last few days have been really rough on my mental health and I planned out a suicide attempt which made me realize I desperately need help The suicide hotlines are useless and I was just denied online therapy I am a low income student so I of course do not have insurance and because I m only taking credits this semester I don t qualify for my schools mental health services I just don t know what to do I can t afford any sort of therapy I ve checked every nearby therapist and they re all over even with sliding fee scales and I don t qualify for insurance I just feel lost I don t have any family or friends to fall back on and this particular year has been awful on me Do any of you have some advice I m trying to get into law enforcement after graduation not policing so I m scared of being diagnosed with any sort of mental illness But at the same time I feel that therapy and possibly medication would really help However I don t even know where to start on that since I can t even pay for the initial appointment Any advice would be helpful Sorry for the rant and thank you for reading,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

My Mother Would be Happier if I was deadCollege senior Female Diagnosed with depression a few years back Even if I became the most successful person on Earth my mother wouldn t be happy with me Whenever we are alone my mother takes the opportunity to gaslight me until I cry She says me and my meds and therapy are too expensive and then gets mad at me for working my job so much I come home to visit and she s mad at me for not coming sooner so I leave her alone and then she gets mad at me for leaving her alone The one summer I stayed back at home I got so depressed that I became openly suicidal and my mother only cared that I didn t tell anyone in our family so she could keep up appearances I wasn t taken to a doctor until several months had passed When she asked why I feel she s always mad at me I name off times she s emotionally scarred me and instead of acknowledging that she hurt me she defends her actions as if she still thinks they were appropriate I don t have a rope yet but I ve begun considering to hang myself I know where I would do it I just often think I would be happier myself if I was dead and didn t have to hurt anymore,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

I feel unbearably lonelyHello well I ve been depressed since sophomore year October of I ve attempted suicide at least three times and was admitted to a psych institute February of I started feeling better but around the start of junior year I started to feel horrible again also my bf went back out with his ex girlfriend so that contributed to the depression I was raped in October and my parents found out so I got even sadder My boyfriend and I got back together which made things better for a little while But he never seems to care about whenever I m feeling sad or suicidal Whenever he s sad I do whatever I can to help But if I m crying or feeling hopeless he brushes it off So most of the time I just keep my feelings to myself Anyway it s on a daily basis that I find myself on the ground bawling nearly hyperventilating from crying so much I have literally no one to talk to about how I feel I don t cut anymore but I hit myself to feel some sort of relief My parents won t put me on antidepressants and my therapist doesn t help I m constantly fantasizing about my suicide I find comfort in planning it out in my head and I m also comforted by the fact that I could kill myself whenever I feel the need to I know I m young I know I have life ahead of me but I can t take daily breakdowns much longer It s becoming unbearable and I just feel physically exhausted from living I m not even completely sure why I posted here I guess because I used to find comfort in posting here old account and I even made a friend once I m sorry for all of the text I just needed a way to clear my head,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Running out of options and ideasI m just going to warn now that this is going to be a bit long I m really really sorry I m I lost my mom on Thanksgiving Nov of She had terminal cancer and the entire process of her getting extremely ill and dying traumatized me pretty badly She died when I was on the way to the hospice to see her so I didn t get to say goodbye Between that and a lot of other things I also carry a lot of guilt as well as trauma and grief revolving around her death Less than two months after she died we experienced a house fire and I lost my home and four pets I had This has caused me to reach a breaking point that s just been kind of ebb and flowing since mid January I have a lot of familiarity with suicidal ideation I ve been in and out of hospitals for suicidal thoughts attempts and self injury since I was Lost count of the amount of times I haven t been admitted since but I went a couple weeks ago for a screening Only a hospital that I have very bad experiences with had beds so I contracted to safety and signed out This was over fourth of July weekend so the lack of beds didn t surprise me I have borderline personality disorder pretty bad OCD and way before my mom passed I had already had PTSD from an abusive relationship rape in my early teens I can t hold down a job or go to school and I m on disability I was in DBT and getting a lot better before my mom got sick I ve also been off my meds since February I lost my medicaid because of a mistake social security made and getting it back has been really slow I go to individual therapy once a week and I like my therapist but I don t really trust him yet Living with my dad has been my worst nightmare since I was a little kid and because of me being so mentally ill I cannot afford to live on my own and am forced to live with him now we recently moved into an apartment He is extremely stubborn extremely volatile has always been pretty emotionally abusive and sometimes physically abusive and generally unwilling to deal with giving me the extra help I need because the chain of events since my mom s sickness and death has caused me to regress in terms of therapy progress He s not obligated to because I m an adult but I just feel so stuck He is also disabled and doesn t do anything all day and often if I so much as ask him a question I don t have a license and at my age most of my close friends work fulltime so I have few options to get away I have a caseworker but so far he s useless compared to my last one I can barely feed myself am having trouble with keeping on top of my hygiene and can hardly get out of bed just typical depression things Because of my lack of health insurance and medication I have been self medicating with cannabis but it doesn t even help anymore Despite this I can t stop because I m just too depressed to do anything else Besides my cat I have little else to keep going on except hope that my boyfriend will get here and we can get away from this sand I can get a fresh start We re a long distance relationship from different countries and various things have caused visa issues with him which adds even more stress and I just feel a sense of urgency because my entire life is just toxic right now Hopefully everything will be resolved soon and we can be together at least but I m running out of hope I m currently waiting to see if he ll skype with me About every other night I reach what feels like a breaking point like right now I have never been so miserable in my entire life I feel like if nothing changes soon I might attempt again Everything else that has driven me over the edge before seems petty compared to now I m basically just fighting with myself about whether or not I should just go back to the emergency room and just voluntarily sign myself inpatient and get it over with I m running out of options and I m even considering electroconvulsive therapy If my boyfriend can t find time to skype me tonight I may have to go to the ER soon as in within the next few hours but either way I will try to hold off until at least tomorrow I just don t know what to do anymore but I also don t know if the hospital can even help me at this point,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
First Draft of my Suicide NoteSo I posted earlier on here about my plans to go through with suicide and I m in the process of picking a good date to complete it It s weird to have strangers reading over what will be my final words on this earth but strangers are all I have right now so I am thankful for the people who can at least read over it and give some feedback Names are purposefully left out Hey everyone Hold onto your hats because this is going to get emotional I want to start out by saying that I m not angry Not at all I don t blame anyone for this and I take full responsibility for my actions I m not going to place the blame on other people or make tapes This is my fault I have left my depression untreated for an extremely long time and it got to a point where I could no longer get better It s too late I ve driven away everyone I cared about because of it and I don t blame them one bit for leaving I know a lot of people hate me for their own reasons I was a terrible secret keeper and I loved way too fast and sometimes I seemed crazy but I guess this actually confirms it I understand I hate me too I hope people can forgive me and look at this from a different light I tried the pills the therapists the self help guides It didn t work and now I don t care for it to work I m so tired of everything going on As some of you may know I was diagnosed with HSV which is herpes That diagnosis hit me pretty hard and then a short time later I was sextorted which means I sent explicit photos to someone and they threatened to send them to my family unless I sent more I had to comply I felt dirty and horrible A lot of people will probably think I m selfish and if that helps you get over this then think that But I promise I m just tired and I m trying to do what is truly best for me I didn t mean to make anyone hurt and I am truly sorry to the few people who actually cared about me When I m gone I don t want a fancy funeral or costly ceremonies I m perfectly alright with being forgotten My sister has access to my Facebook now so if you want to save some special memories then delete the account go ahead I am certainly not someone to be remembered and I don t want people going on about how much they miss me in death when they never cared to show it in my life The same people who had no problem abandoning me before should have no problem with my absence I don t want to hear apologies or sympathies I m dead It does no good to me now that you showed up I would like the funeral to be family and a few close friends if any feel like attending I understand if you don t want to go and you should feel no guilt if you miss it I made this to to let people know that I made this choice and that I wholeheartedly believed it to be the best one There is a huge burden that will be off my shoulders and I honestly can t wait I m ready to finally commit to this and although I will miss so many people namely my mom my sister and my Dad I just know that this had to happen Now I can finally be okay I hope everyone can come to forgive me some day I love you all Me,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

What the hell do I do Hello This has taken me time I gather that this is not a very well read subreddit but I don t where else to post I am on the brink I do not want to be here any more however I do not deserve to be depressed I should be happy with my life but I want to die This makes me feel worse Here comes by story All my life I have been one of those mildly popular guys Never have I belonged to the elite of those popular but neither have I ever had to feel a lack of friends and neither have I have had to search for friend In short having friends have always been a given for me and I have even had friends who expressed jealousy because I had it all I had smarts I always had top grades in school yet I had friends among the cool kids and I always had girls However about half a year ago I started feel like shit I went on a trip with my then girlfriend We went to Cuba for vacation which we could afford because she worked in the travel industry and we could get very cheep tickets On the way there on then very flight I started to feel extremely nauseous bordering on unbearable nausea but we were only some minutes from landing so I pulled through When we arrived I didn t feel better and my nausea kept on albeit at a diminishing rate After a few days I felt fine Back home Sweden I felt almost fine but I would start having these bouts of nausea while at work These would sometimes result in me having to go home from work After a while with this I saw no other option than to go to a doctor This doctor told me that what I expressed seemed like nothing but stress I accepted this diagnosis as I at the time was very stressed out as I had my master s thesis and my work at the same time so I decided to wait things out Eventually my master thesis was finished and I passed and I had only my work to deal with But my nausea never ended At one time me and my then girlfriend went to the south of Sweden to go to a party This would normally entail two hours of train but because of whatever fuckup the train was cancelled and we had to go by bus I took extremely ill during the busride At the time I thought it was common motion sickness but I have never in my life previously been motion sick and I grew up on boats and on cars I shouldn t suffer from motion sickness Nevertheless I ascribed my sickness to motion sickness but I fell ill for more than two weeks Luckily we caught a ride with a car back to our home town which was horrible but better than a bus ride but back home I didn t get better so I finally started to think my ailment was psychosomatic After this I would frequently have bouts of what I can only describe as anxiety My doctor prescribed hydroxine to me which helped momentarily and I am on it now as I write and I feel fine My relationship with my girlfriend finally ended as she went on a semester abroad I felt nothing but relief as I could finally focus on my self I no longer had her to think of I contend that the failure of our relationship was due to my constant depression and not to her leaving I was supposed to go with her but just couldn t Here s the bad part As single I ve been extremely successful I ve constantly have had girls I ve slept around and I have even had offers for long term relationships Yet I have never been happy I have been extremely unhappy I am extremely unhappy I write this from a throwaway but any one of my friends who happen upon this post can easily identify from my circumstances My point is I am extremely unhappy I return home from having been offered to sleep with a girl yet still I did not want to i seriously do not believe it to be related to my former relationship I simply do not want to live any more I am severely depressed I suffer from random bouts of nausea and anxiety which I personally subscribe wholly to something psychosomatic Still I am very much aware of the fact that I do not deserve to be unhappy I have everything going for me I have a great education and girls throw themselves at my feet yet whatever happens I want to die I return tonight from a night on the town that resulted in at least two offers of coitus but I want to die I always want to die I usually am not suicidal I have no wish to end my own life I just wish to die But tonight something was different I think it was because I met an old crush of mine and my failure to ever get with her got to me but never the less tonight was the first time I ever wanted to end my life I am fully aware that the above text does nothing but convince people that I should not even be depressed But that is my problem I am so fucking depressed and the fact that I know I shouldn t be just makes things worse I hate myself for being depressed and I think I should just man up and so thinks everyone I ve told about my troubles But it doesn t work I am so fucking depressed and for the first time ever I want to end it all I just cried and I don t know why I want to die I just want to die so badly but I don t

his disappointed yet calm voice saying you re not going to die idk how but i hung up i don t remember much after but i know i took the other half and blacked out with no other memory of what happened i have videos of me on snap talking to myself saying shit like i don t have any real friends when i woke up my head was killing me and my cut was still bleeding w yellow shit coming out of it too i was really worried of infection the night before my dad saw my cut and just put triple anti biotic and medical tape on it so that s what i did for days i told some online friends and they were really worried especially my boyfriend they all were telling me to go to my parents and get stitches but i didn t have enough strength to the first day the days passed and i was getting worried yellow shit

hurt sometimes she decided the best thing was to get my parents i was panicking and didn t want to do i got her to get them downstairs they asked if i did it to myself i said yes they began yelling at me fueled with anger my dad was squeezing my arm and touching my cuts that hurt like hell my mom was the most angry i held back tears but their yelling is what made me cry she was cursing at me making

asked friends and strangers if it looked infected and read how to keep it clean there was still puss coming out which wasn t normal i asked my mom but she blew it off i didn t know what to do but keep cleaning it i slept in my sisters room that night the next day my day had bought spray on liquid bandage that i ve never heard of i found out later it should be used for minor cuts he sprayed it inside of the cut i have a high pain tolerance but i almost cried he kept pinching my cuts i told him i could do it but he kept denying it i put on more medical tape and it hurt all day i regret telling them so much my friend recommended calling suicide hotline to get cps involved but i couldn t do that to my younger sister so i never did ive been feeling pretty empty even right now my cuts

I am tired I am tired of trying TLDR I hate myself Trauma Depression Bipolar Anxiety I want to kill myself but I can t bring myself to do it I ll start off by saying that I most likely delete this post sometime after posting it I guess I just need to get some stuff out I am years old I m working full time in a career that I worked very hard for A job which brings me much financial security and in some ways brings me some semblance of fulfillment I have an amazing boyfriend who loves me and wants to marry me I have a few good friends I have access to mental health care and support But I still want to die As a kid I grew up in a family of alcoholics and drug users My dad died when I was years old and I grew up with many of my most fond memories of him being drunk and trying to break into the house he broke into the house twice actually My uncle then died of drug and alcohol use On top of that my mom was also an alcoholic and I suffered through years of psychological mental and verbal abuse I frequently have recall memories of my mom yelling at me about how fucked up I was Or how I was fat and ugly Or how I was a bitch Or how I was a slut I was gaslit I was made to believe for a long time that my life with my mom was perfect and I was the one making things difficult by being a drama queen My mom rarely let me leave the house aside from school or going to the grocery store Her being a protective parent did not allow people to pick me up friends or parents so I spent much of my time alone on the weekends and during summer For a long time my mom was one of the few people I hung out with and really she was my best and only friend for years she was my entire life I had no one else It was use against the world During my teenage years I began to show signs of anxiety depression and bipolar looking back on it I can see where I showed signs of bipolar disorder but I was never diagnosed I began self harming and thought of killing myself I would take copious amounts of sleeping pills to sleep and be in a fog during my school days A few times I took more than pills in an attempt to kill myself obviously it did not work High school was some of the worst years of my life I did not think I would make it to the age of years old Now I m I hate my job the job I was supposed to love so much My job brings so much stress and anxiety I no longer see why I went into the field My administration make me want to scream They make my life worse My job makes my life worse I wake up every morning dreading that I have to work My boyfriend is great but I know he deserves so much better Who wants to be with someone as fucked as me Who has baggage like I do My past affects me so deeply and affects my behavior which affects him I have few friends I feel like I am living for my boyfriend but like I said he deserves so much more I want to be everything for him but I do not know if I ever will be I feel guilty because I do have a good life but I still want to die I want to die I want to stop hearing my mom s voice in my head I want to stop being a burden to everyone I want to cease to exist and I want everyone who loves me to move on and find other better people to fill my space in their lives someone more deserving of that space I m struggling with the fact that I made it to my th year it feels so weird to have made it when I thought I would be dead by It s jarring to say the least I don t know how I am supposed to make it any further The future seems so dark and bleak Honestly I don t even see a future for myself I don t deserve to live I am a burden on this earth I just need the courage to do it I apologize to anyone if this post seems rambling I just needed to get this out,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

I m literally hopeless and will end my life in a few daysYes I fucking am There is no hope for me I m sick rn not covid tho and despite that will cut myself anyway I ve lived in a mental hospital for two years I have tried all the kind of therapies they specifically have to offer I m sixteen and we already started trying antidepressants for adults bc I tried the ones that kids are allowed to get already Nothing worked I am almost at the highest dose and after that they can t help me try other ones bc they don t have enough experience My problems are now too complex and heavy for them and they have no other options for me to try therapies again I ve already had for years without success I told them over two months ago I wanted to switch completely and go to another place where they have more therapies and meds I can try and where they are completely focused on ppl like me With chronic severe and complex problems Because at the place I m treated at rn that s just very often not the case so they really lacked acute and good help the first few months They told me they would talk ab it with my parents and me TWO MONTHS later and I told them everything was getting worse and to be able to go in conversation with them my mental health shouldn t worsen I asked them for more temporarily more intense help but they never came back to me so i was left with medication appointments and therapy sessions that didn t help And as i thought everything took a turn for the absolute worst I got worse and worse and i was falling back in all of my bad behaviors and coping mechanisms I cut deeper than ever before didn t do anything and started interacting with my anorexia again that had actually been pushed away and not that bad for the past few months I had the convo a few days ago I didn t want anything because i wanted to die more than ever They said they needed me if i wanted other therapy I told them i didn t want it anymore and i wanted to die They suggested i got admitted to the mental hospital again which is basically of my trauma s I got mad They know that Some of staff treaded me very poorly and multiple friends died there literally doors away from my room They forced me to go inpatient after that and i begged them to send me to another hospital if i had to be on a closed ward everything was better than there But that was too complicated for them So yeah when i got discharged because they couldn t fix me i swore i wouldn t go back ever So they told me if i wanted to be admitted somewhere else i could wait six months Nice thanks Its always so funny they tell me that when i say i want to die and tell them alright fine i ll fk die than And actually attempt And then somehow they have the courage to say wow we were unpleasantly surprised and didn t see this coming LMFAO and THEN i am suddenly transported as soon as im physically ok to the first closed ward with watch Sorry for rhis long rant with bad english I just am so done I tried to tell them i was not ok I tried to ask for help two months ago and again two days ago The only thing bringing me some peace in my mind are self harm and my cat And i tried to hold on for my cat because she means everything to me and for everyone that loves me because i know damn well what its like to lose ppl to suicide But i can t I can t i just can t I can t go to school next year I can t go on a waiting list of six months and i can t go on this way My plan takes multiple days unfortunately and it started yesterday so i have to wait spend my time cuddling with my cat and self harming I doubt wether i should tell my best friend we have an agreement that if the other will end it we will say goodbye and not inform anyone until after I don t wanna lay the burden on her shoulders but otherwise I would ve give everything to have had a chance to say go the ppl i lost I would ve kept it a secret if it meant i could be on the phone with them until they passed I can t bare the idea of them having been so alone God that haunts me the most Knowing they were all alone when they died I don t know guess that s gonna be the last harsh decision to make,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

I m alone in every possible way and I just wish someone could be there for me I have not been diagnosed with anything The way I am is just normal for my age I m but everything just sucks I have a few friends from elementary but now in middle school I talk to them less and less and keep finding myself distancing from them We rarely have anything in common and I have to fake react everything Even if I did have great friends at school just the thought of being with them outside of school is scary and I hate that feeling I want to be alone but I hate feeling alone I just go along with everything to make it quick Everyday I wake up in bed and can barely force myself out of bed I can t bring myself to worry about showering brushing my teeth going to the bathroom or doing important homework unless it al gets really bad I want to be in my small crappy room listening to music where it is my only outlet School work has been driving me crazy and I can t even complete anything because I m so stupid I get distracted and can t focus clearly during class When I even miss any part of the lesson whether it s my fault or not I start to panic because I worry about my grades Missing class is my biggest fear and if I do I get mad at myself and injure myself without even realizing it I hit cut scratch and stab my self with anything that s near me Luckily nothing has ever left a scar except this one time out of rage I worry about my grades so much and can t even accept B s yet I give up during the work I can t keep up with it all because they hand out so many big projects and although we have enough time I always wait until last minute I don t ask for help from anyone because I don t want them to think lower of me or seen as a failure but I can t count on anyone else to help It always has to be my way Why There s more reasons but I m just tired at this point I ve been having these suicidal thoughts around two years ago yet haven t started injuring since earlier this month because of a pack of blades I found in my molds drawer thanks mom I can t wait until I m older and just drive away and let go of myself completely I first hesitated because I didn t want to hurt my lol form my sisters passing but at this point I m desperate I tried to reach out to her because I may have had social anxiety but nothing is ever done She forces me to go out now so I will face my fear and it will eventually fade with age but I ve been this way forever One day hopefully I ll get my shit together I ll get a job as soon as possible and save up to get an affordable job I ll ride that baby up to Fred Hartman Bridge and just look at the view And then I will let go Nothing will hold me back,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Very calm now yet I m still done I know I have a history of irrational and suicidal thoughts I m convinced that I am bipolar with mixed episodes though I ve never been diagnosed I m used to the racing thoughts and self loathing and I ve called the suicide hotline before in those acute situations I ve been working on my calmness lately meditating and working on developing mental self discipline Apparently I m good at it I can drop my heart rate at will using only a relaxing thought now But the thought of suicide persists and now it has become a very calm very rational thought Before it was I can t get through the night feeling this way which was of course untrue it was tough but I got through all those difficult nights Now it has become a very rational I have nothing to look forward to that s worth the numbness I have to feel to get there Background Lower middle class white male I know I m just the worst believe me I squandered much of my youth because of bad luck and depression lost my job in right before the crash and stayed mostly unemployed for five years Never went to college even though that would have been the perfect opportunity my parents had the money to help me out I was just too depressed and obsessed with the notion that it would end soon and I would be back on my feet Finally got a job a few years back nothing special but it was full time and not a month in the girl I had dated for six years the love of my life and the only person I ve ever felt like I could connect with on every level dumped me only to reveal afterwards that she had been abducted raped and left in a parking lot two years before and she d been living with the weight of that event solely on her shoulders ever since She d never told a soul never went to the hospital or police or therapy just tried to live her life like normal until it finally crushed her I tried to be there for her and for my trouble I got to see her getting into escorting violent and degrading sex drinking and other destructive behavior She broke into my house one night for a booty call and made me hit her and hurt her and say cruel things to her and I did it because I wanted her in my life in any way but I felt horrible violated and told her I couldn t do it again We lost touch after she attacked me in my house one night destroyed several priceless possessions and called the cops to tell them I was responsible I only barely avoided jail She s a cam girl still and I follow her even though it hurts just to see how she is She s doing okay now emotionally and I consider that a blessing I still love her and I always will After that I got into drugs drank a lot tried to destroy myself I got into many bar fights had a lot of promiscuous sex including two affairs with friends who were in long term relationships that I almost ruined I let myself be raped by two co workers male and female because I felt like I deserved it after what had happened to my ex You might not consider it rape I never said no but I let things happen that I didn t want and that made me feel violated As a result of that I was left with persistent intrusive thoughts that have left me impotent with lovers until I tell them what happened basically a death sentence for casual sex I moved across the country last year to try to escape my past and start over and it hasn t worked As much as I work on myself my relationships with people seem to go the same way I have no trouble finding friends I m pretty charming one on one but I can t seem to keep them around I have no terrible attracting women but they all seem to get spooked a few months into the relationship I feel like my baggage is too much or that it makes me incapable of accepting their love I just broke up with a girl and even though we dated for only three months I felt such a strong connection I told her everything and she not only accepted it she had some stories of her own Every moment we were together I felt alive again but for various reasons relating to her social awkwardness I didn t get a good introduction to her social circle and I think she didn t feel like I could be a long term part of her life That triggered a spiraling depression for me that only bolstered her resolve to push me out of her life This has happened so many times It just all seems so pointless I know I ll find new friends but they won t stay long I know I ll find new lovers but they ll all leave me with nothing special to remember them by I want nothing more than a life that feels meaningful where I can build a history with the people I love but I feel like I m just on an endless conveyer belt of meaningless relationships I feel like there must be something inherently wrong with me and that the panic attacks will never go away and that they ll all get spooked and I ll just be jumping from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship forever until I m too old to fuck and then I ll die I turn in a week and I ve spent every one of the last five birthdays alone I m just so tired and I don t see a point in being here anymore except to spare my friends and family the trouble I think suicide is inevitable and I think about it in such rational terms but there s some little quiet voice inside if me that wants me to believe there s hope That voice is getting easier to ignore every day,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress

How to help my best friend with her depression suicidal thoughts My roommate is my best friend of almost years and we have lived together for about a year now We have both always struggled with depression but she struggled with suicidal thoughts a lot more than I did and she has been to multiple therapists and has been on medication since she was a teenager She hasn t seen a therapist in over years so she s been on the same low dose Zoloft prescription since then She was also admitted to the hospital on suicide watch when were in high school She has always been very adamant about the fact that she is going to kill herself at some point in her life and how she doesn t care if she dies When we talk about anything related to death car accidents coronavirus murder etc she will bring up how she doesn t care at all if she dies and she welcomes it Today she had about shots and we got into an argument about it because she was saying some concerning things about drinking about how she could drink the whole bottle and she would be fine it was a liter bottle and doesn t care at all if it damaged her organs cus she s gonna die at some point anyways And when I proved to her on the internet that it would kill her she just shrugged and said it s ok if I drink it all it s because I want to die and then I started to get upset and she said don t worry I would never kill myself if you were going to still be alive and be sad about it but if you died or something then I would probably go for it She says that she has just always felt like this and no matter what I say in return she refuses to say anything other than I know my brain and I know that it won t ever change I told her she needs to go back to therapy and even offered to pay for it but she said that she s been to years of therapy and already knows exactly what they ll say so there s no point I told her it s not normal to feel that way for your whole life We argued about it for a while and she just says the same thing over and over and over again I know my brain completely and I know it will never change Over and over it s her only argument I don t know what to do She had an incident a few months ago where she got really really close to attempting suicide and she didn t tell me until the next morning and yet she claims now that if she was at a point where she was thinking about it then of course she would tell me But she didn t before so I don t know what to think Thanks in advance I don t really know what to do,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Please help me make sense of my reality I don t know why I m writing this post except thatI m really really really in pain and on the verge of giving up I m years old I miss being myself being kind positive and bubbly I feel like the best parts of me are dead I also feel weak and fragile I grew up in a picture perfect family my dad was my best friend My biggest problem was losing weight and having a critical mom My parents had a great marriage my grandparents from my dad s side and from my mom s side were my biggest supporters I moved to a new country because my younger sister had autism spectrum disorder there was nothing in our country to support her so when I was my brother and my sister my mom left her job family and home to move to a developed country for my sister Apparently with therapy she could get better My dad remained back to work and support us abroad Financials this was when dad suddenly made it very big Also dad has a brother his wife my aunt and two children cousin is older than me and cousin is younger than my brother In the past year and a half these things have happened to me and these are the mistakes I made Dad started becoming distant Right after we left his mother conspired to get uncle to join my father s business uncle wasn t doing so well Mother was unhappy said she should just give him money Not have to work together As predicted by my mother and her mother fast forward years and Father is bankrupt with tonnes in the millions in debt that his brother took in his name Dad started a whole new business had everything on paper and handed it to uncle Slowly uncle got in more and more of his friends Father cannot and will not stand up to brother Every time he tries uncle calls his mother who calls my dad and psychologically abuses him SO much that my father gives in Father had to go to jail for a day for all this debt At one point dad was paying tuition for uncle s son while I was taking loans Extended family I grew up with as a result all hate dad now because he s not rich isn t giving them all free money owes them money Dad cheated on my mom this is ultimately what broke me in the years he had been away I watched their perfect beautiful marriage disintegrate Uncle and grandma probably really contributed to this I listened to mother cry on Skype for months like every other day straight What I would give to never have heard the stuff she said She read his text messages to other woman she also talked about her sexual life OMG She doesn t have many friends therapy is frowned upon in our culture so she cried to me And I listened Found out my grandfather dad s dad was a rapist He apparently approached my uncle s wife who then disconnected from my family As a result of which my grandma was so desperate for the two brothers to be working together Mom s mom is alone and struggling because she only had my mom and dad My dad hates her even though she tried to help him due to brainwashing from his own mother And my mother is incapable of being supportive so they have a conflict and I am stuck in between My mom s kidneys are not working like only percent so I ve been trying to convince her to take one of mine The constant implication is if she dies her two kids are my responsibility not her husbands My best friend who I was in love with broke up with his girlfriend And I took care of him We were pseudo dating everyone thought we were together I didn t want to push him because he just broke up RIGHT when my family fell apart he decides he met a girl in the library and loves her and they are dating He loves me but he loves her more because with me he does not feel carnal feelings I came to terms with the fact that I had been sexually assaulted as a child in my grandfather s house by a guy who worked there For years I kept thinking I wasn t pure and would never be enough for a guy A few days after this happened I think I was my grandmother mom s mom asked me if anyone had been near my vagina I said yes I don t know what she did after with this realization and the rejection I felt a lot of need to prove something to sex so I hooked up with guys and had sex with one off the internet He was nice and consensual made me feel good about myself but just dumped me as he got back with his girlfriend I started supporting myself more and more financially and it s been hard But I recognize it s worse for so many people TODAY haven t talked to dad properly in months I think he has PTSD cannot reconcile him and grandparents and uncle s family who loved me and supported me as a child Mom is dependant on me in some ways and its nice and suffocating I feel this weight on my shoulder of responsibility which I plan to take This is all that comes to mind I ve kept going because of good friends and this belief that if I keep working hard I ll get somewhere But recently my sister has been diagnosed with epilepsy and that made me so depressed As a child of immigrants I feel no identity Couldn t hold on to my religion lost all family back home don t fit in there when I go back home now the sexism pains and I feel like an outsider in my country where I ambling now which I feel will never accept me as me Please give me some perspective articles or tangible advice I m struggling so much SO MUCH TLDR Bankruptcy familial estrangement sexual assault sick mother infidelity

I am scared shitless of schizophreniaFirst off I d like to apologize for the wall of text You can skip most of it up until the tl dr mark without missing much Secondly I d like to thank you for giving a shit about a complete stranger on the internet You guys often do a thankless job but I love every single one of you It all started years ago when I was I began experiencing unhealthy amounts of anxiety in social situations my grades were failing and I ended up with a mild form of depression The only thing I looked forward to was coming back home to play video games I shrugged it off as a temporary problem that would go away on it s own but as the years went by more symptoms added themselves into the mix as the old ones became even more obvious I had less and less motivation to do anything I began having more and more suicidal ideations I stopped taking care of my body wouldn t shower shave brush my teeth or put day clothes on except if I had to get out of the house which was rare My parents initially thinking I was just being lazy eventually changed their minds and became very supportive of my troubles They took me to a psychiatrist Here s where it gets confusing He diagnoses me with some form of schizophrenia and immediately puts me on an anti psychotic Risperdal mg day Heart problems massive weight gain pounds in a month panic attacks extreme drowsiness It didn t seem worth it considering this type of AP does nothing to suppress negative symptoms I keep pestering him about the side effects until he finally decides to switch my medication to Abilify another AP that causes me very similar issues He seemed puzzled by all this told me he s never had a patient feel drowsy on a low dosage of Abilify and concluded that I might very well be causing those side effects to myself that if he was to give me a placebo and convince me that it was an anti psychotic I would feel all this He urges me to keep taking an anti psychotic any anti psychotic Fast forward a month or two of switching between the two meds and finding both of them unbearable I tell him I stopped taking them I beg him to reconsider his diagnosis of schizophrenia that maybe the medication isn t doing anything good because I am not psychotic He redirects me to a psychologist who makes me take a Rorschach and a Thematic Apperception Test The guy concludes that I scored like a schizophrenic would and that it was indeed very important that I take my medication without which I could have a psychotic breakdown at any time I think that s the point where I realized I was massively fucked Up until then I managed to tell myself that this schizophrenia diagnosis was just a joke I would play along with on the off chance it was true but somehow having those test results explained to me made the threat very real I ended up doing a lot of research on schizophrenia and apparently every psychotic breakdown will rot your brain from the inside Lowers your cognitive functions including your intelligence every single time No amount of medication or therapy can ever fix the damage done tl dr I attempted suicide a few months back after realizing what fate had in store for me by overdosing on my medication Since then I feel like a piece of shit because my mother is terrified of losing me and has told me on multiple occasions that if I go she goes I don t want to turn into a fucking vegetable I don t want to lose grip on reality I d rather not exist and the only thing keeping me alive right now is knowing that I would hurt my family even more than I m doing now by being a useless fuckup but that last resort is now being tested After visiting a day hospital for group activities the psychiatrist in charge spent half an hour explaining to me just how I m a ticking time bomb who s going to lose control I don t know if you guys can wrap your head around the concept of losing the essence of what makes you a person but it s very very scary I would much MUCH rather die I don t want this piece of shit schizophrenia I ve never had a hallucination in my damn life I consider myself a rationalist and a skeptic I ve never had funky beliefs or delusions I don t do drugs nobody in my family has schizophrenia I never expected I d have to deal with this one day I want to fucking die It s all I think about I can t take a bath without wanting to drown I can t be in a car without thinking of jumping out I keep spontaneously coming up with ideas on how I should end myself H S hypothermia shotgun hanging drug overdose and alcohol I feel like shit I don t want to see myself becoming insane As of today nothing not even their precious anti psychotics can guarantee that I won t slip up at one point in my life To sum up my current situation one of my doctors told me that if we liken someone s personality to a crystal mine is cracked It s not broken yet but the smallest event could destroy it and there s no way to fix it I m sorry if this is difficult to read I haven t had much sleep and I feel like absolute shit,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Here s my rant about being miserable and depressed It helps to write it out even if it makes me cry more Basically everyone but my boyfriend and parents think I m pretty much fine including my professors school friends My boyfriend knows I m extremely depressed and suicidal and my parents know I m as bad as I was when I was which implies the same My therapist probably knows I m suicidal but I promised myself years ago when it was this bad before I d never go to a mental hospital again voluntarily because it s extremely traumatic for me I stopped seeing her because I don t want her to involuntarily commit me Specifically going between now and early January is an over my dead body type option because I ve been procrastinating grad school applications and need to finish them all by early January Going to the mental hospital literally rips away my support system and coping mechanisms completely such as talking to my boyfriend going on Reddit playing video games listening to people on discord sleeping as much as I want eating food I like etc The hospital also makes it so I might not be able to graduate from college on time or get bad grades which would mean I d have to reapply to graduate programs which would be enough to make me actually do it I m a good student and have a and a in my major which is great I have a really competitive internship in my field of study lined up for the spring in addition to my prior related work experience I love my field and feel like I m actually helping people My professors love me and almost all of them are willing to give me a letter of recommendation for grad school which is great The problem is no one would fucking believe that I m constantly suicidal and taking a semester off isn t an option I have a disability hearing or whatever it s called in March I m scared it s going to come out that I m very suicidal and I ll be sent off to the hospital again Like I m in a catch be re traumatized and potentially have to go to the hospital again and not graduate on time or have them not understand the gravity of the situation The guy who s the judge clearly doesn t get mental health stuff in my opinion based on previous times I ve talked with him It s like either go full NEET be hospitalized not regulate myself and they take me seriously or try to make a future for myself and be less suicidal and they don t take me seriously at all Being able to hold down easy credits of coursework that requires maybe hours of work a day and hrs a week internship isn t the same as being able to hold down a hour a week job My boyfriend is fucking incredible and the most supportive person aside from my parents I ve ever met I can t imagine life without him The problem is I feel so utterly inadequate because he has a physical disability that makes it so I have to do a lot of the chores like taking out the trash doing dishes etc yet I have fucking meltdowns that I can t control like crying fits if I m asked to do almost anything most of the time I get so short with him and lose it over tint stuff because I m so constantly miserable It s not intentional at all and I love him so much and do my best to be supportive of him I m so afraid of losing him yet I can t fucking control myself He can work and stuff thankfully at least and works in a well paying industry that he is really talented at I ve probably gained lbs in years easily from depression eating I went from pretty toned hourglass shape lifting weights x a week and walking tons around lbs at and about a size to now maybe a size x and lbs I m covered in unappealing stretch marks I haven t brushed my hair in a month or two so it s extremely tangled and knotted I struggle to brush my teeth I wear dirty clothes for weeks at a time I shower maybe once every three weeks I wish I was kidding I have very little interest in sex or anything like that but I try to at least once a week initiate something with my boyfriend because I don t want him to leave me He basically says it s not necessary to do this but I just don t want him to leave me I have a lot of weed because I m in a legal state temporarily and it s one of the only things that helps I don t take other medication because since covid I literally can t remember to especially not twice a day Also the old medication made me have shitty side effects like being difficult to orgasm sleep hrs a day made me extremely nauseous and didn t really help that much with my mood I ve tried basically every medication in the book I have a really weird case and rarely get concrete diagnoses I think I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder if I had to guess after being a former psych major for a while plus the diagnosis I ve heard from former psychiatrists But I ve also been encouraged to be tested for autism by a psychiatrist which I also think could explain a ton That s basically how I ve been doing It kinda helped a little to write out my feelings so thank

I m dying youngLife is pointless I am years old stuck with the mentality of years old and I can t go back to being a child My parents are old and when they die I am out of this place I m scared as hell of death but the only consolation I have is not to die on nature s terms I refuse waking up around my in the middle of the night to be afraid of death If immortality would be worked on then I would be a little bit calmer since it s not oh well I will opt out for euthanasia and then cryofreeze myself in hopes I might see another century where society cares to cure death I am so depressed I realize that my potential was wasted and it will continue being wasted because I just can t do anything I wish my mom had me a bit later I would have friends better school better life but she didn t have me later and now I barely even see the end of this century Thanks to death I can t find anything meaningful in life my relationship with my boyfriend is basically gone since I can t bring myself to care about him since when he dies then I would deal with shit ton of pain I can t take care of myself nor I even want to I can barely wake up in the morning I am seeing therapist I have tons of pills nothing helps,"Mental Distress, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium
I feel so hopelessI m next month and I can t remember a time before I was depressed my grades are low because I skip school when my suicidal thoughts make it too hard to get up I don t think I ll get good enough grades to get into university next year and I feel like I ve wasted all the opportunities I ve had I m autistic and no one around me puts in any effort to understand me when I was younger I genuinely thought I was an alien because nothing made sense Everything feels so so much harder than it should be but apparently because I m academically clever I should be able to cope I ve tried therapy and various antidepressants but it s so easy to just spiral back into being suicidal I have a plan for how to do it and I ve researched everything I think everyone around me would be happier in the long term if I wasn t there,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
i want to preempt thisi ll be brief because frankly i don t care anymore within a few days few hours or something like that the absolute love of my life is going to tell me that she feels nothing for me anymore she woke up one day and everything was different in her mind including me her loving mate we never fought we got along perfectly we matched in all the right places we were deeply and madly in love we opened up new worlds for one another it made life worth living and it s going to end i didn t do anything to cause it but that doesn t matter in the end so the question is what can i do to avoid killing myself i don t like the idea of antidepressants my pointless pride prevents me from getting a therapist i ve been through an awful depression before and i almost killed myself there this one is already several magnitudes worse and it hasn t even really started yet i don t know what to do,"Mental Distress, Progress Update",Medium
Just want to share these past couple days with you allEarly hours Thursday morning my nana attempted suicide She ODed on a mixture of prescription drugs and paracetamol My aunt checked on her a few hours later found her collapsed beside her bed she had been sick and was unconscious Eye bleeding from where she knocked her head on her beside table She had rosary beads and my grandads pocket watch in her hand Two ambulances arrived and took her away There was a carrier bag of empty medicine packets A bit of background My Nan has attempted this before she myself and many other members of my family have suffered varying levels of depression at different times for different reasons My Nan turns this year She was witty active creative and thoughtful She was diagnosed with terminal fibrosis of the lungs months ago and her quality of life declined rapidly more than we had realised The paramedics on a rd attempt managed to revive her and she was put into Critical Intensive Care Since then I ve witnessed the raw shock and emotion from my family members When only weeks ago I had considered suicide again I related to her so much but from a totally different perspective Her chances of survival were next to none primarily because her lungs were too weak but there was also brain damage from the minutes she was unresponsive in the ambulance I don t know why I m writing this out I don t exactly have a point but it s pushed me away from suicide for now I understand Nan truly I do She is still in hospital her lungs expected to give out some time tonight For the brief time she was conscious and able to get some words out to us she apologised As incredible the technology and the teams are that brought my Nan back for a brief amount of time I really believe that if somebody is mentally capable of choosing to end their life especially when faced with a terminal illness we should let them go I would ve done the same There s much more I can talk about more of my nans last words all the differing views of my family some want to cover up the fact there was a suicide attempt but that just adds to the stigma This discussion is necessary Whatever I m tired Self harming still but suicide has been pushed back for another time,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
somebody its not that i am killing myself right now but the direction i am heading is not good it will be a matter of time so any suggestion would be appreciated tldr These are my weird and bizarre thoughts and stories so far I know these are very poor mentality thoughts but it is true what i feel Now i realised that back when i was in school i have somewhat OCD I used to align carpets symmetrically and books in order idk why but i used to do it Grade diagnosed with sinusitis and eye problem and later migraine went to several hospitals everything became okay within months From childhood I was a lonely type small family and less talkative introvert but I used to play and it s very good Grade okay I used to align the bedsheet properly and wash leg frequently sometimes but it went in week In Grade I chose mathematics instead of biology idk why seeing others and thinking I cannot do and takes a huge amount of time and money idk if i had interest in anything at all had slight interest in becoming a doctor slight cause i have seen them working closely and it seems so reputed profession and all Sometimes I have irritability problems can t resist loud voices and sometimes even bad weather can affect my mood my mood depends on external factors My performance depends on external factors Now grade a deep voice constantly argues that u should have gone there that is your goal u came here seeing others and all and somewhere i feel i cheated myself Grades are good Everything is good Now I have started making few friends Cannot even connect to people Hoping Nobody likes me and all Some days I felt so alone too I did the entrance examination and I did well But now in college i feel more alone more lost that i don t even know where I am i am not feeling good Before even starting my career I am feeling I cannot I cheated myself I am not good I know nothing then idk why i became anxious I feel people are judging me i feel people dont like me i am not smart and this is a complete new field which might be to some extent true And i am running from myself Can t make genuine friends Confidence none self respect shattered Idk i feel i dont have good friends And i am becoming toxic Grade is not bad so far but i am not even close to what i could have done I am totally not happy i feel so lost so alone there are people around me but I feel lost And No everything is not okay I never sent a resume Because i don t think I am even worthy Even when some people ask me with care I feel i dont deserve anything good I should not be happy people don t like me My close friends dont like me This is a different field and i know nothing Day by day my self hatred grows I feel i am cheating on myself and i am fake I hardly go to relatives Because I feel i am not good enough smart enough I am not worthy I have let down its like i am hiding something and i don t want to go there its like i am not good and they wont like me And I feel so alone so lost let down and everything the more i try the more i go down i feel i dont have friends I cannot do anything amp i am done The college experience is so bad that i dont even want to appear i want an escape Now i dont want to code read write and all i just want to sleep all day and sometimes i wish i werenot even born I never applied to companies cause i dont even know what i am doing I cannot imagine my future it feels like i am just moving or doing this in just the shake of doing there is no extra hours and deep interest And at times i feel so irritated so angry that i don t like the place i don t like to code now feels like i am totally done then sometimes I think about fate palmistry existential crisis and all I feel so lost and isolated and sometimes i don t even know who i am i feel judged and people would find out No everything is not okay I am not feeling good not even a day i don t have proper skill i cannot connect with friends and i am done with fake smile i am done with faking i am not having good experience at all and when i see my parents and other ppl thinking he is smart and all Sometimes i burst into tears Not a thing is okay its not okay i have told for quite a few years that it will be okay but it is still the same i feel unconfident about me I am constantly let down I cannot do things I want to isolate myself Now sometimes I think I cannot learn anything I wont get a job I don t think how long i can bear like this sometimes I feel I am in huge trouble sometimes everything seems fine But I constantly swing back and forth between these emotions these days Now when I see myself i feel so sorry for myself Sorry for my parents If only I had no parents I would have quitted already It is okay from outside but it is not okay at all I feel so fucked up trapped and i don t think i can change anything how can I i don t have proper motivation I don t even know what i am doing who i am going to be where I am I hate myself and i don t think i can change anything constant thoughts that u are not good u cannot do anything The thing you are doing is quite not meaningful You dont like it You are so boring You just dont know it and all And the biggest problem is now i dont want to do it i have no motivation i dont want to do anything That feeling when you feel so lost Your charm is already lost Deep down you know you have been a failure and at this point sometimes it feels like it is easy to quit cause how could you even fight u are so fragile u cannot even tell anyone How could I tell that i am not feeling good about myself If only I had some interest motivation to do work less anxious and less edgy thoughts and a little bit of luck A hopeful and non disturbing thoughts things would change slowly Nothing is going good No nothing is good i don t have friends I am isolated I am at my worst i feel so negative about myself that i feel i have no one that understands me Idk why my mind constantly tell i would have become great in another field I am not satisfied with myself I am not happy i don t think i am complete within myself there are people around me but i feel so lost alone And i think its because of my lack of motivation towards career its not that i don t like this career but i idk why i feel so anxious and idk if because of my thoughts i am feeling low or because of my career i am feeling low i just don t know Last months have been the worst I felt so anxious restless Sometimes I could even imagine myself dead constant headaches vomiting living recklessly not caring about anything i just don t see any hope at times i thought death would be kindness somedays i dont think i can even make it somedays i feel so excited Restless So Hopeful i have even slept all day cried times a day stared at fan for hours everything seems so lost and mostly i just don t know what i am talking about Sometimes it feels it is there Sometimes it feels it is not there I get upset and excited very easily too Even slight things can upset me emotionally I hate myself so much and idk how i can change at all I feel so angry frustrated I cannot get angry at others i have zero interest to fight back too I have nothing in my checklist i am truly dead already that is true i just dont want to read code and learn anything zero motivation to do anything i feel i am not ready not enough and it is true i am not enough not ready i just think i cannot be good i cannot support my family make money and all i am just done How can I change What steps should I take I have ve motivations to read to earn money to go abroad to even exist but i want to be better and i just cannot change things i want things to change but i am done with even trying focusing for even a minute drains my all energy Tbh yes things might get better or not leave that but sometimes i just can sense my death i am feeling already my death I dont even know what is good or bad for my carrer i just dont know me now I dont want to be negative but i cannot at times i dont think i can even learn something i just made a disaster of myself,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of

seen combat I m a cyberspace operator fucking stupid which is what the AF calls sysadmin for servers fucking year old laptops running winserv what a joke I digress I imagine a significant amount of people would kill to have what I have And here I am on a Saturday night drinking bourbon and wondering when the time comes to blow my brains out if I should do it outside so there s less of a mess I ve been in almost years now and I m on my second assignment A dream assignment My first base was in flyovercountry USA Good people and great place to raise kids but shitty and boring for young people But at least there I had people I could turn to people who would fight for us people who knew more than me I thought coming to Europe would be a major upgrade I couldn t have been more wrong My office is filled mostly with FNGs Our only NCO is a fuckwit I like Sgt Fuckwit as a person but he she is a terrible manager Does what he she is told even if it s unreasonable and would NEVER fight for their troops Doesn t know a MOTHER FUCKING THING about computers And this person is in charge What s that saying about never being the smartest person in the room Yeah I m the only mother fucker who can set up our equipment But most days we all just surf reddit and imgur I do about minutes of acutal work a week And by work I mean pointless military bullshit like SAPR training and how I need to not rape people Anyway I ve been in therapy for over half a year now for major depressive disorder social anxiety and being a threat to myself Also have OCD Schizoid traits I was hospitalized last year for a week because I was seriously ready to kill myself My doctors are pretty cool I have a good rapport with my shrink But since I couldn t be fixed to an acceptable level within the time allotted I am being medically discharged Short of serving and getting retired it s the best way to leave I ll get something like of my base pay for as long as I m fucked in the head Still want to kill myself I picture myself living in a shitty apartment no job bored miserable drunk etc I was also diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder I was told not to drink for months at which point I could return to responsible alcohol use afterwards I complied mostly to prove them wrong but also to see how I would feel sober As you can imagine it was terrible not being able to drink especially when everybody else is The cocksuckers lied to me though told me that I was still too much at risk after the and that mixing antidepressants and alchol is a no no Like I give a shit I tried their ways I stayed sober did the CBT kept a fucking diary and so on The best advice they offer is find a purpose and distract yourself Still fucked up Still want to die Oh and because I VOLUNTARILY seeked treatment I was referd read forced for alcohol abuse treatment Because I was was in that I am automatically getting marked down on my annual performance report In the grand scope of things it doesn t mean shit but

It s impossible for me to get along with people and I have a body that refuses to breakSo I haven t been officially diagnosed but it has been suggested by a couple psychologists that I could be high functioning autistic There was a time when I would just be walking down the street and someone would just randomly slap me or kick me in the balls or they d throw a knife or metal bar out the car window as I m walking Now it s just a matter of people want nothing to do with me and see me as nothing but a pile of shit Outside of a work place environment everyone avoid me even on foot path in the city people literally split the path to go around me At work they talk with me say they love me in what I assume is just friendly affection every now and again but come end off shit they run from me as if escaping a burning building The off chance people talk to me outside work it s someone on internet halfway across the world only to bitch about their issues and get advise and then fuck off till next time they need venting and advise I literally have no worth it seems In the last years I ve been hit by buses trucks and I stopped counting the amount of cars after most of the time the vehicles have been speeding and doing at least km h mph some of it has been my fault running across road but a lot of it has been people trying to run me over I have licence plates memorized because they have gone on the foot path to try and run me over or I have been hit by them at least times Worst part of all is my body is so resilient that I literally get up and walk away with minor scratches and bruising or nothing at all so police never believe me when I report it To top it all off my body won t let me commit suicide I can t cut or stab myself jumping off m high building ft my body instantly straightens and relaxes upon impact and rolls out against my wishes trying to drown myself by jumping into water I can t stand in my body all of a sudden knows how to swim but when I want to swim for fun I can t and drown I have been told its merely emotional disassociation and I may feel like I want to die but actually don t however that is not true at all there s nothing I want more then to die the only thing that brings a smile to my faces is the fantasies I have of all the ways I wish I could die however my body won t allow it everytime my life is in danger I lose all control and my body acts on its own as I watch and scream at my body that is absorbing impact instead of resisting or hand releases a knife against my wish as I m trying to stab it into my throat or temple,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Please I need some advice for how to not hate myself Disclaimer I don t think I m like actively suicidal I feel like I m not capable of pulling the trigger myself so to speak yay gallows humor I just haven t felt this awful in a long time and this seems like the best r to ask for help with severe depression and related mental health Also throwaway account Also obviously there s some details missing so that this isn t a novel but I tried to hit everything relevant Where to begin I think I m one of those people who was born already missing my serotonin and the current state of the USA is absolutely not helping it at all My whole life I have been extremely dysfunctional between severe ADHD goldfish brain giving me no grasp on time management or focus and my anxieties exploding my emotions all over the place and my obsessive inability to restrain precision making me suuuper slooow at everything and my autistic social ineptitude making everyone extra done with me My parents weren t the worst but they have narcissistic tendencies and drank the Boomer Kool Aid regarding child care so my difficulties were met with authoritarianism Few brief efforts were made to teach me the critical skills other kids seem to pick up on their own instead I was constantly punished for failing Middle school between my struggles getting homework done and the bullying I was at one of my lowest points ever in my life ADHD meds didn t help either I cried myself to sleep a lot when I did manage to fall asleep Things got a little better when we moved yet again and this time I found friends instead of bullies I got more lenient teachers who understood I was smart but struggling This did not last long because as time went on expectations rapidly outpaced what my raw intelligence could compensate I almost didn t graduate high school on time because of trouble completing some essays I lost my full ride college scholarship because I couldn t manage my studying at all I also was beginning to feel increasingly trapped by my overbearing parents who seemed convinced my difficulties and position as their child meant I was supposed to tell them everything and always obey them To top it off I was finally shaking off the fog of my conservative upbringing once I gained access to more internet and education Oh yeah I didn t have any real internet access until like senior year of high school During the couple short years in college and for a couple years after dropping out I tried getting various jobs to see if I could build any kind of income I worked as a lube tech at Jiffy Lube for part time got fired for struggling to clock in on the dot I worked as a lube tech at a dealership for something got stressed and anxious and dented a couple cars in the hectic environment got shunted to detail worked too slow and dented a couple more cars and got fired I worked at the local zoo in a kitchen met a machine repair guy and got a job for him for a whopping hr Eventually quit the zoo job that had me scream crying on the way home daily to commit to machine repair Few months later the small shop couldn t afford to keep me More time passes I get a job repairing upholstery also at and then stumbled into a job teaching swim lessons nearby too Eventually got fired from upholstery repair for being too slow Thought I was good on the swim job but then my idiot no filter autistic mouth said a couple things that offended a couple customers and my boss s boss fired me NONE OF THESE JOBS LASTED ME MORE THAN MONTHS OR MADE ME MORE THAN HR And I could barely handle my short hr work weeks It should also be noted that I went through a similar volume of various therapists trying to get better at adulting I got a little bit better at coping but not much else At some point I found out all those ADHD meds I had been taking my liver never actually processed the stimulants So I got on a more helpful medicine set and that helped a bit Sometime before the swim job I started going out with a guy who made me feel more motivated and adult than I ever had in my life I was yo at that point He gave me a place to live that wasn t with my smothering parents who made me feel infantile and filled the house with aggression Not being around my depressed narcissist mother especially was super good for my mental health Months go by I m mostly moved in with him After a year of this he has enough money to buy a new house and we fully move in together with trusted roomies This was really helpful for both of us as where he was living wasn t great for him either Fast forward a year later I m the most productive I have ever been in my life But it s so much less than everyone else Our roommates and my boyfriend are so frustrated by my lack of contribution With my parents all I could manage was my own laundry Now I also do the bulk of our house s grocery trips and kitchen scrubbing cooking often and I m barely making my bouncy ball brain do some studying My bf desires to see me succeed in a higher tier job and is helping me study coding and computer IT at home I m decent at doing it but terrible at focusing on it Every day I have to fight past my self hatred to get out of bed and keep fighting to stay out of bed I m worrying my antidepressant isn t working anymore like my last one suddenly did on me I m not far enough along in my studies to get a well paying job yet Disability welfare in this country is a JOKE and would prevent me from any higher aspirations My roommates say the last few times I drove them around in my currently degrading state of mind I made driving errors that make them not trust me I STILL struggle to be on time to anything so nobody trusts me on that either I can t seem to keep a normal day night sleep cycle but I also can t get ANYTHING useful done on an inverse night day sleep cycle On top of it all I can t seem to stick to any of the fun sport clubs I have been part of in the past so I can t seem to keep myself exercising which is of course one of the often suggested tips for depression It s gotten to a point where despite having improved so much at life skills here I am yo and I feel like I did in middle school again Completely hopeless hating myself on a daily basis feeling like just a burden But me hating myself stresses my bf out making him hurt which makes me feel even more worthless He s also super stressed from working a job he hates to make enough money to support us He convinced me to uninstall Netflix from my phone so I have less distractions but I had a super hard time doing it so that annoys him too The things I m already good at like making fixing stuff with my hands or helping little kids without any time management or a degree of some kind I can t get or keep any GOOD job I don t want this to keep getting worse and reach a point where I DO try something bad Right now it feels like I ll hurt people less if I somehow vanish because then eventually they d move on vs right now I actively cause problems I m gonna be talking to my amazing doc about this and finding yet another new therapist to try But I figured maybe someone here can give me some other useful advice to keep me from secretly hoping I get Covid and maybe my asthma will make me one of the unlucky ones lol,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
Help my best friend is in the hospital I just hope someone reading this is familiar with inpatient mental health services My best friend has been in the hospital for a little over a week now and she just gave me a call this morning Unfortunately I was sleeping and didn t see her phone call until later I called the hospital back and gave them her first and last name but was told they didn t have a patient by that name I m sure the number I called was correct and that the hospital was correct one it s located in the small town we live in Is there anything I can do to reach her again Should I call back and ask if they can connect me with someone who called me hours ago I really would appreciate any and all input I have been worried about my friend for days and I just want to talk to her,Progress Update,Medium

Not going to live to I ve known for many years now that I m not going to live to see Now I m and the past month has only solidified that fact It s been days since I was fired from my job and a week after that my car was broken into they stole a subwoofer and broke the ignition and insurance won t cover any of it I m waiting weeks and weeks for unemployment to be approved and that s not even a sure thing because if they determine I was fired for misconduct they will deny my claim altogether I was fired because I missed about a week and a half of work because of insomnia that came out of nowhere I was getting about hours of sleep a day after about hours trying to fall asleep After multiple trips to the doctor they put me on trazodone and it helped so I called work told them I thought I was going to be able to make it into work again and they told me they don t want me back So unless I find a job in the next month or so I m going to lose my car Can t afford to pay rent AND car payments AND insurance on the pathetic unemployment they ve determined I m eligible if I even get anything If I don t it s a matter of time before my roommates kick me out anyways I have nowhere to go if that happens I ll be on the street Between my emotionally abusive mother treating me like shit since I was a child bullying in school shitty jobs losing the only woman I ever loved to suicide and finally this combo of shit the past month I ve never really felt like I wanted to continue living In the past it s always been just hoping that a truck hits and kills me or something accidental so I didn t cause so much grief to my family for ending my own life but I just don t care anymore Tired of my family and friends basically throwing money at me to get me by even though I ve told them it makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit Tired of expecting things to get worse and being proven right time and time again despite my effort to get help Tired of psychiatrist after psychiatrist prescribing pill after pill that does nothing but give me horrible withdrawals when I m coming off I ve spent hours researching the way I want to go and I ve found it I found a way that gives me all the time i need to make my final calls to friends and family without anybody being able to physically interfere with my plans and it won t leave me in pain in the hospital it s a sure death This is not impulse or irrational or depression clouding my judgement This is deciding that my life has been shit and there s no reason to believe it will get any better and I am making the decision to end the pain I ve decided that if my unemployment claim gets denied it s time to go I m not going to go through being homeless not having the food water and shelter that I need to survive I debated posting this here at all and there s been several days before this where I decided not to but I guess I m posting here for the same reason I m starting my psychiatric counseling again next week I want my family and friends to know that I ve tried everything within my power to improve my life before I make the decision to end it Hopefully that will give them some peace of mind once I m gone So if you ve got anything I haven t already heard feel free to post it,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
Desperate desolate and depressed Xpost from r depression I m unsure if this is the right space to post it but let me just start by saying that just a few days I thought of ending my life I know what I m going to do and how I m going to do it so that it will end quickly I don t know what I m seeking for here Money Advice Words of encouragement I really don t know Perhaps anything Perhaps nothing First official depression prognosis started since high school from bullying in Internalised homosexual tendencies Pre college studies affected delayed by a year sexually assualted when doing national service where I was Kept quiet because I m a guy and it was by another man Got properly diagnosed with general and social anxiety disorder It happened too long ago but scarred me deeply I kept quiet and just kept it in Travelled alone for a bit and was okay but university came and felt like I was in the wrong place Had multiple leaves of absences because I wasn t coping Met some friends for life who kept me alive met more than didn t stay However accummulated a high amount of student loan because of this Currently on hiatus from university even when I just turned weeks ago Met the man of my life in university went through years and a lot of shit together He was my beacon and support for the longest time However this guy left me because he felt like I wasn t going anywhere which was because of inaction or lack of achievements caused by my depression and he lost feelings for me He was unable to empathize with my depression because of the way he was brought up and saw it as laziness or just plain wasting my life away He broke up with me late november in and I m still not over him This experience still has a leading impact on my mental stability I ended up doing many stupid things after some while heavily intoxicated and I can say for certain that I sabotaged any lingering bridges between the both of us He s not a bad person Family are not supportive of my sexual identity As an asian family there were high hopes and expectations on studies and success Also we were mid low class and we don t have much financial sustainability My parents they are not bad people They work hard but they are not highly educated I had to learn a lot of things on my own I have been supporting myself for the longest time even if I still stay with my parents We don t communicate much the times we do are usually very abrasive and I feel mostly isolated and alone Found my passion for the arts and drive in the media broadcast tv industry through several career opportunities in the forms of external ad hoc internships during the times when I was looking for something to do while on leave of absences However the lack of an official paper qualifications led them all going nowhere The last stint ended in end of April when Covid got serious and I was let go because I was expendable Ultimately much experience but very little income and with my age I m unable to compete for entry level jobs with fresh graduates with the right qualifications Besides I have a lot of debts and no money to start another diploma or degree elsewhere which is something at the back of my mind but never able to achieve I have maybe k usd to my name in terms of expendable cash It has been roughly months since I m unemployed and not doing anything and while I m still on hiatus from university I have to decide by the end of the year if I was to continue or terminate my matriculation I m in my final year but I m severely tormented with the idea of forcing myself through for something that I am not wishing to do in the future and that it will take a further toll on my mental health But if I leave it would be years and money wasted I have Right now I m juggling between part time work but even those are scarce and few heavily strenous and I feel like it s not enriching I ve been sending out resumes and applications but always met with rejection I tried seeking remote jobs as well like ways to sustain making money online but always hitting a wall I m basically powering through just to earn some money to sustain myself and it has been a struggle everyday I never thought I was unintelligent but I think my low level of confidence my inferiority complex abandonment issues with the breakup isolation from my family my financial burdens and the hopelessness of not being able to go anywhere in life with so much potential has caused me a lot of mental anguish I struggle with sleep everyday and I wake up everyday feeling worse wishing I did better I d like to think if I was given another opportunity or more resources in life I will have done much better and to never fall into this state Alas everything is always better in hindsight It s easy to say that you re comparing oranges to apples but when I look at my peers or close friends around me most if not all of them are in a better place than me Maybe they were born in a better environment maybe they have met supportive people in their lives maybe they all chose wiser with what they wanted to do in life and here I am feeling stuck and incredously bopeless I know there is definitely someone out there who has it worse off than me but the darkness is so overpowering that I do not know how to continue with life I wonder everyday when is the day I will finally have the courage to choose to go so that I can relieve myself from this pain I m not okay I wonder if you reading this have any resources or pearls of wisdom for me,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of

Shall I be joyous or shall I be damned Warning major long read ahead In the interest that the continuation of my life is pretty much up in the air over the next couple of weeks I ve decided to get the whole story out in the open although I doubt it will do much to help I ve never been diagnosed with anything but I m self aware enough to know when something is fundamentally wrong and depression seems like the best fit Anyway ever since I had a complete emotional meltdown during basic training for the US Army and was sent home on a general discharge I haven t been able to pull myself together with the same zeal I had when I was younger Those of you who have been through basic successfully will undoubtedly know someone like me that had everything going for them and the training isn t actually that hard but for whatever reason just snapped My family supported me well enough and the world kept on turning I brushed the incident off and started working going to college all over again Ever since my job history has been filled with initially hopeful prospects that quickly nosedive into extreme emotional outbursts that cost me my employment I spent my breaks at my first job since I returned home crying in the parking lot I was fired from the next one for punching a bathroom door in a tearful rage that struck me out of nowhere and the next few were lost due to similar over reactions that caused me to quit on the spot All of this has pretty much ruined any credibility I could have had in a job hunt as I have a grand total of ONE job that I would in theory be eligible as a rehire and I had a nervous breakdown that similarly ruined any chances I had at scholastic achievement The kicker was I could still brush this off and keep trying my grandparents owned a fairly successful business so I could live with them they raised me since my mother abandoned me and work for them and all would be fine Then out of the blue my grandmother died the day after I had a heated argument brought on by one of my emotional episodes and as she controlled most of the business details our company descended into a chaos it still hasn t wholly recovered from Sometime before this I had reconciled with my biological mother and my half sister so we came together to try and fix things and keep the company running Meanwhile my grandfather who was normally a pillar of strength and morality shook us all to the core by immediately hooking up with a year old woman down the street before we even had his wife s ashes We were so disgusted and depressed by this turn of events we decided to move to California by this point I was secretly suicidal for feeling like I contributed to my mother in practice s death so I was willing to try anything to get my life back on track but still help with the business remotely As those of you who live here will probably attest this was a bad idea We had no luck finding jobs at all not even minimum wage and next thing I know I m looking at bank statements and realize my biological mother had stolen from the business account to pay for our expenses Then she and my sister abandoned me here in a half empty house I don t have the rent money to pay for anymore successful months of credit building down the tubes it seems the business is teetering on the brink I ve alienated my grandfather by associating with them and being pretty unkind to his new slut trophy girl and here I am wondering just when the fuck everything went all looney tunes I had amazing prospects once I thought the world was mine for sure now I m in debt up to my eyeballs miles away from anyone I know about to lose my car and piss off a great landlord Part of me just wants to say fuck it all let the debt callers come and indulge the darker side of my emotional outbursts until I m put down by police or somehow become a super villain part of me wants to go crawling back and try to salvage my old life one last time to no real satisfaction and the last part says to simply take my gun wander off into the desert and put an end to this silliness once and for all TLDR No job no degree massive debt staring down the business end of a and wondering if I m pointing it in the right direction,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Getting to be too muchI gave up on the antidepressants I was taking about half a year ago because they made certain parts of my life dull and numb and at the time I was in a long distance relationship with a girl who was great at understanding my problems and making me feel like she genuinely cared about me About a month or so ago she broke up with me without warning two weeks before we had plans to meet because she had met someone else and she couldn t be with me anymore Obviously this hurt me and left me scrambling and aimless but I ve been doing my best not to let it dominate me and trying to pick myself back up I switched to new antidepressants a week ago because I ve been slipping worse and worse and thinking suicidal thoughts for hours every night at work or home This morning it got so bad I looked up information on my antidepressants in order to find out if I could overdose on them and I ve thought about it four or five times since then I think I m still okay because I haven t tried anything yet and the antidepressants haven t had enough time to do their work but it s scaring me more and more Look I know everyone s got relationship troubles and I know it hurts like hell I know my problems aren t special and I can t pretend they are But I ve struggled my whole life with relationships I m and I haven t been intimate with anyone And every time I get close to someone friend or romantic interest they push me away Every person I ve called a best friend cut contact with me Every romantic interest despite what they would say were not willing to actually be with me I don t know why It became a fear of mine being abandoned by people I cared about and my ex was wonderful to me for many reasons but she alleviated that fear She actually got through my depression and made me feel cared about and I felt really healthy and like I was making progress because of her And then to just be cut off again without warning to have her do to me exactly what I was afraid of happening despite knowing I was afraid of that it s like none of that healthiness and happiness mattered I mean I was suicidal before but now I don t know how much more I can take I still have immediate goals but it s becoming excruciating to get through day after day like this I just want to get over it to not feel like such a fucking failure with people and with myself and focus on other goals for now but I m not letting myself I just want to have someone close to me again I just want to feel like someone cares again Half the reason I m writing this is to just get it out of my system I think it worked because I m crying hahaha but thank you if you took the time to read it Some words of encouragement would mean the world to me but don t feel pressured to say anything Thank you so much,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
life just seems pointless im senior year i guess i ll start out with how i got to this point i started to feel down th grade around the time my grandpa was in the hospital which i wasn t close to he would come in and out of the hospital and i guess seeing him that way just hurt i dont even know why i felt that way when those words that he said when i was in th grade still lingered i still enjoyed doing simple things and still wanted to try out new things i bought a ukulele got in to drawing and tried making friends i actually met one of my ex best friend she will be coming up at the end it wasn t bad at all but i felt this nagging feeling above my head that i was able to ignore cut to th grade oh boy was that year fun thats when i started questioning why i was still even here breathing i started high school and most of my classes were filled with people from others schools which already had their own friends of groups compared to how i was in middle school i started to become real quiet my middle school wasn t that big and everyone pretty much knew everyone so it was easy for me to conversate with others at the end of th grade i also realized that i was starting to develop anxiety i would shake and my body temperature would go up amp was on the verge of passing out anyways as you can tell trying to talk to others was quite intimidating i started to feel alone and just isolated from everyone in my classes not only that i was in advanced classes and felt so stupid in all of them i couldn t even reach their level of intelligence i was dumb compared to all of them i no longer wanted to participate i would hate when teachers called on me it was the worst feeling ever oh i forgot to mention my grandpa died a month later after my freshman year started i pick up others emotions so i was sad would cry over everything and just felt like complete shit i had about friends at the time which i guess you could say i no longer am friends with them anyways school work started to pile up i started getting stressed about it and would even cry at times because i couldnt understand some of the stuff i started to develop some thoughts that weren t healthy in my head i would tell myself im stupid worthless all the teachers saw me as some excuse o a student and so on i started to just lock myself in my room and sleep i developed an eating disorder which i thought was normal at the time because teenagers right i wouldn t shower for days yet my anxiety kept me worried about how i looked imagine caring about what others think of you while you don t even care about yourself its a fucking pain in the ass i gained a friend that year but eventually cut ties with her during the summer th grade came along i continued to take advanced classes just to make my parents proud i wanted them to be proud of me and tell me that just one time turns out i just disappointed them more this is when i started to skip days at school telling my mom i felt sick and so once i even faked i was sick but it turned out i had strep throat kinda funny tbh ayways my grades started to go down i was usually and A or A B type of girl but my grades started going towards C s and at times D s I met this guy as well that i started to develop feelings for this was the first time i actually wanted to step out of my comfort zone and get to know them i still dont know till this day if it was a good or bad idea i honestly don t remember much about th grade year it seems a little fuzzy all i know is that my depression and anxiety got worse i was thinking about suicide more often and even thought of ways to do it just a reminder my parents and siblings had no idea that i was feeling down i would always act hyper and made jokes just to make them laugh i fake laughed and tried not to get them worried th grade i had only like adv class and an AP class to get myself to take a break i told myself at the end of th grade that i would get my shit together and even managed to get decent grades on the st weeks of school i started to have trouble sleeping my thoughts started to get more vivid and had nightmares i also almost passed out while talking in a group discussion because i was so anxious i dont know how many times i started to write suicide letters i would have breakdown every other month thst led me to just wanting to end it all this took place so last yeart then started everything started to go to shit the guy i mentioned earlier yeah i admitted my feelings towards him and he then started to talk to me less eventually we stopped talking completely mostly it being my fault i also lost my bestfriend i dont know what happened or what i did but we just stopped talking it hurt a lot it really fucking hurt i went days without eating and lost almost pounds i was pounds foot inchs so i finally became underweight that was the only thing i had under control my weight i felt at ease i liked seeing my ribs popping out i liked the way i looked for the first time even now i wish i would stop eating so much this was around the time finally talked to the counselor and my mom and sister came up and talked to them about how i was feeling when we walked out of school my sister just told me you should ve judt killed yourself in there i got a therapist around march i started taking medication went from lexapro prozac some sleeping pills and some other stuff i cant remember lexapro left me feeling numb i couldn t cry i couldn t feel a thing i remember explaining to my friend the feeling its as if you are trapped in the glass box and no matter how many times you try to break it and get out of there it didn t work you just yelled at no one when me and my bestfriend defriended i got a new friend i wasn t at the best state physically and mentally i wouldn t shower for a week i was just bone i would skip a lot of class oh yeah did i mention that i started skipping almost everyday i remember thinking whats wrong with me i wasn t like this how would i let myself get to this point i was someone that cared a out school even if it was challenging i wasn t one to get down over small or big things i wouldn t get hurt over one small comment almost at the end of march i first tried attempting with the lexapro i only took but i called my friends and they picked me up i spent time with them for a little while i stopped myself before i took more so im not sure if its really an attempt i didn t mention this to my therapist because you know i d get sent to the hospital weeks later i attempted again this time i took some pain killers it was at the time they were like mg per pill I just felt a little sick from the stomach but that was all I called my friend again and told her what was going on of them came over and talked to me my friend asked me if i wanted to tell my mom in which i did we ended up crying a lot she kept asking me why do i want to die why am i feeling like this why dont i see value in life do you know how shitty i felt i the person that lives in this body doesn t even know the cause my friends had called out but i started to act hyper i always do this to make others think i am doing well now they ordered pizza and we ate they both worked at the same place so they called the manager and told them that they could actually go in my heart broke a little that day i always wished someone would stay with me even when i told them the opposite they just left they believed i was doing well i ended up telling my therapist what i did a week later since thats when i was scheduled to go she ended up sending me to the hospital and told my mom that its best to do so or i ll end up succeeding although it was nice for me to not worry about anything anymore i didnt like it i wasn t with the people that i cared about all i needed was to be with the ones that cared and loved me even if they were acting as if they did thats all i needed i pushed them away so many times and i know its my fault i know i am the one to blame but i still felt even more depressed because i wanted them to tell me no i am not leaving i wanted them to just lay with me and hug me and just tell me everything was going to be okay even if i didnt believe that thats all i ever wanted june came along so school ended i tried again i tried overdosing on sleeping pills i took about this time even till this day i still have no clue what i meant to text one of my friends ah i forgot to mention the friend i gained after i lost my best friend dated my brother i started to like her a little after they broke up and she even admitted that she was kind of gaining interest on me while dating my brother i was so confused during this time though because she never told me straight forward if she liked me or not i wasn t in the best state of mind obviously so all that made sense to me was that she hated me she never liked me and just used me to gain information about my brother i had also stopped talking to my other friends and even stopped telling one of them the same one that works with her about what i was thinking because the first thing she would do is tell her anyways im pretty sure it caught her by surprise that i texted her that day and it not making any sense all i remember was going unconscious and then waking up several times i would try to plug in my phone to charge and i thought i would and would pass out and then wake up to do the same thing standing up was hard i almost fell because of how heavy my body felt thankfully i didn t throw up i hate throwing up cue to the next day i had my therapy appointment im surprised my therapist didn t ask if i was okay i was shaking a lot and couldn t focus i was still out of it and had the same feeling i had the day before but without feeling my body heavy passing out randomly and so i even drove that day which i know i shouldn t have but i wasn t thinking I can t even remember much of that day I do remember around pm though I started to text my friends I cant remember what i said or what they said i do remember getting angry and i started to get aggresive the last thing i told the friend that i liked at the time no wonder that my brother left you before that i do remember her saying that you can t help someone that doesn t want help thats all i can remember that just hit me for some reason all those months that i tried getting help seemed like nothing to her i was so fucking upset this was the same person that dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression someone that even attempted thats why it hurt so much i was trying so hard to get help even if it was hard for me to open up i was never taught to talk about my feelings so the fact that i told an adult meant that i seriously was in need of help i ended up blocking everyone and i cried so much i cried a lot it hurt it still hurts she even told me she thought of telling me that i should ve killed myself now i wish that she did say those words then i would have an actual reason i texted them the next day and told them i was sorry they forgave me which they shouldn t have maybe it was better and if we just left it like it was i still hate myself for saying those words till this day i haven t been the same ever since nothing feels real cut to th grade which is now i was planning on doing it on my birthday i wrote a note each day leading to it and i decided to do it days earlier i was supposed to start my first day at my job i called out and told my mom i was working i went to the park i was planning on slitting my wrist turned out the blade amp pocket knife didn t work so well on my wrist and barely did anything i didn t tell my friends about it and decided to just wait till my actual birthday thinking it was just the day you know my birthday came up and i was waiting for my friends to say happy birthday they didn t i posted on my story crying i wrote on the last note they forgot about my birthday the day i hated the most my birthday made me hate it even more i wasn t worthy of their time they saw my stort and felt bad and texted me they came to my house and gave me last minute gifts they felt forced i doubt they even wanted to be there cue to now i finally pushed them off for good i told them what i was planning and told them how i was feeling they ended up writing a letter to my mom like days ago and left it in the mail i was the one that went to get the mail that day i read it and i got really upset angry sad the people that i thought knew me the most wanted to send me to the hospital all i wanted was for them to stay with me not send me somewhere in which i feel trapped somewhere where they are not i got angry and texted them were involved in this one wasnt i texted on the gc where all were one the one that wasnt a part of it got upset over what i said the others didnt say anything until i said if that was all they got i started saying to tell me how they really feel about me because i knoe they are holding themselves back just because they are afraid i ll break i blocked all of them after that and now i have no reason for no longer to stay here even one of the people which were feeling suicidal a while back wated to send me to the hospital when i didn t even think about sending them there because i know it wasn t what they needed or wanted they needed to be with people that loved them and made sure they were safe i didnt get out of her car that day and told her i wasn t leaving she gave in and slept in my room why couldn t they do the same for me am i not worthy of having someone do that for me its kind of funny i was in my car the other day in the same spot we were in when we skipped school one day at that time i thought i was really alone but now now i ve actuall reached that i am alone now i have no one in the end i am the one that never deserved to be here i didn t deserve them i didn t deserve to live i should ve died a long time ago i dont know how long i ll be here there is no point in living anymore im just a walking robot at this point i no longer have anyone or anything to live for,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Correctable mistakes snowballed into something horrible I end up paying for mistakes I ve made or risks I ve taken in my life ten times over I might also seriously have the worst luck ever I ve looked into ending my life but it says in the sidebar we re not allowed to discuss methods so I ll leave it at that It s almost like I m just a normal person trapped in a very very abnormal life By the time I realized what was going on way too much time had passed So I ve started to formulate my exit plan I hope no one will judge me here My father is something I can t even say on here because I m too embarrassed to even say it You can use your imagination though I was severely neglected by mother she didn t even teach me how to read make a bed drive a car ride a bike my dad provided the bare basics and I learned everything else by trial and error or other people s parents As a child she would throw my shoes out the window No one but my dad knew no one would even think to ask about something so bizarre right She was really unstable and would have very public screaming fits on vacations I ve literally never seen anyone act as crazy as her not even the mentally ill homeless people you might run into like she would be on a small rowboat screaming that she wants to die on a lake for thousands of people to hear She s apparently been in this conditon since she was in elementary school but no one got her any help My mother would try to get into car accidents while I was in her car and I don t really feel safe in cars unless I m the one driving anymore She would sneak up behind me while I showered or hide in closets pretend to mishear me when I spoke and instigate hours long screaming fights like clockwork every time I went out with friends While I lived with her she would leave raw meat out on the counter over night maybe in the hopes I might get sick My mother s thought process is actually even scarier than the behavior that I ve briefly described When I have a migraine she will withhold medication for hours If I cough once she ll keep asking me if I m okay If I have a fever she d tell me I m lazy When I m healthy she screams in my face daily that I turned out poorly because she spoiled me too much even though I was so conscious of money that I wore kid s jackets in college to save money lived in a bedroom apartment with roommates have never been on vacation with her since I was even though she goes on vacation twice a year I know it sounds trivial but she literally can t go a day without putting someone down about what college they went to It s actually crazy though it s not snobbery it s like some really weird scary obsession unlike anything I ve ever seen She only sees people through this one label it s like they are not even humans at all She never listened to music read or did much of anything It s compensatory narcissism taken to the next level The only emotions I ve ever seen her express are rage and sadness and a weird flatness She sees people as superheros or peasants For a while she became obsessed with the idea that I wasn t allowed to do more than survive So I had to convince her human beings are meant to do more than survive This barely scratches the surface of my experiences I honestly should not have been born My life is such a nightmare I m not even human in the normal sense of the word My dad is also mentally ill vindictive and violent They are way more than mentally ill and abusive though They re incredibly similar to the weird neighbors in the movie American Beauty but within the disorienting gritty world of American Horror Story Honestly when that series came out I wondered if Ryan Murphy had been stalking me all these years I was a victim of severe gaslighting sexual physical emotional and verbal abuse What makes it such a trap is that they are basically outcasts so everything is totally weird the way they talk they never joke my dad knows like a total of a words they just don t have the social skills even the average person might have even our house was weird the cars they drove were weird But since they were in such reactive denial about it I could never fully come to terms with the truth So I was so brainwashed my own eyes would deceive me You might wonder how in the world I could stay in a situation like that right I think I m pretty submissive by nature and my parents hammered it into me I wasn t allowed want the stable lifestyle my friends had my life has literally been a prison where I took it for granted that I belonged in a completely different world than everyone else and that led me down a really dark path for absolutely no reason I did try to go college at first I had a dissociative disorder my whole life and my mother constantly sabotaged my college education so I could never get away successfully She manipulated me into applying to lower tier schools than I initially qualified for I still trusted her at that point I was so used to being gaslighted that I couldn t even think they were abusive until I had suffered another years with PTSD while trying to have a normal college experience having to put up with weekly screaming matches where I d be told I would never get a job and be exploited whenever I needed any money I had to move in with my mother to save money and escape but she was aware of my intentions and embarked on this terrifying extinction burst She contacted her doctor and tried to get me medicated self diagnosed me with mental illnesses and tried to get her employees to ambush me catch me off guard in the most vulnerable time of my life thousands of miles away from my support network and emotionally abuse me and completely erase my past They told me I had always been a difficult child that I had grown up a loner with no friends and that I needed anger management I was incredibly disoriented and felt like my whole life was being stolen from me I thought I was literally dead for a full year So I had a total breakdown had to try to heal in the midst of this twisted malicious intervention engineered by my mother who is actually the one who has always needed help since she was a child and I ve finally come out of that only to realize that I ve been screwed I don t know what to do My life isn t worth living I wasted so much time I planned on spending healing in order to fight this ridiculous war I totally should have seen coming but I honestly never thought she would take it this far and I m completely worn out I realize now I shouldn t have let it get to me but at the time I wasn t aware of triggers CPTSD narcissism and the way abuse works I was really naive and thought that everything was going to work out that my mother would get help and I might have the family I always wanted I don t need anyone anymore but nothing makes me happy I have no future I should have spent a lifetime focusing on myself instead of my mother She would literally try to interrupt me from studying establishing a social life improving my appearance being liked by other people and somehow find a way to make me feel crushing guilt about this on a minute by minute day by day year by year basis I think there is nothing left in me that can possibly try anymore I ve been crushed too many times and this last disaster with her has really destabilized my life I m so behind and isolated I don t think the people I used to know would even recognize what my life has become,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Being born is some sick cosmic fucking joke And its not a funny one When does life become worth living Because there is absolutely nothing here for me Nothing that makes life worth living My girlfriend raped me in November I tried to kill myself and amassed some hospital bills Then she abused me and kept me addicted to drugs for months I was in a addict IOP and it did nothing because of her She caused my suicide attempt This may sound like I m not holding myself accountable for my behavior but it is fact that she caused my suicide attempt Then I failed all of my classes I was enduring abuse I was severely depressed I hated myself and I was suicidal She isolated me from all of my friends and family My relationships with everybody else in my life haven t been the same since Then in May I had a manic episode I went fully crazy I was psychotic I was hospitalized again against my will for a week My ex girlfriend broke up with me while I was in the psychiatric hospital over the phone I was still manic when I got out So I texted her I thought we were still dating I really did I was psychotic and I thought she was still my girlfriend I texted her mother begging and pleading I was still in love with her daughter even though she raped me and abused me It destroyed me She was cruel and she insulted me and laughed at me Then they pressed charges against me Telecommunications harassment Now I m on probation for months I owe the county that I don t have I don t have a job I have to take a behavior class that costs I have to do hours of community service She s getting what she wanted she s ruining my life I am only I m a teenage girl I am in so much debt I don t have a job I can t go back to school I m becoming depressed again I live with my parents and I m convinced they think I m a freeloading loser and they want me dead I don t have any friends left I don t have a support system My only option is to kill myself There is no justice for me This will never be reconciled I have to kill myself,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
Long Story Need supportI ve been depressed suicidal for a long time but it s gotten worse over the past year It started last year I chose my best friend to be the one to take my virginity because I trusted him He felt honored that I had chosen him and it was a big deal Unfortunately I got a really bad ovarian cyst so we couldn t do it right away We promised to wait until I was completely better He broke that promise when he started dating his cheating girlfriend a few months after She has another boyfriend and she s cheating on him with my best friend and she has made excuses for not wanting to break up with her original boyfriend for my best friend The fact that he broke our promise really hurt me A few months after he started dating her I was sexually harassed on my way home from school I was on a public train during the winter and this guy started harassing me Another man defended me However the offender proceeded to threaten the guy by saying he was going to shoot him He didn t pull out a gun but the threat was there I got out of the train as soon as the doors opened After that I wanted to see my best friend for support I told him what happened and had asked him if we could meet up over the weekend the incident took place on a Monday But he decided that spending the weekend at his cheating girlfriend s place was more important than helping me I couldn t keep my feelings about everything anymore and I decided to talk to my best friend about it We got into a fight over it It turns out that he had forgotten about the promise we had made and that has permanently changed the way I saw the world People always say to think about your loved ones and how they would feel if you committed suicide but after what he did I couldn t help but think that if it was so easy to forget a promise that big how easy is it to forget someone s existence If I committed suicide no one would miss me They d simply forget about me my abusive family my friends everyone so it wouldn t matter He also tried justifying him choosing to stay at his cheating girlfriend s place over supporting me but the thing is it s not like she was in trouble or in need of support or anything He also didn t have work I needed him and in a moment of need he picked his girlfriend over me which is something he promised to never do but I guess he broke that promise out of desperation considering how many failed relationships he s had He said if I had considered if the guy who harassed me was bluffing about the gun Of course I had considered it and so did the police however threats of using a weapon are taken extremely seriously Plus I didn t know if he was bluffing or not He could have been but he could also have been serious I told him that work is understandable for not being able to see me during that time but going to his girlfriend s house instead of helping me during an important time is not and that he can go to her house at any time He said Still it s what I chose to do cause I wanted to We fought some more I did hurl a few insults here and there and he said he s not going to talk to me for insulting him for spending time with his girlfriend We eventually apologized and made up The thing is the damage has been done and I m still hurt by everything I haven t completely forgiven him either I can t look at the world the same This combined with living in an abusive household and being made of my family and family friends about me eating I m skinny has taken a toll I think about suicide almost all the time and I have no one to talk to I ve tried antidepressants but the ones I ve tried so far haven t worked for me so I m still looking for the right one I see a psychiatrist and a counselor at school but it s summer break and I can t see anyone now especially because I live with a narcissistic mom I ve attempted suicide a few times during the summer including on my birthday I can t stop thinking about suicide I don t know what to do I ve contacted hotlines a few times but I don t want to be a nuisance and they re not always helpful Nothing seems to be working anymore I want to die I wish I was never born I hate the world I don t want to be here anymore,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Cold empty alone I m currently sitting in my room after a particularly horrible moment with my mother and don t know what else to do You probably already know what I want to do I don t even know why I m here Just turning to the one place I know Reddit Sorry for any mistakes my eyes are leaking I know no one cares about any type of backstory or even me but I guess I should give a bit more background to make myself seem a little less like the shitty teenager you ll think I am But first of all what sparked this particular fight if I can even call it that was I was just having a generally shitty day Felt nauseous all day for some reason my mother drove over a curb which caused the pizza we had just bought to spill onto my brand new white shirt plus my mom has just been rude all day to me to strangers It s just your typical annoying day I was annoyed and you could tell Wasn t really speaking much but when I did I was short with her and bitter This annoyed her and I knew that but I couldn t make myself cheery Right before our fight I was telling her about Juice WRLD and how sad it was I had already mentioned his passing earlier but I m a big fan of someone he had collaborated with didn t know they had collaborated until that moment and was explaining to her how they apparently collaborated During saying this she was nodding her head and acting like she was listening but apparently she wasn t She started coughing a few moments after I was finished speaking and said I was choking the entire time you were talking Thanks for noticing and caring Really means a lot Now if I had noticed she was choking I would ve immediately helped her I m not that horrible When speaking to her I was looking directly at her and she was nodding the entire time and didn t seem in distress whatsoever I was confused and told her this but she said she was making it obvious but couldn t tell me she was choking since she couldn t breathe and was coughing I pointed out she didn t cough until after I finished speaking but she just said I was wrong I let it go because I don t want to argue so I just go back to browsing Reddit She asked me now what did you say and I just told her to forget about it it didn t matter This is where everything went horribly She persisted come on tell me Now I ll admit I yelled at her Everything was boiling right under the surface and I just couldn t keep calm anymore She proceeds to tell me she heard me mention Juice WRLD and my favorite band but she didn t know why I told her then she must ve heard me This is when she decides to push my buttons She starts saying how I m just the happiest little girl she s ever met I m almost how I m a ray of sunshine and SUCH a good daughter and she s laughing this entire time I m ignoring her because she does this all the time looking for a reaction and I don t want to give her the satisfaction This is when she mentions how I need happy pills and she doesn t know what type of pills that would be but I need some kind of pill she didn t mean antidepressants This seemed incredibly insensitive to me as I was just speaking to her about Juice WRLD and of course so many people are thinking his death is caused from drug use She knew what she was doing I ll admit I said something really disgusting I said good maybe they ll kill me so I can finally die She s known about my suicidal thoughts since August of this year and didn t much care when she found out She actually found out because I had told my sister about some notes journal type things I had written to help me cope She confronted me like I was in trouble saying we need to talk and you know exactly what you ve done She didn t do anything except threaten me with making me go to a hospital and sent me to my room I ve brought it up one other time on Thanksgiving after a huge family fight saying May I had a handful of pills ready to go and didn t do it She made this about herself saying how she must be a terrible mother I just ignore it at this point After I said maybe the nonexistent happy pills she s speaking about would kill me she started going off She said I have no business acting like my life is so horrible how I have the easiest life in the world how other people my age have school jobs and even kids and how she doesn t make me do anything and hands me everything on a silver platter I ll get to why this really hurt me later But she just kept saying that I shouldn t act like she s the worst person in the world because she s the best mom I ve got she says this every single time me or my sibling is upset with her and I stayed silent the entire time I was crying but silent She knows why I struggle with living but doesn t care She dropped me off at our shared home and left She has actually came back home as I was writing this I m currently locked in a bathroom A big reason as to why I struggle with living is because of chronic illness For probably years I ve been sick I genuinely don t remember what it feels like to not feel pain It started with a rare condition which was causing me to vomit every day of my year old life and I started to lose my vision Took a year before they figured out what it was but i was on medication for a long time spinal taps every couple months before I finally had brain surgery in A few months after the surgery I had a fever every single day of August It took a while before they discovered what it was IBD Not many people without IBD know how much it sucks and I m sure my experience is unlike other people suffering with IBD but when I say my IBD has ruined my life I mean it I haven t been in remission once since fall I ve been close but there has always been something wrong My GI office that I stuck with from beginning to summer of this year also didn t help much as I found out I had been on medication I shouldn t have been steroids for years which has also made my life a living hell I have since been diagnosed with cushing s syndrome because of the steroid use I also have fibromyalgia osteopenia and gastroparesis Things were bad May since I had that handful of pills but that summer I was started on chemotherapy and it genuinely ruined my life I don t know if my reaction was normal but after a couple doses my days started blending together It s hard to describe but it felt like my average day was maybe an hour or two long During this time I felt absolutely zero emotion I felt nothing I just remember wishing I could feel again Crying and being upset hurts but being physically unable to feel nothing being completely and utterly numb is so much worse I really could not feel And I thought it would get better after I was off of it but I didn t for a long time I was so numb and so scared I m still not back to what I was before The only way I can describe how I feel is like I m in this super deep dark hole I m completely alone it s freezing cold and all my senses have been ripped from me All I feel is so scared I m always scared I have nightmares every single night about my worst fears and I have flashbacks about different procedures Sometimes I ll be sitting doing nothing and feel like a feeding tube is being forced down my nose I know it s not really happening but I get so scared A lot of traumatic things have happened to me and my doctors and mom make me feel like I m being a baby about it I ve never sought help for any of these mental issues because I know I won t be happy or okay til I m normal Not sick Not in pain For my mom to tell me I have the easiest life in the world really hurts I am in misery I keep trying to claw myself out of where I m at and recently I ve been happy Or I thought I was But last night I felt a little strange and then today this all happens and I realize I was never happy i was just trying to pretend I was I m exhausted I m tired I m having a hard time breathing and I just want it all to be over I don t want to be alive but I can t make myself kill myself I m a coward I pray every night that I won t wake up the next day so when I roll over and see the sun through my blinds see the posters on my walls and feel that I m still here I m upset The one thing I want won t happen unless I do it myself And I can t bring myself to do it no matter how hard I try What makes it so much worse is my grandmother dad s side called me while I was writing this She brought up how our entire family has been depressed and how she felt like she was in a fog She told me this while I m ranting about wanting to die How cruel is that Even worse my grandfather wanted to talk to me He is the only father figure I ve ever known the only man I ve ever trusted and loved and my light and purpose He is the only person to ever fully love me His love is unfaltering and he s always been here for me I had to give short responses because I was sobbing but I m really good at hiding it now so I don t think he noticed And then he told me he loves me so much and to please take care of myself He told me he loved me again I broke I think he might ve heard me but I don t know I needed that so badly but the worst part is it isn t changing my mind I still want to die How can I be so cruel and selfish That s disgusting of me I don t even know if I want to send this now But I just don t know what to do Want to die but can t do it Coward Don t really want help but here I am anyway I just want someone to acknowledge me and understand I want someone out there to understand why I want this and understand me I want someone to know I exist as well I don t have any friends and few family that speaks to me My mom is the only person that really talks to me I dropped out of high school a while ago because of teachers claiming I was faking my illnesses and I can t get a job because my immune system is so weak I ve had a cold for a month now And I am a complete loser I might sleep now Actually sleep not die Still too much of a coward to do that I doubt anyone will read this but it feels good to be able to put it all out there My head is busting and my eyes are so swollen I don t even much care really No where near as painful as my current thoughts I m sorry if you actually read this TL DR your basic

Do therapist ever help I am contemplating seeing a therapist but I don t actually know what I will get out of it I think I am kind of depressed right now but for the most part me wanting to kill myself was not because of depression It s a logical decision based on my own reasoning I think a lot of people see a therapist for medication if I don t want medication is it mostly a waste of time I guess I want someone to listen and maybe surprise me with an insight angle I have not thought of I am also afraid I ll be sent to a hospital if I am being too honest I m getting better but I m really just taking it one day at a time The future scares me and I don t have motivation to do anything other than sitting at home after work To me it s actually more comforting to think about dying than to live,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
I just can t do it anymoreI m just not going to post my whole story here because it s way too long and no one is going to read this anyway The long and short of it is basically I ve been through some traumatic life experiences and that leaves me with a laundry list of mental illness I started self harming myself in middle school and it went unnoticed until I had to get tested for scoliosis and the school nurse saw my arms She told the guidance counselor who called my parents and all that basically came of that is my mom said why would you do this I just stood in my room wanting to die so badly because I didn t cut in noticeable places and still got caught This didn t make me stop until about th grade of high school I don t know something changed in me I grew out of the self harming phase and I was so proud of myself I had a boyfriend who I loved at the time life was good I was self harm clean for years I was unhappy with myself again and then my boyfriend committed suicide Everything went downhill from there I couldn t cope I took a leave off of work and went to a program every day for mental health I started self harming again and I was diagnosed with trauma ptsd depression gad and I m pretty sure that was it I was started on medications and was having a lot of hallucinations This went on for awhile and then stopped since I was talking a lot in group at this program and getting a lot of validation on things I shared I was in the program for months and then I completed the program and I had showed enough improvement I still stood out of work for a little while longer and continued to work on myself I met a guy he is amazing and always listened to me and still does I can honestly say I have completely finished grieving the loss of my ex I am in a happy healthy relationship and thats all I could ask for A month a go I lost my sister to triple negative breast cancer she fought to the very end I feel traumatized because I basically watched her die I am left feeling empty in a sense All of my mental illness are hitting me hard Self harm is always on my mind I really don t see a point of me going on anymore I will never be good enough for myself and all I want to do is hurt myself I just don t know where to turn anymore I don t want to hurt my loved ones but at the same time I m hurting so badly that its taking away any quality of life,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
I keep trying and nothing changes Warning Long Post I m going to describe my situation I m and will be this March I did a year of college and withdrew because I realized if I went to a city or state funded school it would be far cheaper and just as good an education than the college I was at But at the same time I realized I wanted to move out of New York Either way over in interest accruing debt from that measly two semesters of college I urgently needed a job of course to pay rent in the mean time I lived in Brooklyn for a year in two awful living situations with crazy roommates I couldn t move back home because my brother has severe violent anger issues and has used racial slurs including the n word in the past and my mother is a horrible alcoholic That was years ago in Since then I have gone through more applications trial runs and interviews than I can count With no degree and no specific skill or experience I have applied to mostly stores and some restaurants in that time I ended up moving back home with my mother and now she pays rent for my brother s apartment in a town over Not because of me because she kicked him out The longest job I had was as a cashier at a Stop amp Shop for months I worked full time hours most weeks more than hours a week but they thinly skirted the system so as not to give me healthcare I ended up quitting because they gave me hell about using the bathroom Seriously the people who were supposed to cover me would refuse to let me use the bathroom and would call me on the loudspeaker when I had only been in there a couple minutes It got so bad that I could never relax enough to pee Damnably I still have the problem to this day I ve tried everything I quit the job in April almost a year ago and well before that the urination problem started Frequent urination I m positive it s from the job I have never struggled with this before in my life It doesn t feel right anymore if I am exercising I have to go at least every minutes so I don t exercise anymore The doctor told me it s psychological and told me to see a therapist More on that later I was denied unemployed benefits blamed by them Can t get food stamps because I don t meet eligibility since I don t pay or more of of my expenses Yes my mom and her father pay rent but she does not give me any money She used to and then stopped entirely I can only survive with the food pantry in my town Since then I ve applied to so many jobs I ve lost the people I used to talk to because they started blaming me saying I wasn t doing enough and it was my fault too No friends I m a virgin which I don t care about I don t compare myself to people and I hate the predominant culture that assigns value to such things anyway always have I m so poor that dating and relationships are impossibly distant anyway I don t talk to my mother anymore at all She is an alcoholic that neglected and abused me and my brother our entire lives and feels zero remorse and blames and vilifies me for every little thing every chance she gets Her father physically assaulted my brother and flat out told me the one time I tried to reach out to him that he doesn t want to see me or ever deal with my problems Needless to say he drinks and verbally abusive to his wife too He took my mother s side when I left home at one point because of how bad my mother was house hopping with friends I no longer have before I went to college My mother is a compulsive hoarder and the entire apartment is a mess so I ve never had guests over and it s hard to cook food I m vegetarian so all I eat is oats cereal spaghetti and occasionally frozen vegetables But even that is hard because the kitchen is such a mess and if I tried to clean it she would scream at me for throwing something away or make it messy again and blame the mess on me My father is out of the picture the last time he emailed me he blamed me for leaving college and doing nothing He has a new wife and daughter and lives in Japan Needless to say I don t think he deserves to know how hard I ve been trying against the grain of everything I don t drink smoke or do any drugs of any kind Never have never will Never had the slightest interest in it This makes me even more isolated almost everybody at least in New York City does I d rather be alone than be friends with any of them no question The only way I could theoretically have a life again is if I find a job save up earn money to move out I knew it would be hard but I don t mind working at least hours a week standing all day focusing on the job waking up early and coming home every day when it s dark I m used to it I have a great work ethic and am polite to everyone Just recently I lost two jobs at a pharmacy and waffle shop in my town Why They just Didn t Like me They refused to give me an explanation I kept myself busy the entire time took notes was diligent and polite to everyone And nothing Just now my mother threatened to evict me Unlike my brother who was drinking and fighting with her I keep to myself She threatened to kick me out because the neighbors in the apartment make up lies about noise I know the noise is not coming from me because I am always quiet but she believes them Wants me gone Has talked about air bnb ing my room She never loved or wanted me and only sees me as a problem and a burden and would prefer me dead More money and space for her I try not to think about how horrible she is because the opposite of love isn t hate it s indifference I need to just focus on my own life finding a job to be my own independent person and focus on things that matter to me As I told her before she is not my mother So I feel nothing but once in a while in push come to shove situations like this I have a nervous breakdown So one time the police came because a neighbor called them because I couldn t stop screaming and crying But that had nothing to do with the noise complaints this was recently and after them I m positive I don t want kids I got a vasectomy from Planned Parenthood They gave me weird energy and so did the doctor I saw later about the urination Your average person thinks you ll regret it or you just got it because of the way YOUR parents were In reality I am not bringing a son or daughter into this world that has to deal with the problems of this world They would have to deal with all of the political social and climate resource related problems in the world They wold have to deal with heartbreak loss work suffering have the possibility of an accident or unbelievable agony from illness know they will die And at the end of course die I can t look into the eyes of my beloved child knowing they will die I don t not believe in God or the afterlife I KNOW that God or the afterlife doesn t exist Biologically people are dead and dead for good There are enough people that know they are alive and know they will die Theoretically I could be just as happy without kids and a family I have no idea how with all of this but I volunteer every Friday in Brooklyn taking a commute that is over hours both ways It s not really surprising it s my only connection to the outside world because I have no friends here in the suburb I grew up in and am stuck living in now I m not close friends with any of the people there though and it s led to nothing I never tell them about all of this and occasionally if someone asks how I am and I say anything less than great they would think I don t appreciate what I have since I don t pay rent Some of them like me but it s nothing if I can t get a job to move on with my life which I can t Every day is unbearable Theoretically I am a like able person but none of it in practice matters After all is said and done the final question is why do I not see a therapist Why not talk about this to them instead of this website One word medication I had a bad experience with one that I had since middle school who got so fascist about it he would refuse to talk to me unless I took it Which I did one mg pill of Prozac In case you didn t know that s the smallest possible dose of a mild antidepressant that takes weeks to kick in or taper down from You can laugh at this I took one pill and my balls started to hurt My body literally rebelled against it That was how much I was badgered into doing something I didn t want to do He wasn t a psychiatrist but he was connected to the one I saw who prescribed the Prozac So I quit both of them This was soon after I left college in I know most psychologists therapists would be the same way Blame me Something is wrong with me I don t know a lot but I know they are wrong I know how intelligent polite self motivated I am Every problem I have ever had has been reacting to external circumstance and with that a lot of patience and fortitude If I had money everything could be different I would have time space a place of my own and would live alone I would still work but using my gifts for the world Or even a drudgery job I wouldn t care But as it is my life has been my mother and brother their constant threats and abuse stuck in it with every effort to proceed with my life rebuffed and actively painful thrown back in my face When I lived in an apartment I could only afford one with roommates who were also psychotic My own ticket to salvation a job I have been trying to find one and failing for years with countless problems and crazy people at them I have been so patient with but even there I leak out the side sometimes They would say I have anxiety emotional problems ADHD trouble focusing and need medication And that if I don t take it I m immature blaming other people instead of taking responsibility I could not possibly be more mature or responsible If I wasn t these things this entire post would be hate for my parents for not giving me money But what is it It s focusing on the fact that I can t get jobs or even at least unemployment benefits so I can eat and survive while I look for one But I accept that because I can t change it and even then focus on getting jobs And I know that medication is not the answer At the end of the day I am finding myself lacking the willpower I still try to apply to jobs but every day strangles me more than the last The very motivation is stifled because everything of my body and mind has learned that all of my efforts boomerang back in my face It s so hard to try when the job people yell at me and blame me and think false things of me no different than my mother It s terrible that it has come to this but more and more lately I think how suicide would be a sweet escape No more pain or suffering This can t be denied The only reason not to do it is that there s a possibility of things getting better and being happy in the future I know I can never be happy living with my mom that s for sure So I ve held on all this time on the possibility that I might get a job and move out I see a lot of posts here saying things like Everyone says it will get better and It won t get better Slowly I am waking up to the fact that these things are no less true for me Of course part me wants to live But as I realize further and further the impossibility of getting that chance at least not having to suffer anymore slowly becomes more and more enticing The one post I won t tolerate is saying go to college in New York now I hate New York and everything about it and am positive I want to move Do not say there is no heaven or wherever you go there you are or anything of the sort I am not in the slightest idealistic and I know everywhere has problems no less than I know that the only possibility of me being happy is moving If it took more than years to save up enough to move while living here I would accept that if I knew that once I moved out I would never have to live with my mom again but at the same time I would rather die than live here for another years in this condition while also being busy in college and having zero to show for it except less money and more debt This goes for years community college also Or living in the city which I also hate and I know there are no perfect cities no less than I know there are cities substantially different than New York City And I am never living in a dorm situation again From experience at two different colleges I know it s a nightmare with zero independence or privacy I want to get a job save up move to a city and go to a city funded college in the city whilst having a job to support myself I m positive I want to go to The West Coast or Europe I am realizing that it may be impossible and so the only other possibility is death You could say I could move to a place with a job with the degree but then I should be able to move with a job without that This world is evil There is a caste system that kills young people that have no skills by only letting them have kitchen or customer service jobs kicking them out of that blaming them denying their survival unemployment food stamps housing while they look for a job and the only way out is to take out a loan and being in debt for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars This is the most evil plutocratic thing ever The world is truly by and for the rich My friend who I no longer really talk to since he blames me for not having a job has EU citizenship through his mother and lives in France as a full citizen He is the luckiest person I know My mother was born in the USA but my father in Iran I sometimes think of getting Iranian citizenship since I wouldn t have to pay for college small potatoes compared to the work of learning Farsi Recently a thought has come to mind that describes my life I am asking for nothing and I can t even have that If I was asking for a house a car a job that paid enough to support a wife pets and two kids it would be different but I m not asking for any of that I just want to live alone have at least some time to pursue things like art that matter to me even if that always has to be on a shoestring budget and any mediocre job that is at least manageable if not difficult This has not been difficult it has been an impossible ideal No wonder I am depressed An unemployed no degree half Iranian year old NEET teetotalism virgin living in the USA the most murderous war machine in the world run by Donald Trump with a psychotic Nazi for a brother an absent father who thinks I m a loser and an alcoholic verbally abusive insane mother with zero friends an empty wallet and bank account rejected from every job every type of job every place over years because I am told I am incompetent anxious loser when in reality I am as hard working as they come I ll always know that the problem wasn t my negative thinking Everyone says change to more positive thoughts first if you want your life to change Nothing could inaccurately reflect my situation more than this I have had so much hope in all of my efforts for something to change or happen through those very efforts itself mind you not just waiting for things to change I ve gotten it out and even for this board it s a very long post No offence to anyone here but I see a lot of posts with a lot of missing capitalization punctuation grammar and spelling mistakes My grammar is anything but perfect or ideal but relatively speaking my writing is pretty polished if not only superficially as opposed to structurally I don t take pride in this but I hope if nothing else the effort to clearly articulate everything thus far shows If you ve gotten this far you must have a thing for reading the thoughts of depressed strangers on the internet Even if not one person reads it I at least typed all of it up And even if someone does at most they can just reply just cold words on the computer screen that might as well be my own In spite of everything I just said you can say whatever you want I would rather have people s sincere thoughts and feelings not be stifled from coming out After all nothing in the planet makes me angrier than the fact that the job people can t even tell me why they fire me A gun is put to my head and my last wish is to know why I have to die and they laugh as they pull the trigger It is one trillion times more damning and insulting that they hold back on account of my feelings or because they can t be bothered to tell me why they do not hire me than the fact that they reject me to begin with I ve never had a problem of cyber bullying because it s just words on the screen Say every awful thing if it s what you really honestly feel about me I ll appreciate the honesty even I assume people are reasonably nice here but the logic still applies At the end of the day I want what everyone wants to be happy But I ve given up on that I have tried for years which is one fifth of my lifespan If I cannot be happy at least I can not be unhappy For now I will keep trying on an empty tank of gas every day more emotionally stifling and painful than the last But like everything there is a limited capacity to this And unless suddenly my luck changes the capacity will eventually be reached And I do not believe in luck I only use it metaphorically as metaphorical as it would be to mention my situation improving Until then no thoughts well wishes feelings or prayers can help me Only tangible improvement which I know damn well can only be brought about by my own efforts which the blamers that is to say everyone I make the mistake of mentioning all of this to love to tell me more than anything I am making those efforts You know the results Medical problems more rejection violence more pain The tangible improvement will either come first or death by my own hands which I have had unfathomable patience already in holding off from But sooner or later the logic of it will become clear I don t want to die anymore than my biology wants to survive What will happen will happen but either way I dread the pain of the future,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
I ve set a date to dieI guess a little background first might be useful I m I ve suffered from depression pretty much constantly since I was and I probably was depressed long before actually being diagnosed In the last few years I ve started different courses at university all of which I ve ended up having to drop out of because I couldn t handle the workload and my depression would get really bad this leaves me feeling really worthless particularly when I see all my peers beginning to start careers I ve never had a girlfriend probably largely due to my lack of confidence not that I would end my life over something so petty but it contributes to my feeling of worthlessness The girl I ve liked for the past few years already has a boyfriend which would be easier to deal with if he wasn t a complete jerk and practically the opposite of me eg overflowing with confidence doesn t really give a shit about anyone but himself A few months ago I decided to tell her how I felt despite this not intending to interfere with her relationship mainly just thinking it might help me move on which it didn t unfortunately I did this through facebook as I couldn t get a chance to speak to her alone and even though she didn t seem to think less of me for it I ve regretted doing that ever since On top of that I really don t have any friends and never really have only people who are friends in certain situations never really inviting me anywhere or socializing outside of those situations whereas I have tried to do that so I m constantly feeling alone and feeling like I don t belong anywhere So I ve planned a date to kill myself Like most people I don t actually want to die but I can t keep going like I have been and I ve run out of options in fact part of the reason I decided to set a date was to hopefully change my mind and make myself less likely to do something impulsively and I even decided on several things that if they happened I wouldn t kill myself but I realize now those things aren t likely to happen between now and then I was trying to decide between dates one of which was today but ended up deciding on the later date because it gives me the chance to do things I want to do first I don t really know what I expect to get out of this I ve already tried so much and seen several counsellors psychologists and psychiatrists and I ve improved a bit but I don t know how to keep going any more anyway I figure it can t hurt to post here,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

How I feel The story I m not like most people I m special Special doesn t mean better It doesn t mean worse Only different At first sight I look normal I act normal But I did figure out that I wasn t and it only took me two decades So my situation s a little different than others here I didn t live through a traumatic event when I was a kid according to me My parents didn t beat me Didn t get bullied too much I m not in pain I don t feel alone even though I am I didn t have a best friend when I was a kid It wasn t a health problem so I didn t talk about it to my physician And when I felt anxious well everyone else did too Nothing strange there either a kid was stressed or didn t give a shit I talked about my feelings just as much as the next guy which is not at all I could be wrong there since I didn t have a best friend It all seemed pretty normal to me It was pretty normal to be stressed and to not give a shit And I could do both Fast forward a little and it becomes obvious that I m not normal In my early twenties my friends were my co workers I had started smoking to cope with the stress Random people had earned my respect for coping with stress without that crutch Going out once a month is definitely not normal Not having friends is not normal Not seeing your parents for months in a row is not normal It made me different Not better not worse I had already thought about killing myself briefly During I kid you not an insurance meeting with the HR department She did the math in front of me not exactly challenging I had to work another something years to get full retirement benefits At the time I thought I could do it I was let go about years later I didn t think about my mental health issues for some time Eventually I did my own research to find out relevant details I m reasonably certain that I also have alexithymia lack of emotional self awareness and anhedonia inability to feel pleasure It s always easier to spot a problem in retrospect but it explains a lot Why I don t miss people when they re gone Why I don t cry at funerals Why I rarely get angry Why I never knew what to ask for on my birthdays I don t form emotional bond with people There s no one in my life to whom I can say with certainty I love you A blank space is a list of every thing I want My whole life has been driven by what I don t want I don t want to stand out I don t want to be unemployed I don t want to be homeless I don t want to live I don t want to walk around aimlessly choc full of antidepressant Don t want to work years in a daze Don t want to get stuck in a psych ward Don t want to get worse Things aren t bad for me They re not good either I can t remember the best day of my life Can t remember the worst either But I do remember some bad ones I don t want to kill myself but I think I ll do it anyway,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
You don t have to read this it s too long I could care less and or more but I have little actual life in meThis is just another one of those days Another meaningless effort to socialise and be part of the collective without drawing attention Of course my mind wasn t going to let this down Multiple professionals have diagnosed depression and Asperger s but only fairly recently I feel like shit on a solid majority of the day and always turn to memes and videos to distract myself I have a pretty dark humour and enjoy abusing it to shock those around me which inevitably pushes them away Obviously I take my choices in practicing that abuse Main focus is a nihilistic approach at things with an affinity for factuality Our existence is meaningless null and void until we ourselves make the difference But I never could bring myself to do it The closer I get to real life and all it entails the more I try to reject it both sub and conciously I am repulsed by the idea of having to struggle even a bit so that I could continue living at a satisfying point I have little idea what real ward work is and never planned on finding out years of age seem long enough since I kept hating myself for about a third of them and thought I wouldn t last before high school graduation I have gone to several doctors all while aiming to fight back against my instinct to deny their help Taken pills drugs of different kinds anti ts could only do so much Because of the afforementioned and in addition to an enjoyable imagination I find human life to be uninteresting and lacking of a specific charm so I would always wonder why we aren t endowed with more fascinating abilities that have been concieved recorded and shared through hundreds of thousands of beloved stories I keep fantasizing about the big what kind of answer I would give to an offer of wishes and go over it again and again trying to perfect the phrasing the expression the absolute perfect way to request my most deepest desires to the dumbass higher power that has the ability to grant them while incapable of understanding them completely Ultimately I feel like scum for living in my own head more than on the outside although I refuse to do anything to change it I deserve not what was given to me from birth and if only I didn t care about the people i ve interacted with just enough so I despise the idea of potentially hurt anyone at the news of my death I would have already left,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

R suicidology banned Suicidal ideations can often be coping mechanisms one might not be intent to committing suicide but just the thought of knowing that the option is there mitigates the suffering of life The reality is that people kill themselves everyday and have been doing so for hundreds of thousands of years you can t stop it happening because it s a rational response to the bleak nature of life I despise reddit for banning suicidology it was somewhere I could discuss my feelings and thoughts without stigma or people saying don t do it life gets better type of rubbish Free speech is a delusion reddit has banned dozens of suicide sympathetic subreddits Fuck reddit,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

F A logical reason to kill myself I have been considering attempting suicide again and I decided to take a more logical approach Please bear with me Today I am years months and days old Of those years I only remember about years months which completely normal The average person lives days I have lived days so admittedly I have barely started As I reflect on my years of conscious memories I see that I have been unhappy for most of a majority of it On average I believe I have been okay in other words ranging from happy to merely alright months of each year Of course those months were are scattered among the not okay ranging from depressed and suicidal to just unhappy months To paint a better picture here are some rough numbers of the my years in which I can definitively account for Feel free to skip over this Okay Years Months Weeks Days Hours Not okay Years Months Weeks Days Hours If any of math is wrong please keep in mind I was very upset while doing this Basically my point is life does not seem worth it It has been hell and I see no indication of change I am days from th birthday and I will make it Next Wednesday I am going to kill myself I will be found on a Thursday and be diagnosed dead on the same day I came into this world I ve have endured years abused watched people I live die and lost all my friends I think I am deserve some peace I don t remember doing anything so bad to deserve this but hopefully my life is enough I ve decided I will do it unless i have one more good day before Wednesday I ve only good day this year and it is the only way I can endured more days Not just a day where I don t cry or feel devastated I am talking a really day A day where I truly smile and laugh A day where someone hugs me I don t remember the last time I was hugged or even touched by another person Well that wasn t a hit I m talking a touch of comfort or friendship A day where I am not alone and I can actually have a reason to talk A day where I am heard If I get one more of joy I will endure,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
am I the cause of my own demise Never posted on here before and I m not sure why I feel the urge to now I used to cut myself all the time in my head I did it for attention I wanted people to notice and ask me if I was okay so I could say that I wasn t and they safely tuck me away in a hospital for crazies and the doctors would spend months trying unsuccessfully to break through my emptiness The reality was that I was so scared of people seeing my cuts that I hid them the best I could despite having hundreds at any one time my family had no idea until I flipped out at school I was sitting in some stupid class I think we had a relief teacher it was a class where you could sit and talk with your friends and do nothing and the teacher wandered around doing sweet fuck all I don t know why but I grabbed a Stanley knife and sliced into my arm multiple times I remember it stinging so bad because there were so many lighter cuts underneath them I laughed I felt like I had something to prove A boy saw the blood and told the teacher she came over and I said he was lying but she wouldn t leave me alone so I pulled up my jumper sleeve and screamed at her to fuck off as I ran out I don t remember what happened next but my parents were told about it and I d left the school grounds The school councillor found me and for some reason I agreed to go with him to hospital He took me to be evaluated by a child shrink I barely said a word and I didn t look at him once I felt like I was in a trance the air around me felt so cold and heavy It was decided that I was perfectly sane and didn t need any sort of help what so ever The councillor took me home and my parents asked to see my cuts before never mentioning it ever again So anyway I continued to lead a destructive lifestyle most weekends were spent wiping myself out with a bottle of straight bourbon or vodka I hung out at local music gigs with my friends many of them much much older than myself I did things to the extreme because it made me popular not always in a good way I went out of my way to stand up for my behaviour so if someone in our extended friends circle thought I was a dick I d push and push until their close friends liked me and they d eventually give in and treat me nicely too Meanwhile I was a straight A student my parents worked a lot they didn t pay much attention to my schooling my grades weren t bad so they didn t give it a second thought In fact they saw me as being responsible I often babysat my little sisters one of them from when she was only a few months old I wouldn t abandon them or throw parties or anything but I did play horrible mind games with them and they d never tell because I d scared them into believing that was worse than whatever I d tricked them into thinking had happened was happening All of this stuff it was selfish I wanted to be the rebellious renegade cool kid but my parents and to a point my teachers were fed this bullshit goody two shoes image that they fell for This is how I got away with never doing my hometown handing in essays late wearing incorrect uniform everyday never doing exams never paying attention spending most of my time in the classroom yelling and laughing and making excuses Looking back I can honestly say that I am amazed at how much shit I got away with and that I finished school I found comfort in typing to a select few male friends for hours upon hours I often developed crushes on them but they never went much further than sex i was young and they were often in their early s One guy in particular sticks in my head not sexually or anything we never even went there back then in fact he broke his hand after punching a tree at his birthday party because he felt so bad that I was so attached to him at the time So that was my first real broken heart our friendship was awkward for a while and then I moved away and we have barely spoke since As a teenager I threw massive tantrums but I didnt realise the extent of them until the last few years when I discovered that I have black outs where I am in an uncontrollable rage I remember my parents holding me down at to check for track marks on my arms I must have been pretty psychotic for them to accuse me of being a junkie Teen angst I assumed but years on my episodes have only gotten worse This is already a stupidly long story I don t even tell this to my shrink so I ll summarise the rest quickly my family moved several hours away when I was in my second last year of school I hated my new school I felt so stupid and lost and uncomfortable I got pregnant had a secret abortion and never forgave myself I moved back and lived in a granny flat with one of my sisters Finished school but things just went ever the same I d discovered drugs Pills and speed My school friends didn t understand I moved back to the city near my parents The guy I got pregnant to had hung around and I was living with him until I realised I had only stayed with him because I was a mess after the baby thing he got abusive when I left him not wanting my parents to judge me or seem weak I kept living with my ex filing in my weekends with raves and a rebound guy One thing that did impact my life at this point was ghb considered a dirty scum drug I had a big crazy image to build to ensure I was popular in this new scene it was easy I had nothing to live for I hated myself for what I d done and the more I partied the less I had to stop and deal with the consequences I ended up in an ambulance times in weeks I passed out and woke up in some random guys bed with him fucking me I ran away and went back to the club I met a guy that loved going out too but knew I needed help so he wouldn t let me out of the house no matter how much I kicked and screamed We went out for a year but we were bad for each other we substituted ghb with speed and were still taking ghb when we could I spent destructive months after he left me in pieces My friends saw the tantrums one night male friends tried to stop me from hurting myself but I am stupidly strong in these rages and I managed to smash my head into the concrete several times until they let me go and then I ran and ran and don t remember the rest Ghb was ruining me again I met a guy from the rave scene I didn t think I was ready to leave my ex in the past but I decided to give it a chance So glad I did best thing that ever happened to me We moved in together after only a few weeks and years on were engaged I don t want to disclose the finger details in this time but I will say that whilst I m a better person we still give in to temptations just as often and I still have anger issues but until recently I hadn t wanted to hurt myself like I do right now My sister died a short time ago Overdose But on opiates It s not real to me it confuses me I can t make sense of it I don t want to deal with it I was diagnosed with ADHD anxiety disorders including mild OCD about a year ago Since my sister died my OCD is my way of coping things that used to be funny but necessary to me now physically hurt if I don t do them or if I do them wrong I can t help but think that my childhood desire to have people feel sorry for me paved the way to becoming that person Sometimes I wonder if it s just all in my head if I don t completely believe that I m sick how will I ever help myself When I get angry I often black out my partner tells me what happened each time I ve tried to jump out of his car at high speeds on a freeway drank bleach tried to grab a gun off a police officer hit my head so many times it s not funny taken pills blah blah right now it all seems like a good idea I feel so selfish It makes me feel worse,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

In the middle of another low I don t see why suicide would be a bad thing in my case In a shitty college with shitty people and I don t have the motivation to make myself feel better by joining clubs and finding new people I am on antidepressants and I am seeing a counselor I d like to have a discussion about why killing myself would be so bad starting with family I haven t been close to my sister for over years She ll post on my facebook wall intermittently but that s about it The last time I saw my biological mother was when I was in st grade I m now She ll be okay I have two stepbrothers but we aren t very close either My stepmom is great but we aren t close My Dad has always been there and singlehandedly raised my sister in a foreign country the US with little money while studying full time for a JD He loves me but I couldn t care less how sad I d make him feel However family isn t the biggest issue I only keep some contact with my best friends from high school The friends that I have in my current school have either also moved on I m going to be a super senior or have weird quirks that keep me from being able to develop any deep friendships with them I am fully aware of what I have accomplished and I have accomplished some good things but that is irrelevant given that I m feeling shitty about my social life I guess right now I m more confused about why I feel so rejected and lonely I just get the sense that the world would lose nothing if I ordered from cyanide pills and died tomorrow I d definitely make some people sad but they ll move on and that ll be that What would be so bad Really I am listening,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
I want to kill myself next month on my birthday Turning I have some sort of mental illness I don t know what I have a few theories but I d hate to self diagnose It use to be manageable I had a very loving girlfriend who use to help me and make me feel better I was always open about myself to her but I wasn t very open about my darkside until towards the end of our relationship She realized how bad it was Likewise she also suffered from mental illness and along with that she survived through various forms of abuse throughout her life She broke up with me because I made an egregious mistake which though wasn t built on bad intentions was horrid in its affect I hurt her and I can only hope that she gets better I love her so so much We re trying to be friends but it s obvious that it hurts her healing process to talk to me She was the only person who I felt ever actually cared for me She was the one person who I ever felt emotionally secure with She was the one person who I felt actively cared for me and my well being in that she would worry about me and check up on me Now I don t have her and now I have nothing Its my fault I just want to hug her I hate the way time works When something happens it happens and theres no way you can change it My relationship with my parents is strange My dad is an alcoholic and probably bipolar Sometimes he and I get along but when I m being myself he often calls me weird strange retarded pretentious etc He does it jokingly often times ganging up with my sister on me but it still hurts I go along with it and laugh it off but it hurts He s suicidal The only time I ve seen him in two months was for Thanksgiving I m worried he is going to kill myself out of loneliness as he has no one as well and that it would be my fault for not having seen him recently My mom is very nice and cool but for some reason I just hate it when she talks to me I know one reason is because when I do rarely get emotional she talks to other people about it or makes a bigger deal out of it than the situation warrants or tries to pity me which I also hate I don t like it when she knows things about me because she tries to solve it and because again she tells people about it or will use the information to embarrass me at family events which are already tough for me My sister hates me I think Really I think I m a burden on everyone s life in my family but I m trying to avoid platitudes I think she hates me because she always gets pissed when I talk She ll whisper with my mom when I m out of the room about how inconsiderate and lazy I am Recently I came out of my room to the living room to try to socialize with my mom and sister and when I was responding admittedly annoyed by whatever the fuck she was just huffing and puffing and gritting her teeth at my mom as I talked to her and finally my sister said What the fuck is your problem dude To which my mom said Hey no cussing And then my sister said Just talking to my name Implying that any conversation with me will devolve into her cussing at me My mom laughed School is awful I use to have good grades I was in the gifted classes up till middle school Starting getting sad all the time and lonely and my grades began to slip Went to an awful middle school my th grade year and dropped out to go to school online within a quarter of the year The next year I had to transfer over from the high school that would have taken in the middle school I went to and instead to a different school Because of my transfer student status I have to have above a C in everything and less than absences All of this was doable but my depression got worse this year as the year progressed and my grades got worse and worse and my attendance got worse Now I have three D s Two of which can be feasibly increased to a C The point being that I will most likely have to return to my jurisdiction Go to a school where I won t belong and know no one I ll miss her at school I ll get even more depressed I know I ll start to skip I ll have even less emotional support than I do now So I have no one No emotional support No sympathy from others No friends Nothing I ll probably have to move schools which is one of three connections I have to her the other being our jobs we work at the same place and social media texting I lost the one person I ve ever truly cared about and that has ever cared about me and its because of me and I hurt her I m losing passion for the one thing I think I m good at My birthday is in a month and I will have no one to make me happy All this is temporary but it shows a pattern I am mentally ill in some way I will always struggle and I am too cowardly to continue trudging if I am alone Sometimes I fantasize about running away somewhere warm and just dying alone Taking refuge in my own soul Completely unbothered by other people Not expecting the love of others Just knowingly dying by myself I ordered four books on amazon James Joyce by Richard Ellman fairy tales by ee cummings Catcher in the Rye by J D Salinger and Lust for Life by Irving Stone and I m hoping they will all come in before my birthday so I can read them beforehand If not then I will read what I can But I really don t want to keep doing this I don t like it I m not happy I don t think I ever will be nor do I think I deserve it I m just done,"Cause of Distress,

depressed anxious and overwhelmedHi so this is going to be extremely rambly because I m so anxious depressed I can barely string thoughts together Right now I am in an outpatient program I was inpatient before that and I m terrified I have horrible suicidal thoughts every time I go home but when I m at the program I m fine My new medication is upsetting my stomach even more than how my stomach usually is and I was told to tolerate it for a couple more weeks and see if it will stop They want me to go home for good in a couple weeks and that s even after I bargained for more time My mom is spending tons of money for me to stay in a motel and drive a couple hours back and forth on the off days from home to the program I m beyond anxious and I feel like there s no solution to my problems and I feel like such a burden to my mom and it s driving me crazy I feel like I have no future I m and I don t have a job I m not in school I don t know what I want to go to school for maybe I want to be a therapist maybe that s what I think I SHOULD do because I think my life has no worth if I don t help people I dunno I don t know if I could even handle school I suffer from severe undiagnosed fatigue issues and also some GI issues from taking antibiotics for a year and I could only manage to take one class a semester when I was going I think I should probably go to school away from my family to get out of my shitty area and house and to become more independent and reduce distraction but I have this fear that by leaving my parents I m going to regret leaving and losing that time with them when they die which is very overwhelming aaaaaand lastly I have only one friend who I met through the program but they live hours and hours away from me so I m struggling to accept that too because I already feel attached and I m trying to find reasons to stay in the area afterwards like going to school in the area just so I can be close friends with them and hang out all the time I m really trying not to kill myself right now but I m just drowning in pain and anxiety and fatigue and I can barely get out of bed No one can seem to help me and I just want to die to make it all stop,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
Will soon be on my own with very little emotional stability Hi all I am years old No degree no job live with parents minimal independence I am pathetic I let things get this bad and I constantly go back in my head trying to figure out how I got here I was diagnosed bipolar and have been trying to work through my problems for a long time through various forms of therapy and medication However I didn t do everything that I could possibly do and now things have just gone on for far too long My parents are at the end of their rope and I ve completely ruined all of my social relationships My parents are in a very bad place financially and I ve been looking for work I ve been telling them that I want to find a place of my own to ease their burden but they say they worry about me I know it will be hard because I ve never had to do anything for myself and completely fail at being a person but it s the only solution I see to make sure that I don t burden anyone with my mental issues I don t have much money to my name and my parents are offering to pay rent but I feel like that could lead to more issues The greatest solution that I can come up with is killing myself since that would solve absolutely every single problem My parents would be hurting for a while but they have another son that is much more together than I am so they will be able to completely focus on him I won t have to suffer anymore this way and I won t be able to become a burden for anyone else I want to believe there is a way for me to be happy without making life hard for other people but the idea of suicide is so enticing,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Long story please read and comment I have been feeling extremely suicidal as of late to a degree where I now dream of all the possible ways to end it I typically dream of my old apartment building and jumping off of the pool deck on the top floor I have lost a lot of things in my life and I have struggled with a lot and I just don t have the strength anymore Back story follows I was born into a loving family a terrific father a loving mother and my older siblings and twin brother Well my father found out that my mother was an alcoholic who would drink incessantly and it didn t get this way until my older brother s drug problem started getting worse Well after my father begged my mother to stop time and time again he decided he had enough and when I was my dad left my mum turning her occasional drinking into incessant drinking My twin and I had to live with my alcoholic mother and did all of our lives and the drinking never stopped years after my father leaves my older brother dies of a drug overdose and this makes the already bad drinking into a horrible habit starting as early as or in the morning and being smashed by I didn t know that my mum was the way she was until about th grade I entered middle school a fat loser because I had no friends from trying to care for my mum who always told me she was sick Well I entered and was made fun of all the time for my ears which were a bit large for my head at the time I have since grown into them I was bullied at school and came home to be bullied by my mother and if I was lucky I would have dinner typically I only had breakfast because we had no money for lunch and I could have some bread for breakfast As the years passed the drinking became worse and in th and th grade I attempted suicide a few times not really sure how to actually end it Each attempt failed obviously and each time it angered my mum but we never got me help from the quack I was never diagnosed with depression which I knew I was depressed and we never did anything about my urge to kill myself In my sophomore year I met a girl I thought I loved The relationship was great at first sex all the time and worries later I had never been in a real relationship so I thought this was how it worked We had sex all day every day She was a year older than me so when she left for college things became a bit rocky and I wasn t stable enough to deal with it at the time Shit went downhill and we broke up a few times and eventually went on a break around Halloween time in It was on this break that I met the girl of my dreams It was at my friends birthday party whose birthday rests on Halloween We met up and I was absolutely blown away by how unbelievably beautiful she was We began talking and we had interests in the same bands the same way of thinking the same type of humor We had a blast that night and we flirted cuddled and ALMOST kissed but I realized that would probably be in poor taste Y see my ex the one who said we should take a break never actually broke up with me she only said we should be distant for a bit not that we are broken up so I felt really guilty about everything I had done with this amazing girl who we will call Jill I couldn t confess to Jill what I was thinking I was too scared and pathetic to do so so I broke ties with her Well I found out my ex was fucking a lot of other guys AFTER telling her about Jill and her being pissed at me for even having had feelings for other girls Eventually the bitch ex and I break up and within two weeks Jill and I start dating Jill blew my mind every single day with how fantastic she was she was funny witty extremely smart and exceptionally beautiful I woke up every day and realized I have something worth living for now We were happy all the time and within a month I told her I love her and she said she loves me too that I am the most amazing person she has ever met in her life I was head over heels for her every day was fantastic because she existed in my life and every day was great despite all my other problems because in my life problems don t escape me Well about a month ago she dumped me because she didn t want to be tied down for the time and the shitty thing was I was going to propose in a few short months to be exact I know it is corny but I was going to surprise her at her college and find her in class or wherever and just kneel down and straight up propose to the girl of my dreams my soulmate if you will Well after she left I realized how bad my problems really are and how much worse things are getting now that I have put them on the backburner My debt for school is mounting ever higher and I don t know how to take care of it My college fund has been drained almost entirely and I failed two of my courses this past quarter because Jill dumped me and because I was terribly sick for a month Well I have to wait another months to take them again and I don t know what to do My mother is kicking me out because of my bitter mood even though I don t say a thing to her she also let me know that I am a loser who has done nothing with his life and fucked up the only job I had My Dad is breaking his back to help pay for school and because of my commute and the hours the schools have I can t get a job no one in my area will take on someone who can t even guarantee weekends I am not into drinking or doing drugs because of everything that has happened in my life and because my family obviously has a problem with addictions aunt is a drug addict grandma was too another aunt was also a drug addict My problem is this I have spent so much of my life in denial that now all the deck is stacked against me I have go to a school that I hate doing a major I despise and the college won t let me transfer about of my credits and I have no money to start fresh somewhere else My mother has slipped back into her old demonishing state where she lets me know everyday what I am doing wrong and won t let me stand up for myself My ex Jill is extremely happy now that we are broken up guys are constantly flirting with her on her page on facebook and constantly trying to hang out with her and none of my friends even give enough of a damn to call or ask me to hang out I have been strong my whole life dealing with my mother and having to take care of her and sacrificing my own personal life to make sure she doesn t fall down the stairs in a drunken stupor and get herself killed I was strong when my twin got into a car accident that almost killed him and I was strong when my twin decided to start drinking like my mum does My mum is clean now but she still abuses the fuck out of me and I can t be strong anymore Jill tells me she loves me that she wants to get back together someday because she sees me as her soulmate but I don t think I can just get better and not be sad about what she did to me I don t know what to do anymore I don t even remember what else I should put on here because there were so many problems in my life Please I need some advice I dream about killing myself every single night and all day every day I can t help but imagine how much better life would be without me being alive I daydream about my Jill being happy with everyone else and not caring about me anymore I don t get any support from my friends my dad tells me that I can t dwell on things and my brother would never understand The only person who does understand is my female friend who lives in Canada I am literally on the edge right now and I am so close to just ending it all and calling it quits Please I need some advice TL DR My life sucks my mother was an abusive alcoholic who wouldn t feed me for days at a time my father was never there because my mother wouldn t let him my brother took up drinking one of my older brothers died of a drug overdose I have no aspirations and no plan for a future and the only future I saw myself having walked out on me because she didn t want to be tied down right now I am on the

Life is pain m My life story is long upsetting and frankly a little unbelievable at points so I ll spare all those details despite the fact that they give context to my suffering The point is is that recently I ve moved states because I wanted to leave a very stressful job I had elsewhere I now live with my father who is mostly insensitive and mechanical in regards to my existence The extent of his relationship with me seems to be him asking why I don t make much money and constantly telling me to get another job and suggesting random jobs for me to do He also says I should just get up and go even though I have no emotional motivation Unfortunately I now have a tedious and mundane job working at a call center and it feels as if my mind has been put through an incredibly dull blender The majority of my co workers are in their sixties or more and what few people I can relate to don t care enough about me to remember I exist outside of the office so I don t have a strong friend group or support system What s more is that I was recently diagnosed with genital HSV I ve had two sex partners my entire life and I know I got it from my first one because we had unprotected sex once and the infection is localized to a point that is usually covered by a condom She decided to ignore me a long time ago so I can t tell her about it Anyway with a lack of money a car friends and now the end of my hope for a sex life I no longer want to live I ve felt that way for some time now but the feeling is especially strong now I have been diagnosed with clinical depression in the past No offense but I don t need to be told that things will get better and that I just need to hold on Are there any suggestions as to what I can do I m not stoic enough to put myself through rigorous daily exercise The pain of it outweighs any other feeling I get I do take a lot of long walks,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Dear my friends who read this and everyone else Hi I m James You have never met me or will likely never do so I am a depressed year old boy who is trapped in life and a viscous circle It started at the ripe old age of Entering Year th grade I always knew adjusting into a secondary school wouldn t be the easiest but hell I tried getting on with everyone It seem some people just don t get along I was average weight for a guy my size and was always healthy Now however is no longer the case You see bullying destroyed me Not in the sense of mentally where i just lost it one day and lashed out No it literally picked my life apart and my future bit by bit The person i was back in Year th grade no longer exists I was happy looking ahead to what could be an amazing life with a nice enough personality likeability and body to go with it But that changed I got along well with the group of friends I joined in the second year of my secondary school Though we were classified as I suppose the nerdy ones Up to this point everything was fine That is when I was destroyed forever past present and future I started to get bullied then again so do a lot of kids but it affected me more than others For months I would take the bullying and abuse shrugging it off but I was comfortable I started eating more and more to feel safe it was my little thing i always held close food It was like an anti bullying anti depressant for me it was weird but nevertheless what comes with eating more food is weight I started gaining weight out of control I went from this little lbs kid to over lbs in a matter of a couple months I could no longer run hell even jog By mid end of Year I was heavily obese with asthma problems But i wouldn t run or exercise in general because i was still made fun out of You know fat fuck running to loose some weight yeah I was but I said i was just going somewhere and would just stop running Moving on i was bullied through my schooling more and more Still gaining more and more weight by the start of Year it was Suddenly noticed by a relatively new teacher a teacher who came to be a saving grace Though too little to late a saving grace nevertheless This teacher we ll call him John saw me gaining weight eating way more than i should getting told off for eating in class or slagging off daydreaming probably about killing myself or how much better my life would be somewhere else Now in the UK year is the final year for schooling so it was highly important to revise for exams and get through the school day This I could not do hell I couldn t even get to school without being out of breath or faking an illness to get a day away John finally gave in and gave me the rest of the year off to revise for exams and get prepared for the end of the year I never did prepare i slept my days away glad that i would never have to go back apart from exams where i was separated from the people who destroyed my life I did my exams and failed most of them Completing my schooling This was the best thing that had ever happened to me leaving this place Though it still lived on in my head and heart killing me every time i thought about it Even to this day if i have to walk past or drive past the school i end up in tears over the time i spent there The only person i have to thank in my life the only person who cared Who gave a damn The only person who loved me like a brother Who saw the pain the suffering The times i said i wanted to kill myself Wo then went and told John the person who saved me more than anyone else could My friend Niall He is part of my little family My true saving grace Months of grief even after leaving the school i kept saying i was ok even though dying inside I luckily got accepted into a college that i did fine at I stopped eating as much though Still way more than i should I was left alone there i didn t know anyone made no friends and was alone THIS is where everything stopped being about the bullying and the shit i was given at my last school But inside i knew they caused me to be overweight and not great to look at So now i was lonely and sunk into deep depression a depression i never uttered a word about for years I dropped out of my college for personal issues and had months off Still obtaining a good grade from that college i moved into another one immediately as the next school year turned over Thinking i was over from all this shit thought everything was ok after my months off It was not i entered the new college where there were girls everywhere with boyfriends being happy my mind slipped back into a state of horrific depression worse than anything else I started eating more and more again on top of that i was still lonely with know one i know attending this college either After weeks at the college i cracked to my parents i cried for hours that day pouring years of abuse and depression all at once but never once uttering i was lonely because the way to deal with it is loose weight and become healthy young guy again become who i wanted to be since i was that little th grader But i knew that i was never going to be that person so i decided what i was going to do But that would have to wait First i went to my doctor who put me on the SSRI Citalopram i was taking mg for weeks to no effect I was then moved up to mg and i was sent to emergency youth counselling I was there for weeks once a week Telling this woman everything about me and what went on not once crying or hurting It was just nice to feel free telling someone that was going to tell know one else about the real side of my depression After the first week i told my closest friend Niall about the real side of me everything I continued on with counselling as did my depression The Citalopram didn t work After weeks i told my councillor that i was fine and that she helped a lot But she knew that i wasn t fine I started to self harm and drink making myself more depressed and wallowing in self pity I went out a lot of times one month with friend told not to drink But i still did I self harmed more and more Then the best thing that ever happened in my life came up It was a weekend in mid April A weekend i was looking forward to no special event i just was Niall invited me to an anime convention Now i wasn t even an anime fan I d only ever watched Gurren Lagann but i went along and for that one weekend i was free I was happy i had camera round my neck and by GOD did i abuse it I used it as an excuse to talk to people Girls mostly I got more love and affection in that one weekend than i did in my entire life I was truly not alone or unhappy I had people notice the cuts all down my arm being only a day or old they were raised and red Rather easy to see Though know one questioned them and for that i was happy That one weekend was the best days of my life Thank you for that Niall After that i was next sent to the doctor weeks after initial counselling ended The doctor saw my wounds and suggested i go to a psychiatrist So naturally i did still on the citalopram so at this point i was still depressed The psychiatrist put me on a new drug called Mirtazapine i was in mg of the stuff for weeks and it did a hell of a lot more than the citalopram ever did I was feeling better I wasn t depressed but i was still a bit lonely Now i not usually the one to beg people or bother them but the only other assistance i had stopping me killing myself was music this artist in particular being Veela one night i sent her this email http i imgur com PPbHq png I didn t expect a reply from her being as popular as she is I mean she made some pretty popular music http www youtube com watch v HzBL nK Zo among the gaming community To my surprise she did Not by a simple little email either she went out of her way to record me a video http www youtube com watch v sdTfm LzHXk amp feature youtu be which was attached to a tiny email simply saying lt http i imgur com Eizlr png Now i was super excited that i got some love from some relatively unknown Canadian girl I was extremely happy I am much happier now and I m grateful for my friends that i have and for Veela keeping my little boat afloat some

I can t tell anyone the real reason I m suicidal I was recently put in a psych ward for the suicidal because I was stupidly dropping major hints that I planned to kill my self in hopes that I could ask for help without destroying my pride When I was put in there my family blamed it on Prozac seeing as one of its side effects is suicidal thoughts I ve talked to therapist after therapist and I told them all the same thing But I haven t told anyone why I really wanted to kill myself Not even my closest friends The real reason I wanted to die was because of a girl I know it sounds stupid but hear me out I had known this girl for years and have had a HUGE crush on her from the second I was introduced to her Many years went by she had moved back and forth a few times When she came back this time I confessed my feelings for her She said the feelings were mutual but she wasn t ready for a relationship yet seeing as she had just gotten out of a bad relationship I made sure to let her know that I understood and planned to respect that About a month goes by and she is very flirty with me Touching me writing me little notes making fun of eachother sending me hearts etc However just when I think I m getting somewhere she gets back together with her ex They were all over eachother Their social media s filled with posts about eachother and going on and on about eachother The works Now not only was I fucked sideways in this situation but she still keeps me just close enough so that these feelings can t go away And she still does all the flirty things she did when she was single She is the only girl I ve ever had feelings this strong for I can t help but love her But after a month and a half of this It didn t sting as bad it just made me very depressed and sick I was starting to get over my suicidal feelings The psych ward really helped me realize a lot However all of those feelings rushed back after we hung out We grabbed a pizza watched a movie made eachother laugh and went for a walk in the autumn leaves She looked absolutely amazing She made me happy The entire time I was with her I didn t have a single worry Nothing else mattered It felt like I was in heaven It was then I realized how much I actually love her She told me she loved me but it felt so hollow as if it barely meant anything to her I just felt so empty knowing how disposable I am We talk often and she says she considers me her best friend I obviously play along but she means far more to me than any friend ever has We talk almost every day we hangout at least once a week and she still acts as flirty as she used to but I know it ll never go anywhere It s sad to say but I put all my eggs in one basket and somebody stole it I know I sound really pathetic but that s why I lied to everyone I m ashamed that she is the reason I wanted to end my life Don t get it wrong I have a life outside of her I have friends and family and hobbies and things to be proud of but it feels like none of that matters without her I m truly a piece of shit but I guess that s why I m saying this to strangers on the internet,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

After trying so hard she s ready to give up everythingEdit I m sorry this ended up being a wall of text out of my own anger I m really not sure where to start with this I m going to explain what I know as well as what I think is occurring My cousin has had a rough year She can t find a job due to job market being crappy she doesn t know what she wants to do for a career she is out of school because of financial trouble and she was diagnosed with a type of cancer that may prevent her from having kids She isn t married but I know she has always wanted to be a good wife and mother someday All of those problems are awful but there is something else that upsets her more Last night I was forced to go to a family event and I spoke with her to kill time I learned that she was still with a guy that she had problems with late last year I don t know what kind of problems I only know that they both messed up and were trying to be adults about it and repair their relationship I thought that was really nice that instead of breaking up they were being reasonable and realistic in order to stay together But I think something else must have happened recently something bad During the time that the two have dated I noticed all of her accounts on different websites disappearing completely Her Facebook disappeared first That one was always pretty inactive so I didn t say anything about it when I first noticed it was gone But she used to post drawings weekly on a few sites and kept a blog for writing and one for photography She also used to frequent Reddit All of those accounts are gone now I thought why she would trash her art and stories like that I felt like I was going to explode if I didn t ask her about it so I hinted at it in conversation She told me My boyfriend thought I relied on the sites for attention I want him to see that I don t She said that with a happy face I couldn t believe that was the reason She drew things she liked for herself she didn t draw things other people liked to gain attention I asked her about the other sites and got similar answers I don t know what has happened between the two I don t know if my cousin ever was an attention whore If she was she certainly isn t now She is nonexistent cautious humiliated and very down on herself I stopped asking her about it and we sat down When she was reaching for a napkin she accidentally tipped over a glass that has a small amount of water inside She stood up to clean it and apologized dozens of times I heard her mumble to herself You idiot You retard She has never had good self esteem but this is a new low I later asked her if her boyfriend has ever called her names She said yes but it was because she always did something to deserve it I can t imagine what All I know is that I would never call someone I loved a retard And if that word ever came out I would apologize immediately I don t know how this man talks to his family and friends but I don t think it s the same way that he talks to my cousin I noticed she has harmed herself physically She has also lost weight Whatever he has said to her it s been bad enough to make her physically ill and stressed enough to harm herself to escape it I used to harm myself and I know how much mental pain you have to be in to do it I can t believe someone put her through that and wasn t worried enough to change how they communicate I had to go to go back to the house the gathering was at to pick up my coat Since her home is in the area I stopped by to ask her if I could see some of her art I figured that might cheer her up I just realized that I forgot to mention her and her boyfriend are in a long distance relationship That is relevant because while at the gathering last night she was asking about jobs from relatives that live in the same state as the guy She had no luck When I got to her house she had about fifty tabs pulled up online for jobs in his area I noticed her room was very bare She used to have posters on the walls stuffed animals on her bed you know it looked like a room someone lived in and liked Now almost every single thing she owns is in boxes and a lot of her personal items seemed to be gone She told me not to worry that it had been packed up for weeks That makes me think that she s been just as stressed for weeks and that s worse As I have said I have no idea what they re relationship is like entirely I know they ve had really bad fights and it s put her in a very dark state of mind But I also know he s flown her out to his parents home and taken care of her during her stay with no problems at all I feel like she will do something drastic if she doesn t get to move If she moves or doesn t she has a lot of healing to do Her self esteem is very damaged I asked her why she was so stressed about finding work she responded He doesn t think I have tried He doesn t think I care for him I do everything wrong I have to do something right I disagree with that If I didn t I wouldn t be posting here I know her boyfriend shows he cares by taking her out to eat and buying her gifts She isn t doing well financially and neither are her parents so she shows her feelings by making amazing art pieces and sewing stuffed animals and key chain characters based off of good memories about their relationship I know he s thrown the gifts in the trash with her in the room I m guessing he s also made her feel bad about the times he s spent money He calls her names and has convinced her she s retarded I can t tell if he has a bad way of showing he cares or if he is the one that has mental problems The breaking point for her seems to be when he says that she doesn t care If she didn t care why would she spend hours on art and sewing Why would all her possessions be in boxes Why would she be applying to every job she can find from a fast food cashier to a janitor I am so confused that she does all of those things and that he flies her out to see him and then says that she doesn t care about him The last thing she said to me was What if he doesn t love me after all of this I won t know what to live for Their relationship none of my business I am just very angry that my smart and talented cousin has been cut down by a man that she wants to be with I think we have all had our feelings hurt by someone we care about But I have never been in a serious relationship so I don t know what to say to her There are two sides to every story but I really don t care what his is I don t think whatever he says could make it okay that my cousin has hurt herself and given up almost all of her hobbies that make her who she is I certainly don t think his story would make me feel that my cousin should die I don t know how to help her She probably doesn t want to talk about the bad parts of the relationship there isn t much I can do to help her find work and worst of all I wouldn t know where to start when helping her build self confidence back up I might ask her to post here if she feels like talking Please don t assume that my cousin has mental issues because of this She is a very caring person probably too caring sometimes I just don t want her to end her life or think that there is no good reason for her to live just because someone she loves thinks it s normal to verbally abuse her like that,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

I m a failure and a disappointment When there s nothing left but guilt why continue I ve always said that I would kill myself if life got too hard I don t believe in god or an afterlife so it always seemed like the right thing to do My life philosophy has been to enjoy myself and if that s no longer possible what s the point I am everything I don t want to be I m a year old college dropout virgin living in my mom s basement working for my dad buried in debt and getting high everyday I got myself into credit card debt in my time in college and because I m capable of making long term plans but incapable of following them in the short term it s not gotten any better I ve spent the last two years with the active goal of getting out of credit card debt and I m exactly where I was when I started I d be worse off if I hadn t already hit my credit limit I m sure But this isn t about money This is about guilt I have let down everyone I know and love on so many occasions that they have lost faith in me And rightly so I m flakey If I promise to do something I might do it If only my conscience would let me live like that I feel terrible every time I go back on my word every time I so much as suspect that I ve let someone down The only thing that has kept me going till now was the constant deep feeling of guilt Is that any way to live I have no self motivation I can t do anything unless someone s breathing down my neck about it Left to my own devices I get high play video games masturbate and sleep Wake up rinse repeat I let my lizard starve and dehydrate to the point that when I finally tried to give him water he was so weak he drowned in it I got a puppy with my previous roommate and we neglected him until he took off one day and got hit by a car And that was the better fate for him Two weeks ago I skipped an entire week of work I haven t gone to work since Thanksgiving now I m an embarrassment to my dad he wants me to do well he tries to push me but I don t respond I haven t said a word to him since Sunday not even to tell him I won t be coming in Because then I d feel worse and I m a coward I have a sense of responsibility but no willpower so my commitments end in disappointment for all and guilt for myself Somewhere along the line I failed to learn basic human social skills I can t carry a conversation I get scared and can t describe my ideas to anyone I m reading a book you ask me about it I give you a dismissive answer and go back to reading not because I m an asshole but because you scare the shit out of me I m terrified of touching people anything from an attention getting poke to a hug Hell I can t even say people s names because it feels wrong Because of all this it takes a huge amount of effort for me to even be in social situations let alone try to talk to people I end up isolated by choice and hating myself for it So that s what it comes down to I m a selfish loathsome person and I hate myself for it I feel nothing but guilt and self loathing except when I m escaping through drugs and entertainment The only thing stopping me from killing myself now is figuring out the best method and who to leave notes for EDIT I drove around today looking for a good place to jump from but couldn t find one I spent the rest of the day in a weed fueled haze at a friend s house almost entirely quiet drifting in and out of consciousness Then as I was coming home I pulled into a cemetery and spent the next hour holding a knife to my throat and listing the reasons I had to die But obviously I couldn t do it I called my therapist to schedule an appointment as soon as possible Clearly my antidepressant is no longer cutting it I m going to talk to my mom about my attempt tomorrow morning and my dad at work I hope for the best with that Thanks everyone who posted This morning I was sure this was my last day I m not sure how long I ll keep at it but you ve given me the strength to try for a while longer,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

What does seeing a doctor about depression actually do for you I m not really at the suicidal level yet and if I ever were I have a plan in place that would take years to finish anyhow I m not sure if this is the right place for this then but I ve been wondering about what seeing a doctor for depression and getting a diagnosis will actually do for you I ve never talked to my doctor about mental issues but from my experiences and looking at the symptoms I m fairly certain I would be classified as having some form of chronic depression dysthymia and or cyclothymia possibly venturing into a major depression at times It s been this way for years and at times I wonder about asking a doctor about it but I always think back and figure Well what good is that going to do If I was offered a card referral to some counselor I don t think I d be very interested in going I don t have the time nor the money to dedicate to something like that and even if I did I think I would be so against the idea of talking it out to someone about problems that it wouldn t be very effective I know it s a mental issue so it s not like there is some magic pill or surgery that takes care of it I just feel like I d start a process of being thrown to an endless cycle of therapy and counseling So what purpose would there be to seeing a doctor or would there not be any,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

and wanting to dieFor as long as I can remember I ve been angsty but when I was perpetually suicidal for about a year up until a few months ago I thought I had clinical depression I was also having some hallucinations from the stress I got put on some medications and eventually felt better Now I m feeling that way again and I m wondering if maybe this is just how I naturally feel I recently found out I have Asperger s and I know a lot of aspies have constant battles with depression I ve sort of being trying to deny it to myself but every day it is clear that I can t stand life I recently got a job and I think that has made it all worse I was previously a highschool dropout and I spent most of my time in bed and visiting depression support forums People say that once you start doing things you ll feel better but for me doing things just creates things that overwhelm me I have to go to school one day a week for this job I ve got and I m looking through this logbook thing I have to fill out and I know that I just don t give a fuck about it I have no aspirations to succeed I just want to be happy but happiness is nebulously defined for me and I think that s because it isn t possible My mother doesn t know I m suicidal again although I have spoken of how I d like to quit this job and the school My father recently died and she doesn t want me to quit the job because she says we need income She says she doesn t think we could get benefits for me even though I m diagnosed with autism That may just be her trying to coax me into staying though Either way I can t help but feeling my family would simply be better off without me in the long run I am ultimately just a drain on precious resources and I don t care to be here I think the only thing that has stopped me from killing myself is the fear that it wouldn t work Maybe it will get better but I really can t see how and if I was dead it wouldn t matter if it could have gotten better I wouldn t have any conception of it If I had a pill that was certain to kill me right now I know I would just take it I think if I try to kill myself it will probably just be cutting my wrists because knives are easily accessible I know that usually doesn t work but I d go the whole hog and make sure it was deep and long and down the underside of my forearm I m really scared to do that though because if it doesn t work my arm and hand will be thoroughly fucked up I just don t see any reason for me to stick around I wouldn t say I really enjoy anything and life is just a big ball of stress for me I found out recently that a friend I used to have on one of the depression support forums tried to kill herself and it s making me feel like if she can do it then I can do it Hopefully I would succeed and if not at least I wouldn t be expected to work or succeed anymore,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Just skip this Only posting because I spent like an hour writing it It s long but not crazy Just ranting Incapable of death My mum took everything away from me I understand why If I was in her position I d do it too I tried to strangle myself Obviously didn t work out It left a mark for a few hours and she saw Idk if she noticed or school told her after I d had a break down there It doesn t normally leave a mark but then again I didn t expect to be alive by the end of trying to die She asked me what I used and I told her She asked me what I expected would happen And I said I didn t know because I didn t want to explain What the fuck does she think I didn t do it for fun I did it because I wanted to end my life She keeps on saying what s the point in me hurting myself because I ll just end up with scarr s which will make me uncomfortable in myself when I m older I don t plan on getting older Is it just me that can t seem to control it sometimes That you just act without thinking about the consequences Its in the moment And it s to make yourself feel better in the moment because your in that much fucking pain She thinks she knows how I feel She said she had depression as a kid but she had nobody to go to I asked how she got better and she told me in time but sometimes she still feels depressed She keeps on saying stuff to suggest she s still depressed like I just don t have the energy Maybe she doesn t maybe she does have depression but she doesn t get my exact experience It s funny how she suddenly feels this way since I ve been diagnosed with it Idk weird coincidence or my fault Nobody ever fully will understand I don t understand Because she experienced this she thinks she knows everything about what s going on in my head right now She thinks I can just stop hurting myself That she should be able to just trust me Sometimes I m screaming for help but my mouth won t work and neither will my actions So I m stuck Or I find something to hurt myself with and my mum expects me to give it to her She doesn t get that I m rarely ever in a not suicidal state So the fuck am I going to give whatever I ve found to her if I want to die I hate being around her She could be so much worse But I hate it She thinks she can keep me safe but all she s doing is pushing me away I thought this would bring us closer Because sometimes we have a chat and it s good Every once in a blue moon But lately it s just been torture She s angry if I talk and angry if I don t Everything I do seems to be wrong And not to be big headed but I m a good kid I never answer back got good grades kind to everyone She thinks it was because of loosing friendships that I got severely depressed but I think it s partly because of her A big part I m going to end up running away weeks left of school until summer I plan on running away either from school or in the middle of the night Leaving Hopefully never coming back Finding a way to die because strangling myself and cutting my wrists don t seem to work There s a pier near where I live Maybe I ll jump from there Or a train line Maybe that d be the way And those are so unreliable and hard to get to from where I am but its going to get to that point I never thought it d get to the point where I m trying to hang myself with a scarf but it did All I want is to fucking die To end this torture Get away from my mum Never live another day Not good ones Not bad ones Forever I m tired Physically mentally I don t want to anymore Nor do I believe I can Its been a bad couple of days and it feels like nobody understands how bad its been Tried to end my life the last days Obviously failed And these are genuine attempts Where I ve said my thankyous written my note gotten upset as I tried to do it I probably won t try again for a little while Our of fear of my mum finding out Tbh I hope she looses confidence in keeping me safe It s the only way I ll actually become safer I don t want to be home I don t want to be anywhere I just want to die,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

I thought I was better but I m not I recently graduated college and was discharged from DBT therapy after successfully completing about months of treatment I am officially cured of borderline personality disorder and my depression had decreased to mild However I recently about a month ago started a new job at a winery just planning on making some money while I prepare for law school because I m taking a year off I thought I was doing better but every day when I get up to go to work I hope to god that on my minute commute i ll get head on by another car and either die or end up in the hospital where I don t have to deal with angry clients anymore I have two bosses and theyre like jekyll and hyde if hyde were just incredibly passive aggressive I m so angry because my complaints about my job are so petty but I ve been shaking like trembling from fear and stress at work and having multiple panic attacks a day I take klonopin for anxiety but it s stopped working since I m literally always anxious my mood stabilizer isn t helping either I m supposed to talk to my psychiatrist today or tomorrow but honestly all I want to do is die painlessly quickly and get out of everyone s hair The only reason I didn t do that a very long time ago is that there s never been a right time I want to have everything in order before I do it and i don t want to hurt my loved ones but this is unbearable I can t even complain about my job because people just say everyone has terrible bosses and like ok maybe they do but i feel like all the progress i made in therapy is gone and i m living in this weird fake constructed world that my work tries to create for our clients everything is contradictory and it s too much I can t do this anymore I m leaving for a week after tuesday so i guess i will ahve a little space but I don t even know if I want to give two weeks notice since I m scared I m going to start hurting myself again if I stay Also when I had a medication mishap I had a mental breakdown in front of my boss and my coworkers and i ve been embarrassed ever since I never want to show weakness but there s nowhere I can go to cry in peace on my breaks I never want to go back I never want to leave my bed I want to redacted because i just read the rules,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress",Medium

Is it bad that I don t want help anymore I ve come close to seeking help a few times but always stopped myself because I know getting help would probably reduce my freedom of choice probably harder to buy a gun in Canada after being diagnosed as mentally ill the only things holding me back are what it would do to my family the fact that I feel like I should be grateful for not being born in some hellhole like Africa and just pure resentment But now I have a plan to get a gun and I really don t want anything to do with anybody I want to figure this out on my own I want to decide if I want to live or die not a therapist or some fucking doctor or even my family but me I feel a lot closer to the abyss than I have in the past but want help less and less as time goes by,"Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

Why do the good people die but people who actually want to die live on anyway I think I just want to talk to people My therapist counsellor whatever is currently on vacation so there isn t anyone to really talk to about my thoughts on life Hence the x post The people who have terminal illnesses like cancer and what have you not why are they the ones to be struck by such diseases They have family who love them need them and dreams that they want to accomplish Why is it when we pray so hard to God for a miracle but they wouldn t be healed Why wouldn t it be me depressed person who was critically ill instead I don t deserve this life The closest I came to death was when I OD ed unintentionally or idk maybe up for anyone to judge Felt like crap vomiting multiple times every hour was in the ER sobbing that I am dying and I can t wait for them to take my blood pressure to diagnose me When I blacked out I was encompassed by a warm white light felt so serene and peaceful to not feel anymore pain anymore and I honestly wished it remained like that forever But no I had to wake up and worry about my school project submission and test that I had missed because of the incident Asked my mum if she would be fine if i was gone she said she would accept it I do not want to commit suicide it s a way too painful death OD ing is quite bad too if anyone even considers that I wish somehow I would mysteriously just go back to that serene feeling though instead of having to worry so much about living Don t worry about me I will be fine All i am saying is they deserve second chance in life but I didn t want it and I shouldn t be here,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

I was born a burdenI ve always felt like a burden Whether it be the medical bills to the food to the clothing I ve just always been a detriment to my family I don t live lavishly I let my sister and mother and father live the life they can Part of that life includes reminding me how much money I ve l c ost my parents My mother has always been this way and up until recently I had just had to deal with it I grew depressed and eventually turned to drugs and alcohol However I always kept a fine GPA and stayed in tune with what I was good with and kept working on my various side projects That became too much for me and I looked into moving in with my father for the time being due to the fact that my mother had become unbearable My father a much more timid spirit could continue to talk to me in a serious conversation instead of devolving from worried to screaming like my mother I ve gone to many different therapists to help with family problems depression and some mental troubles I was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier last year and instead of helping me my parents decided it was in their better interests to ignore it and because of this I currently have to wake up in the morning and suffer every second while I m awake until I sleep which turns into a hour turn and toss fest until I wake up and don t have the will to try sleeping again To get to work and school my father helped me buy a car No longer can I tell if he continually reminds me of the car s price and how much he could ve done for himself with the money I want to pay him back as soon as possible but I am in no position to even start dealing with that matter My mother can t be trusted She goes out of her way to make my life harder She will call and text me every hours asking if I m available for dinner or some sort of meeting where when I decide to meet her she will spend as long as she can doing her best to remind me that she gave birth to me and it was the worst mistake in her entire life I no barely eat at this point because I m afraid to walk into the kitchen and make food out of ingredients I didn t purchase and I m barely making enough money to pay for school and gas as it is I cry on average or times a day but I think it s just a bad habit because I haven t gained anything from it yet I still consider suicide every day but it s not feasible when considering the position I am in It s selfish I read that suicide has a greater chance of hurting me long term over killing me If I attempt suicide I d probably mess it up and end up becoming a figure that sits in bed all day and drains my parents money on medical bills If I do somehow succeed with suicide my parents will end up having to pay my funeral expenses At this point in life I m slowly building up the money so I can safely move away and cut all contact with my family Maybe I won t be happy but they can be I m lost,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

I just set everything up for my second attempt and took everything downHi I previously tried back in November by jumping stories and surviving because I fell on a tree but I have brain damage thus I have a lot of trouble using the left side of my body I have some trouble walking and I can lift my left arm to my right shoulder but no more The doctors say I will have permanent damage in my left arm and I may never drink again because of becoming an alcoholic since my brain doesn t have as much control over alcohol as it did before I know I m lucky and the damage could be much worse but I still feel like I fucked myself over for life My girlfriend has been very supportive and has been through it all with me She clearly loves me which I appreciate very much But the real question is how much can she take If she decides that she can t handle this anymore and ends our relationship I really think I ll attempt suicide again and succeed this time Because of this fear I set up my note in the kitchen on my phone with myself beside the stove to emit carbon monoxide indefinitely with no pilot light But I couldn t go through with it for some reason Maybe because of my antidepressants Anyways I just wanted to let everybody know my story and I m still here,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

I want the sadness to endHello r SuicideWatch So I m a year old high school student who has been contemplating suicide lately For the past years I ve felt depressed almost all of the time I can t pinpoint any external factors in my life that might make me feel this way While I ve never been officially diagnosed with clinical depression or anything both of my parents have so I believe it s not too far fetched at all to say I may be genetically predisposed for it or something Some stretches of time have felt harder than others This past week is one of those times I ve had trouble getting to sleep I ve woken up late or early every day I ve had trouble focusing I don t feel engaged in anything I do I can t get myself to do any school work and I ve cried for at least half an hour every day The worst of it all has been the suicidal thoughts I ve unwillingly visualized myself killing myself in various ways The thoughts are simultaneously terrifying and liberating I don t think I have the nerve to act on them but I worry sometimes I ve been taking medication generic Lexapro every day and meeting with a counselor for an hour every week Both of these have a positive impact for sure but I don t know that they re enough I still feel hopeless sometimes like my life isn t worth living I feel miserable The worst part of it is that I feel like nobody would really notice if I did kill myself I feel like those who would notice wouldn t care all that much My mom gets mad at me when all I can do is mope around the house My dad rarely sees me and never seems to take my depression seriously One of my little brothers seems to despise me at worst and feel neutral towards me at best The other is a real sweet heart but said to me earlier today that nobody loves me That got to me All of my friends except for one have grown really distant from me over the past year The only friend I have who makes me feel wanted and loved by somebody has been out of the country for about months and won t return home for about more I don t know if I can last that long I miss her so much I honestly feel like I want to die right now I want the sadness to stop I can t handle it I feel worthless right now Sorry if it seems like I m just seeking attention but I m hoping getting this off my chest will help Any advice support comments etc are appreciated a lot,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
just at a loss So I m at a point where things in my life just seem to be way too ridiculous for me to make any sense of or control I am m and here s some backstory grew up well off but with a case of undiagnosed depression and one of those families that never owned up to just how dysfunctional it really was It was my senior year of high school when all the previously ignored shit finally hit the the proverbial fan though My father lost his job and my parents decided to split My family now just my mother me and two sisters went from living a living a comfortable lifestyle to just making ends meet We moved to a tiny house and my mom was forced to find a job to keep us afloat All throughout this process my depression and anxiety issues start coming to a head I would go to school and just have panic attacks and either just walk around the place aimlessly in a weird haze or skip school altogether to drink or do drugs Eventually I dropped out Ever since then things just got worse and worse I started getting into more serious drugs until I started using strong painkillers and heroin My mother kicked me out and I was forced to move in with my father who sort of lived with his friend My first night there he explains the reason for the divorce was that he explained to my mother that he was in fact a gay man and he couldn t go on living a lie I guess While it made sense and I WAS extremely sympathetic to his coming out I couldn t help but feel alienated and weirded out Also I never really had a great relationship with him in the first place He was never the typical dad and also had his bouts with alcoholism here and there and I honestly didn t really like him for that even in spite of viewing everything now through the lens of his coming out At this point I realized how depressed I was feeling really suicidal daily but I was able to curtail the self abusive thoughts through drugs and alcohol I just sort of did not give a fuck about anything anymore I guess I wasn t in school and couldn t hold down a job and this developed into tension between me my father and his friend Eventually we almost got into physical altercation so I peaced the fuck out of there and went from house to house living with my cousin and other relatives and eventually some girl I was sleeping with at the time One day my ex girlfriend got really concerned because of my depression and drug use and coerced me to check myself into the psych ward at a hospital I did I spend around a week there and they discharge me with an antidepressant perscription I continue to live with said girl whose family actually turns out to be really cool and supportive and things really start to improve for me mental health wise as I stay on the Zoloft I eventually land a job at a pizzeria so my mother decides it s cool if I come back home providing I pay rent I m psyched and things are pretty cool for a while I quit hard drugs and stop hanging out with wasteoids But my medication runs out after a month and I don t have health insurance cause we re poor now Anxiety comes back tenfold and I just cant take working at the stressful pizzeria anymore so I stop showing up I try to explain to my mother what s up with my depression and anxiety but she just doesnt get it and thinks I m a wimp She finally agrees to pay out of pocket for a psych appointment so I can get new perscriptions but does so grudgingly and always uses that to sort of hold over my head This was about a month ago My medication is about to run out again and I still cant find a new job Everyday my mother comes home from work pissed and apparently now I have until the second of November to give her rent money or she ll drop me off at the social services building She doesnt fuck around It s been months but I m starting to feel real self loathing again and I feel like the only option I really have is to just sorta check out or get into hard drugs again I realize that was a lot to read and yeah it does seem like the plot to a bad coming of age tale kind of thing or some shit but this is what s up for me right now I figured I d try to bounce this off of some complete strangers to see if there are any suggestions solutions to my bullshit other than self harm Anything in response is both unexpected and appreciated So yeah,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
A Story the quest for love has taken it s tollYou have heard the expression it s better to have loved and loss than never to have loved at all Lies what folk often forget is the psychological and emotional toll that multiple failed relationships has on people each one chips away at your mental health and adds baggage that stays with you for most of your life I have no idea what day it is today but I start each morning with tears flooding my face and a crippling desire to not exist anymore I d like to drop my life story here on the offhand that someone somewhere reads this and can relate with me on some level throwaway for good measure brace yourself for a really long read location UK NO Early life I was lucky enough that my family could afford to place me in a posh private school for pretentious wizards Unfortunately this education was wasted on me as my depression unwillingly began when I was thirteen years old yet I could not comprehend what depression was at this age I was also addicted to the video game world of warcraft WoW Both the cloudyness of being down and the constant thought of when can I get home for my fix left me void of motivation to partake in education University life I had zero social skills due to days I had racked up in WoW but somehow managed to land a girl from a club let s call her X X was half British and half Norwegian she was shy family orientated and equally inexperienced in life We did nothing but watch TV the rest of this chapter is boring let s fast forward UK worklife Through the aid of a lecturer I scored a job working for a top US ISP in a data centre hours north where I lived the city was dirty and work gave me crippling anxiety When you re anxious depressed your judgement is clouded colors are less vivid and all food tastes the same I constantly made elementary mistakes which only made the anxiety and depression worse I never focused in school and the stimulation from gaming destroyed my attention span Four years past and although she never vocalize these words X really wanted to start a family X was also an engineer and quite intelligent We had spontaneous intercourse one night and later I worried it could lead to a pregnancy she reassured me it was impossible on her current cycle I return after a twelve hour night shift to discover a positive pregnancy test prominently left on the bathroom counter I was twenty one years old with no life experience shocked and dismayed did I even love X or did I simply love the security a relationship brings I push for an abortion and she reluctantly agrees I know I m an asshole Things get weird nothing is familiar anymore I m tired of my job hate the dirty city and pose the idea to X that we move to Norway she s fluent I m lost what could go wrong Grand adventure I got a job for another US tech company before leaving UK we travel to Oslo with our possessions and Gandalf the dog and ferry and drive our way across UK up Denmark and across to Norway I did not integrate well mostly my fault and the fact we moved based on a semi ultimatum X is unemployed for months We had been dating six years at this point I had an emerald engagement ring X finally gets a programmer job but cheats on me with the guy twice her age who mentored her I spiral hard new country confused lost heartbroken they speak great English in Norway but I didn t know any Norwegian and this blew my anxiety and depression up I drink for a week straight I got into bitcoin and crypto mining as a hobby before it exploded then I discovered this could be used to buy narcotics off the darkweb Twenty six years old and I d never touched a cigarette or drugs other than alcohol I buy benzodiazepines off the darknet This opened the floodgates as it temporarily cured my issues and my quest was to try the rest V Before online dating turned to shit I met V half Norwegian half American lots of fun I kept up the drug routine and expanded my desk draw with a variety of disassociatives psychadelics depressants and stimulants I wanted to move to California with V as our vacations there were eye opening I got denied after roughly job applications serendipitously I got a targeted email from a renowned tech company doing R amp D work in the video conferencing market dream company and dream job depression and anxiety prevail V and I still had fun but I went crazy and occasionally psychotic I pushed V away and we split and then realised I was back to square X this prompted my first suicide attempt using a litre of sambuca mg diazapam and a gram of mdma in the hopes my organs would cook whilst I was in a benzo sleep state I took the pills and put the bottle to my head I passed out before I could reach for the mdma baggy I woke up in hospital ICU hours later When I woke the first thing I tried to do is strangle myself with the beeping machines power cable staff intervened and I was placed in a psych ward for a while The dream The job was perfect I should be happy I was under qualifyied but these people enjoy the stories and bullshit I spew in interviews Two years pass nothing changes I m lonely abuse takes over Usual life is pointless angle I ve tested all the drugs at this point except opioids I order heroin with the sole intention of permanent overdose No toleranse I snort there entire bag I sink into my bed no further I sank through the ground and down into the earth s crust It felt horrible A part of me didn t want to die just sleep forever I call my Swedish friend and explain the overdose he calls and ambulance Hell I wake up in hospital very psychotic everyone is trying to kill me the walls are caving in and extremely colorful smoke floods the room the tv gives reports of a male rapist and the possible suspect is me I feel the hospital is in on the jig and see them trying to take DNA from me blood in an attempt to frame me for this non existed crime why would Norwegian news be in English One night I escape I run far but I don t know where I am or how to navigate the hospital security track me down and escort me back to my bed The next day a tall in stature ripped private security guard appears at my door Yes Finally protection from the nurses with no faces and the snipers outside that I ve been ducking all week Wrong so so wrong I later found out he was there to stop me escaping and to protect the staff from me I cried in broad daylight when I figured this out Doctors told me they ran MRI s in the extended duration I was unconscious to check for brain activity no dignity left at this point Fast forward back to the psych ward familiar faces Realization I was staying in this country simply for the job yet I was still insanely depressed lonely and no ambition to integrate with the knowledge of the fact that I m here only because of X I met another girl called Y we bonded over drugs unfortunately this is what my life has become she was nice but attraction faded we lived together for six months on and off work was getting more intense I was making more mistakes due to the usual three things Y had a hash smoking habit we smoked a lot but I couldn t handle the pressure anymore and I decide to move back to England Familiar land My tech job and incredible manager let me teleconference work from home for a bit whilst I landed on my feet Problem is I never landed I stayed with my mom for a bit she has bipolar and schizophrenia This is after my parents divorce my dad was an esteemed doctor saw the signs tried his best but couldn t help as she did not believe there was a problem but everyone else is looking at the fucking huge elephant in the room I m talking about the mental health stigma not my mom she s only mildly obese She is money obsessed she divorced my dad for cash She knew I had an engineer job and wanted me to fund renovations on the house she got from the cash split in the divorce I did not oblige and called her irrational over some remarks she made Her response was well atleast I haven t been in as many psych wards as you I got mad and flipped a table in the hall nothing got damaged heated reaction She called the police on me for not paying her lifestyle or making noise Anyway her property her rules the really friendly and pretty cool police obliged and drove me to my dad at a secret location due to being afraid of what my mom is capable of I don t want to go down this road but my father lives a lot of secrecy and I could write a book on the psychology that binds his half of the family together New beginnings I rush and find rented accommodation Things seem good I meet a new girl Z Now Z is incredibly rude but I was attracted to her dark and dirty side Relationship moves fast she drunkenly says I love you multiple times but then forgets it happened at the two week mark I meet her entire family we argued over some trivial things she also lived minutes from my home she broke it off after a pitiful six weeks I make new guy friends and the next months go well However depression kicks in full drive I can t focus function I just want sleep or constant sleep I order a bunch of oxy and heroin and this is attempt four shan t speak of three as it was really dumb I nodded out and awake god knows how many hours later which is really confusing and at the time more depressing I can t even off myself how depressing is that I was out for a very long period of time and developed a blood clot or some issue requiring ultrasounds and blood thinners on my leg The next two months were painful Goodbye Tech last October I just couldn t handle the stress anxiety guilt of underperforming so on and so forth So I yolo resigned and went travelling I went through Japan and I went to one of my best friends who lives in Washington US I had an incredible time my friend in US understands me on all levels but our time came to and end I m back home the past three months have been spent laying in my bed in my room abusing myself with zero ambition to even search for a job whilst burning through my savings These four walls will be the death of me I m in therapy once a week by choice this time and I self medicate because I m not only an armchair psychologist but also an armchair pharmacist There are many stories omitted from this quasi autobiography but consider it easy steps to fuk your life There s a scene in Fight Club where the plane

BF Constantly Threatening SuicideSo I m a little nervous about making this post because I don t really want to be found out but this is beyond my understanding anymore The man I have dated for a long time is a widely intelligent attractive man In the beginning it was pure magic We spent a lot of time together we went out on dates etc Then I moved to college and came back home It was toward the end of last year that this all began Out of nowhere he started threatening to hang himself because I was being negative While I ve always known to take threats seriously I kinda let it slide because maybe I pissed him off and didn t realize it He blames me for being negative and a drama queen and this is causing him to want to kill himself I know this isn t the full story I know there must be something else going on At the end of the day I am not responsible for his suicide I am not legally bound to him in any way Problems got worse when one day he came over and we were fighting about something stupid The fight rose to the point where he is screaming at me saying I am going to hurt you and me begging him not to touch me Eventually he grabbed me called me stupid among other things I cowered and threw my hands over my face attempting to shield myself thinking he was actually going to strike But he threw me aside I begged him to calm down and he wasn t being rational He finally agreed to relax but then started screaming again At this point he was thrown out for threatening me Fast forward Most days it is ok I don t hear from him much and try to give him space to work on his projects but these episodes of suicide can occur when I least expect it At times he told me he had a rope and made a noose out of it He tried it and caused harm to himself apparently I honestly believe that some of this is false The other day I fell asleep on him and he told me he still had the noose in his closet if I don t stop being negative The problem with all of this is that it is starting to affect my level of sanity If I don t hear from him for like half a day I immediately start thinking he has hurt himself I know you ll day get rid of him I am just wondering if there is a real way to diagnose the problem I wish I knew what to do,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
I feel rejected by the system and I don t know where else to turnI don t really know where to start because I feel like I ve been on this roundabout for a little while now I dealt with a fair bit of bullying and family issues divorce DV as a child young teen This made me feel quite anxious for a few years and this is where I first started with psychology It really helped me for a while but the anxiety slowly faded away and was replaced by depression I d say for about three years now I ve been really depressed It s hard to tell because you don t really know how bad it is until you re through it I guess has been horrible for me It s been difficult to do anything so my grades have slipped really badly I ve tried to kill myself four times this year all with some form of drug and alcohol It s usually messy but I guess when you re that impaired that you don t have a filter it gets a lot messier when you say things you regret to family and friends I deserve it but now most of my family and friends have desserted me too I don t blame them because honestly I ve been horrible The last time I tried was about three months ago now It was at my university campus and there were posts to the facebook student group while I was in my impaired state I didn t intend on doing that nor do I know why I did The result was that I was found after a goose chase with security and was arrested and taken to hospital Of course it was just like the other times I was drunk so they assume I wasn t really depressed and that I was horrible for doing what I did I was placed in a room and I wasn t allowed to see anyone or have my phone I had to beg a doctor for help and that was when I finally got some antidepressants I d been on them before but it was too expensive to keep seeing my psychiatrist I was finally released and it turns out I sent some pretty embarrassing and inappropriate emails to one of my favourite lecturers who I really looked up to That really made me upset by putting someone in that position I ve apologised and since haven t got a response even though I know he shouldn t have to it s a professional setting you know even though he said he s always there to talk if I need it It really hurts because even though he was purely a teacher he was one of the few people that I really trusted and I felt was there for me Depression makes you get attached to people I guess The posts were visible to everybody so whenever I step on campus I get a lot of bullying about it now too So I m too scared to go back I know my mum has had it to because last time we fought she said she was too tired of worrying about me and that I should just do it because she needs closure I know she didn t mean it but it really hurts But the worst part is the hospitals I m always treated like a criminal I m always hated by the nurses and doctors And I stress so much about previous experiences there that I can hardly bring myself to go to a doctor or talk to a counsellor just in case I say something too worrying I feel completely rejected by the medical people that are there to help as well as everybody who has said they care I ve been on these new medication for about three months now I feel less depressed I can get up in the morning and stuff like that But the suicidal urges are still here They re so strong I have to self harm just to get rid of them I m so worried about it And the worst part is that I know if I do it again I m going to make sure that I succeed because I can t deal with the hospital again I m worried that I m going to hurt myself I don t want to but I don t see any other option at this point Please help me,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

Alternatives to seeking help Hey so over the summer there have been longer times sometimes over several weeks where I ve felt what must be almost completely normal I had an almost positive or at least hopefull view of my future things interested me again and I got like a spark in my soul to do things I could talk to people and handle conflicts without any issues or anxiety and even heavily boosted my confidence from any social contacts What struck me the most was that I went to sleep at peace every night confident even an looking forward to the next day Anyway well that s all gone now and my depressed shitty thoughts torment me all night and the thought of suicide lingers in the back of my head all day which I mostly spend doing absolutely nothing and having anxiety now from all social contact even social mistakes I might have made during the time I felt better I know now that I can t escape this on my own I just accidentally stumbled into having a few good weeks by some lucky coincidences in my life and since that s all gone now I know I need outside help amp nbsp amp nbsp If you want to stop reading right here the problem in a nutshell is that I have from experience lost all faith and respect for professional psychiatry psycology Does anyone now of any kind of alternatives that doesn t require me to spill my soul out to any person or therapist who would most likely be incompetent won t have the time just wants to get my money while doing as little as possible amp nbsp amp nbsp The long story is I tried getting help a long time ago when my depression forced me to quit med school before even the first tests of the first term I went to the state health provider in my country and just got worse from it They made me see different doctors at each appointment every one of which needed to hear my story from the start which I really hated to tell people I had just met My meds where changed almost every second week for no reason since the antidepressants I mostly got need around a month to even show effect After around a month and a half of this I tried to kill myself with prescribed anti anxiety meds and alcohol woke up in the hospital where a new psychiatrist made me promise to her personally that I would not kill myself until I came to see her again two days later I did but she was apparently busy walked past me in the waiting hall without acknowledging me so I got to meet a fourth year med student this time doing her clinical experience time or something She drilled me about if med school was too hard for me I told her no since we hadn t even reached the first exams yet but she ended up writing that as the probable cause on my medical papers anyway For me this was like a fellow med student writing I was literally shit on official papers any kind of confidence I had completely destroyed and I just felt abandoned by the whole thing So a few weeks later when a different doctor forgot to set up a new appointment before which another doctor had refilled my prescription for the same anti anxiety meds while saying no joke you must have run out of them by now I just allowed myself to slip through their cracks and disappear amp nbsp Around six months later I tried to get help again from a private psychiatrist which felt like it was going well I got the meet the same person every week and got to know him and felt confidence in him and everything I told him how I was feeling every week and while he couldn t pinpoint a cause or a solution I thought he was working towards something Until one day shit hit the fan completely and I got really really suicidal I went to the next appointment with my parents and he told me he couldn t help me anymore I was too serious For the several months I had been going to him and assuming he knew what he was doing and working towards something with the questions he was asking he actaully had no idea but didn t think to mention it until I got really suicidal again and was a danger to becoming a bad statistic in his records I got the blame both from him and my parents since if I really had been honest with him he would have known I would be getting seriously suicidal again before it happened My parents actually chalked up the failure of the state health provider to mostly be because of me not being honest and cooperative enough with them too after this amp nbsp amp nbsp So if any of you read all the way here you know why I don t want to get back into any of this shit again it only made me worse But now I m feeling suicidal and shitty again and I know I can t fix it by myself so what other options do I have,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
It s ready to go It s just not the right place I m sat with my end plan in front of me Healthcare professionals have told me it s foolproof I could be gone in two hours The only thing stopping me is I m currently staying with my parents and it s unfair for them to be the ones to find me I could be gone within two hours and I just want to not be here anymore Childhood trauma fucked me up Being raped when I was a kid has fucked all my chances of being in a healthy relationship because eventually people get sick of me not being able to fake a smile and realise that no matter how happy they might be able to make me it never lasts I ll be back into a rut where I can t get out of bed or shower or drink water or eat Drugs used to help me escape but I m just not wanting a temporary escape I just want out The last time I attempted I didn t succeed and I was in a much better place back then I wish I could be as fortunate as I was then but I just keep experiencing trauma and I can t be fixed anymore Multiple therapists have had to give up on me because they just can t help Antidepressants haven t ever worked I ve been on fluoxetine sertraline mirtazapine citalopram and venlafaxine Nada No help I stuck to docs dosage schedules I ve had doses raised I ve tried different types of specialist therapies and nothing works Nothing can stop the shit I m going through because it s not possible to change The pain is intolerable The flashbacks are intolerable I dissociate so much I m missing out on all things important I keep getting told things will get better but without fail life just gets harder and harder to cope with I don t think I m going to see the end of the year through I guess year old me was right I wasn t going to live past the age of after all,"Maladaptive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

I feel like I can t figure things out anymore I went on anxiety medication and I ve been on it for two months and what I think is getting better is my ability to go through the motions of life that I didn t want to do before Physically I feel better I ve been running and eating healthier and taking an interest again in my appearance and my health but I still don t feel right I m still really angry all the time and I m still suicidal but since I started the medication I m absolutely terrified of dying I don t know if that s a good thing or a bad thing right now it keeps me from attempting suicide but I can t really be sure in the long run I ve also developed stomach problems that so far haven t been diagnosed I ve seen a gastroenterologist and about other doctors for a while now and nothing My stomach hurts all the time regardless of what I eat I ve tried everything in the book and multiple medications It just seems crazy that this problem could be going on for so long I just don t know what to do I really don t have anyone I can talk to about this My parents have already told me that they don t approve of me being on anxiety medication and they ve already told me how they think anxiety disorders are bullshit My husband has only been angry with me recently because I ve been isolating myself from everyone I only have one friend who I haven t spoken to in nearly a month I don t really know who to turn to I guess Thanks for listening to me rant If anyone can talk with me that would be great,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
I just want to stop hurting Female I m really scared I have a wonderful boyfriend whom I love with everything I can muster He is just an amazing amazing person and I love having him in my life I put him on a bit of a pedestal but I really just have a strong admiration for his character I respect him a lot And on good days we have a lot of fun together I love spending time with him But I m sad I m just always sad And nothing he does seems to make it stop I don t want to try new things Or even if I really do want to I feel physically sick if he tries to pull me out of my comfort zone at all My comfort zone is usually my bed or his with a laptop and whatever food I m craving at the time Fine in moderation but this is no way to live life I don t want to spend my youth wasting away in front of a computer But the second he comes up with an idea even if I m all gung ho about it the headaches and stomach cramps start anxiety kicks in and I just want to go home It makes him miserable I know it does What a weight to put on the one you love He s very social and I love that about him but I m so anxious around people that I m uncomfortable in crowds But then I get jealous and feel rejected if he tries to go out and have fun on his own I feel ashamed that I m not better for him I want to be the social butterfly I once was I want to put myself out there and relax and have a good time I want him to see that side of me and fall in love with me all over again but it never works Even when I m putting on a happy face he knows it s not real In general I feel insecure like I m just not good enough for him Deep down I know that this person isn t me I feel like I m trapped in the body of someone who is depressed and I feel so powerless The past several weeks he s started to express his worry about our fundamental differences my need for comfort and his love of the unfamiliar He thrives off adventure he loves not knowing what a day will bring But in order to keep from freaking out I need things to be planned and prepared and cautious We love eachother but this is a major major deal breaker I would love to relax and let go and go on adventures with him I have always wanted to travel and eat strange foods and meet interesting people but I feel like I just don t have the strength Knowing this he feels it s best to call it quits He wants to live his life and I am holding him back He has tried to break up with me at least twice this month I don t know what to do All I can do is cry I ran the sharp edge of a pocketknife down my arm tonight and it felt like a small release I don t know anything that I m doing in my life I feel like this is all there is I can t pull myself out of this depression and I m tearing him down with me I have no close friends no job couldn t put the effort into any degree and dropped out I m stuck in this small town We were supposed to move to another city together and start over but now he thinks it s best to go alone He s going to leave me He was the love of my life and I wrecked it I just don t see the point in living anymore I can t try any more It s too much EDIT I woke up this morning and read all of your replies and cried again because I m so grateful It just feels so good to know that it s not over I have a doctor s appointment in two hours so I will be back to let you know what she says I m nervous as hell and I can t stop thinking about my boyfriend but I need to plug through this day Thank you so much for responding to me It must get overwhelming in this subreddit but I feel like I came to the right place EDIT Well I went to the doctor and she diagnosed me as clinically depressed She gave me a prescription for Cipralex which I start tomorrow I m going to try to kick this I m going to try to be my own person again Thank you for your encouragement and support It means the world to me right now,"Mental Distress, Progress Update, Cause of Distress",Medium

I spun my web to perfection Now I am terrified of it So I am not expecting pity or remorse here Simply want to get this off my chest So long story short I was diagnosed with a form of cancer I received treatment and It was pretty much handled before it could grow to an extent to cause me problems I handled this entirely on my own and despite living in the same small town as my family that didn t actually hear about it until after I had received treatment I have always Bluntly wanted to die I have no interests I have no passion Perfection to me is sleep Literally I am pretty much certain I am a sociopath to some degree I think of myself as the lowest form of human possible I grew up very close in terms of relationship to my grandparents Upon each of their deaths my thoughts immediately went to Sweet I can use this as an excuse to get away with being lazy followed by For that to work people actually have to think I am sad I better mope around a bit publically My personality is garbage I haven t been interested in anything whatso ever since I was and I have no issue manipulating anyone and everyone that I can to purely benefit myself HELL I DID MONTHS CHARITY WORK SO I COULD HAVE A GOOD CHARACTER WITNESS FOR A CERTAIN EVENT WHICH I PREDICTED WOULD LAND ME IN COURT Now we have established my deplorable nature The story you all want regarding my current situation I decided that the fact my family had began the grieving process regarding me having cancer I could seize this opportunity to commit and acceptable suicide So over the last months I have spun an intricate web of lies to create a story of failing health which hell I even managed to get my lawyer to believe I have filed certain forms which upon religious grounds will greatly limit autopsy prying I have sorted out how I will be found etc All that is left now is to die and my web of lies will cushion the fall for my family Again I wish I could say it was for my families benefit however that is a side effect My real merit is knowing that I will die a death which people will understand and consider acceptable thus not diminishing my character All that is left now is to leave and here comes the part that is absolutely hilarious I AM FUCKING TERRIFIED OF DYING NOW I have no issue dealing with the pain and I know it is most likely anxiety but jesus I am literally shaking in fear Again I don t expect Nor want Feelings of pity Hatred if you must I already know that I am literal garbage in every sense I just thought I may as well share my tale before I go,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High
I need immediate help I m a year old boy and have been heavily depressed and suicidal since I was when I for the first time tried hanging myself I ve been seeking help since age but with no great succes For the last years I ve failed different educations because of my mental condition which is slowly tearing me apart I am constantly imagining guns to my head ropes around my neck the ground smashing my body etc and it haunts me even when I m in a somewhat good mood About a year ago when I help finally came I was by mistake diagnosed as a schizophrenic I had to walk around with this dagnosis hanging over my head and swallow anti psychotics that would eventually make me fall asleep in the middle of every morning classes After a half year I demanded a new diagnosis because I ve NEVER been psychotic After a single conversation with a leading doctor I was diagnosed with dystymia and heavy depressions I was prescribed prozac and when I started on mg things suddenly became joyful I was open hearted I was happy and I had confidence While everything suddenly was going well I decided to drop acid with some friends all of us with an already daily usage of cannabis It was wonderful and for the next weeks I was happy I dumped by girlfriend through years at the time I was certain that I would start from scratch All of a sudden girls were attracted to me I had no problems getting laid and my friends jealousy was a sign to me that I was on the right track I was sure that the days of my suffering had end and I could finally be happy For some reason ONE weekend could destroy all those thoughts I ve had the best days of school ever As another weekend approached everything went great But after the weekend I was back in school and NO ONE seemed as happy as me Suddenly depression hit me I was lonely again Yeah I was happy but no one around me were Ever since then I ve been extremely depressed I m losing friends and I m losing my grip It seems to all start over again For the last month I ve tried suicide times Last time yesterday My only will is to die in peace I am a lonely soul,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High

Hello I don t want to be dramatic in this post it s not in my nature Instead I m going to talk out my plans why I feel this way and maybe have someone to talk to about it I m not looking to be diagnosed or be a patient to a therapist But just talk When I was years old my parents had their third child I was their first and I am their big brother They annoyed me and I annoyed them still do But they re my siblings and I love them A few months after my third sibling was born I started having these thoughts Terrible thoughts of ending my life at this very young age I had no friends I had no life I didn t do well in school and my parents always fought while I took care of my siblings I am now and my parents have long been divorced my dad literally proposed to his girlfriend just days ago She said yes and things are great for them and my siblings In fact I have three more little rugrats joining the family as my mom is currently pregnant with her boyfriend s third child I am still the oldest When I was years old i wanted to die But I didn t I stayed alive to protect my siblings However I said to myself that when I turn on that very day in September when my body turns years old I will end it all That is in years and I don t think I can do it I am not happy with my life I have a dead end job I didn t graduate high school I have friends which are more or less just people I hang out with and I have no concept of what my future contains But I don t want to die Yet I want to end my life on my birthday at PM on an age that is satisfactory for me Like or So far seems to be the winning number But the only thing that could possibly stop me from this is one thing A girl The brown eyed black haired girl I met in middle school She had a huge crush on me and when I asked her to dance at our graduation dance from middle school to high school she cried She even said at one point that she would marry me if we could I was too much in my own head to conceive this Hey a girl ACTUALLY likes me Cool I should date her was my thought process And while what we did throughout months of high school wasn t as much dating and more of acting like close friends I loved it But then I ruined my life by breaking up with her I just don t like her that way anymore I said When really the drama in my family with my parents divorce and my internal conflict of wanting to die was the answer I want to try again with the brown eyed girl as adults We still speak on a bi daily basis and it s to the point where she actually said I m her best friend I ve dreamed of proposing to her at Disney world after the fireworks have ended and watching her cry as she tried to mutter the words yes This is her perfect proposal A perfect proposal for a perfect wife to be But that is just a fairy tale The girl ignores me when I try to ask her for coffee or makes up some excuse as to why she can t go I want to understand and say well maybe she s telling the truth but in reality I know she flat out doesn t want to Well that s it I m resisting the urge to look over and reword the mess I spilled out over my keyboard but these are my naked thoughts I am most likely going to die in September of Anyone wanna chat,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",High

I m having a really hard time convincing myself to keep going I ll try to keep this brief About years ago I decided to try and turn my life around I went back to school and moved to another state to return to school While there I lost lbs decided to pursue a professional degree i e like an MD made some wonderful friends and had a couple of very meaningful relationships Fast forward to the end of my time there and I had been accepted into the top schools in the country and was just finishing up my studies I decided to end my relationship of years with a girl for both good and bad reasons but ultimately I ve come to regret that decision Without going into details I have a hard time forming connections with others so being able to get that close with someone is something very special I decided to go to the school closest to my home because I was feeling homesick at the time due to being away for nearly years When I arrived I was lonely and a little out of shape but excited to start school Things were going well until midway through the first year a classmate of mine nearly attempted suicide himself he had brought a gun into his dorm and was going to shoot himself I convinced him no to do it and went with him to the counselor the next day For whatever reason this had a profound impact on me and sent me into a depression I started seeing a therapist myself and hired a private trainer at the school gym to try and get myself back in shape and address my feelings Things were going OK for the most part going into the second year of my schooling I was very lonely and somewhat disappointed with my choice in school but otherwise I was looking forward to the future because I was cultivating some interesting hobbies I was enjoying working out rock climbing guitar drawing and kayaking During the Christmas break of that year I fell and injured both of my wrists snowboarding for the first time I didn t think much of it at the time but after a month they still hurt and felt unstable I got diagnosed with a torn ligament in my wrist and a couple other complications I was unable to workout like I normally would due to this injury I refocused on school and spent my time there I also got a highly coveted internship at a local hospital When I wasn t focused on my studies my mind dwelled on my wrist I decided to try and rehab my knee I had slightly injured it the summer before I started professional school but I ended up injuring my wrist further doing an exercise the PT had me do Frustrated I gave up trying to rehab my knee At the start of the third year in pharmacy school I had worked during the summer and also done research on the side My health had deteriorated due to not working out and some stress eating The school I chose proved to be a massive disappointment with a disconnected administration filler classes and a seemingly glaring neglect of fundamental concepts I slogged through the year my health concerns continuing to to weigh heavily on me my TMJ became particularly worse and I injured my other wrist I decided in December to leave my internship which was upsetting me and to try pilates as an alternative workout Now I ve found that due to a defect in my hip I have torn cartilage there as well in addition to knee and ankle problems The surgical outcomes for my hip seem more optimistic than my wrist but I m scared of surgery because of past experiences and I m losing a lot of faith in modern medicine I ve tried pursuing relationships during school but as I said earlier I have trouble with trust and I also feel myself pulling back because my health concerns might limit me It also depresses me that the person I end up with will see me as this broken thing and not the driven hard working capable person I was and was trying hard to improve In addition to my health problems I am having difficulty finding more interests to pursue Writing drawing hurts my wrist as does playing guitar I had wanted to hike and backpack more maybe even run but my hip is making that unlikely I also developed a condition known as slipping rib syndrome which makes certain actions very painful difficult I feel like I tried so hard to change who I was years ago and that it s all going to be for nothing I cultivated new interests that I can t do I m stuck at a school I hate taking on debt for something I ve lost the passion in and I am having difficulty romantically because I feel like I can t form a relationship with someone that I d want to because I don t think my health will allow a future with them In a nut shell I feel like I ve lost my identity and died I ve tried several alternatives to try and pick myself up but I seem to keep hitting roadblocks I went from an active person to nearly completely sedentary and my health seems to be deteriorating at a rapid rate with no definitive answers I think of killing myself multiple times a day but what stops me is that I keep hoping I ll get better It has been over a year since I ve injured my wrist and no doctor has given me a definitive treatment answer that I am satisfied with they just seem to go through treatment algorithms rather than think of mine case as unique Now with my hip knee ankle injury I m rapidly losing hope that I ll ever be able to enjoy my life when I m done with schooling Thank you for reading this I m sorry it was so long I just feel like I need someone to understand how hard I have tried and how desperate I m starting to feel I feel so lost and overwhelmed that I can t pull myself out of this I wish someone was there just to feel close to,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",High
