 by the time it was 430 i was still doing my hair and makeup i let my mom know and she said that her and my dad were leaving and that i could uber myself there i felt really sad and embarrassed but understood 
 
 i know it was my fault and she has every right to do that a part of me still feels sad she did that on my birthday it was a really low key dinner with just the 3 of us at a restaurant down the street i felt like we wouldâ€™ve been fine if we left at 5 and still gotten seated 
 
 her strict punctuality has always brought me stress in my life and it doesnâ€™t help having severe depression and anxiety iâ€™ve always struggled with time and iâ€™m always anxious about because of her also different places and people have varying attitudes towards time for example my friends arenâ€™t punctual at all like if weâ€™re getting together at 6 we all know that technically means 6307 thatâ€™s just how we are my dadâ€™s side of the family are laid back about time too and are not punctual",Cause of Distress; Seeking Help,Low

"a sick relative is causing me severe stress iâ€™m hoping i can post this anonymously so no one close to me can find it but i really donâ€™t know what else to do as everyone i talk to seems to tell me the same old crap that doesnâ€™t comfort me at all for context i am autistic and i donâ€™t like change in routine or bad things happening i also suffered a major trauma from a surgery i had 15 years ago and have gotten ptsd from it this also seems to happen whenever someone close to me is sick varying from mild to severe like this 
 
 so my mom has an infection she got it checked out and has been in the hospital ever since kept getting told it was nothing then got a text thursday night 8pm saying she was scheduled for surgery on it of course this sent me into overdrive and i was screaming down the phone to her saying to come home she had the doctor on the phone to me who said it was gonna be sepsis and there may be a need for amputation well of course this has led to me having panic attacks and everything i got sent home from work 
 i went to drop a few things off friday thinking that i was able to pick her up at dinner time just like i was told on the phone that was the next lie i was also refused entry to the room and had my things snatched from me and taken due to a panic attack i was told sheâ€™d come home at 8pm i was not corrected when i asked if amputation was needed or even necessary so this led to more worry on the way home 
 8pm arrives and i text momma to see if she wanted collecting and i get told no freaking no after i was told to my face to return at 8pm this was friday night and iâ€™m sure they knew exactly what they was doing because it escalates they say she can go home saturday 
 saturday i ask once again what time will momma be coming home and i get told once again midday i was at pride and thought cool theyâ€™ll be home when iâ€™m home oh no i get yet another text saying theyâ€™re not allowed to do any releases until monday despite saying that the infection had gone and stuff so i waited until monday monday rolls around and i ask once again what time i go into work trying to be normal i get a text at work telling me that the infection had never gone and wasnâ€™t allowed back for the 5th time itâ€™s now tuesday and i have been given the same crap i get every day a constant cycle of yes in the morning no in the evening i feel like iâ€™m not being told everything 
 
 this has caused me so much stress itâ€™s unreal first the nurses told my mom i was making things up and denied they said anything about sepsis or whatever they also havenâ€™t made me feel at ease at all lying to momma about going home then an hour later saying no for 5 days me and mom have gotten into arguments and then hours later iâ€™ll be on the phone sobbing and apologising like crazy only to be lied to again or the doctor not doing a release which starts the cycle again 
 
 i havenâ€™t eaten since saturday iâ€™ve not left the house in 2 days iâ€™m signed off sick from work for a week i canâ€™t stop crying my chest is so tight it hurts i have heart palpitations iâ€™m vomiting every time i try and put food in my mouth i have daily nosebleeds i have a constant sense of doom and if i donâ€™t get a text atleast once a day i automatically assume that something bad has happened 
 
 i just want to know is this panic all from past trauma i seem to freak out if anyone close to me has to be in the hospital for a period and itâ€™s to the point where iâ€™m getting sick over it constantly begging the person to come back home where it is â€œsafe from things like surgery and icuâ€ itâ€™s always the worst case that i fear and i even fear death everyone says itâ€™s too much tv but i canâ€™t even watch anything about medical stuff as it induces the same stress i googled about it being a severe fear or a trauma response but honestly i donâ€™t know i just want to know why i was lied to but no one will tell me",Mental Distress; Positive Coping; Seeking Help,Low

"stuck for weeks hello i would like to preface this spiel by explaining what i mean by being stuck two weeks ago i had an episode before a test which i rarely if ever get i originally thought it was a bad panic attack characterized by rls heart palpitations constant perspiration and extreme issues concentrating and even being slightly incoherent the test passed i even got a good grade but the feeling still remained days after i feel it slowly going away 2 weeks after the fact but itâ€™s at a rate that is annoying since it feels like barely anything is helping 
 on the third day of waking up then going to bed extremely anxious and on the verge of a panic attack i went to my general doctor from there they prescribed me 5mg xanax twice daily as needed the alprazolam did not help it just dampened the sense of panic and i still had most of my physical symptoms 
 
 my question to everyone who reads this is â€œwhat do you do to mitigate these annoying side effects and are there any natural remediesâ€
 
 ps iâ€™m on gabapentin 300mg 3x a day propanalol 30mg twice daily guanfacine 3mg er lexapro 30mg and trazadone 50mg all of which did nothing to help with these feelings the past two weeks",Mental Distress; Mood Tracking; Seeking Help,Low

"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why","Mental Distress, Causes of Distress, Seeking Help",Medium
"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything.

If they divorce I do not know what side to take, but I know them well enough to tell that they will make me choose one.I am well aware that divorced parents is a very common thing. I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other, but clearly I was far from right.

Even if I have a job, I find it meaningless too, to wake up at 7am for a 9am job, reaches home at 7pm, only a few hours left to do my stuff and then sleeping early cos you got to get up early next day again, that goes on for the rest of my life which I do not like it at all. I tried to sell some stuff online to support myself financially, but that is not working out. Now that our breadwinner has passed on, we are left with a huge debt for housing loan, and also suffering from monthly utilities bills. Family and relatives only tell me to go out to work so that I can have an income to support the family. Others look down on me. Since I am so useless, I am slowly losing my will to live. I just want to leave and go to a happier world. Slowly losing my will to survive, do I have anymore reasons to live on?","Mental Distress, Causes of Distress",Medium

"I have had a funny feeling lately. Kind of unusual. Its like I woke up from a nap kind of late after a long day of work.When I awoke it was already dark, and suddenly my dark apartment felt extremely dark. And the Normal solitude I am accustomed to became so intolerable. It almost felt like a panic attack in a way.Yet my heart was not racing. Yet I felt on edge, and so so very alone.I busied myself with some quick chores. Suddenly a friend of mine messaged and I messaged them back quickly. They even called and its like I was so thrilled to talk with them for awhile and the feeling began to fade.I just do not understand it well.I have lived alone for several years nowand I am accustomed to it even prefer it at times.And yet waking up suddenly this evening the feeling of being alone felt like a prison. Completely intolerable.I was curious if anyone has ever felt anything like that. I know I have been a bit depressed latelyIm wondering if some of my anxiety symptoms are returning perhaps in a different way.

"I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless, I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sh*t","Mental Distress, Causes of Distress",Medium

I am a make and I am 16 and I just broke up with my gf. When I was little I was touched by a girl in my school and she kept doing it even after I said no. Although I told my close friends what happened they told me I was a loser and that I should have liked it. Sometimes when I go to sleep at night I can still hear there voices telling me I am a loser and my recent relationship did not help. During the relationship I felt like I was more of a therapist than I was her boyfriend and she dumped all of her problems and issues on to me and expected me to be able to make her feel better every time. This made me feel horrible about myself because anytime I did not make her feel better we would have an argument and then he would say she was wrong and apologize. We have had more than 60 arguments over our 6 month relationship. And anytime I would ask my friends if I should break up with her they would say no. But during my last two weeks of school my parents told me I could not call anyone or play games so my grades would stay up. The same friends that told me not to break up with her told her to break up with me for not talking to her. I broke up with her because she wants me to give her 6 hours a day and anytime I ask for time to myself she would see upset. I hate myself right now and I do not know why. I have cut myself multiple times and have to pretend like everything is ok when in reality I am 5 seconds away from breaking down.

"hi all,i want to start by saying i have a good support system at the moment and am utilizing all of my resources to push through this. but I have made an observation about myself and my thoughts recently. lately i have not been drinking much. and that is good. but when i do, i indulge. subsequently, i feel painfully depressed for DAYS after. the physical symptoms of my hangovers are bad, but the mental symptoms are much, much worse. i struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts when sober, but have a regimented self care method to manage it. and i manage quite well. so the spiral i feel after one single night of drinking is distressing.i know alcohol is a depressant, and i know that it does not particularly make anyone feel good. but i was wondering if anyone else feels this way after a night of drinking, where you cannot shake suicidal thoughts and feelings for up to a week. my friends are normal in that they obviously feel shitty the day after drinking, but not for multiple days. so I am feeling alone. evidently the solution is to probably stop drinking altogether, but i just wanted to see if anyone else has felt such intensity from a single night of drinking, and if anyone has any advice. from alcohol, to sex, to social media consumption: normal human experiences never feel normal. i either feel things too intensely, or i feel completely numb. i just want to be able to enjoy things normally, and to react to setbacks (like hangovers) in a perceivably normal way. but i cannot. but I am going to keep trying.thank you i just need a place to talk about this","Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help",Medium

"Hey, i have made some progress mentally since I started taking antidepressants but somehow I still cannot get over this issue, not with pills, not with therapy. Wherever I am, alone or with friends i constantly feel like the ugliest person in the room, i admit I might not be what society considers pretty but I just think this is too much, it does not make sense that I hate how I look so much and i know it is not good for my mental health but I cannot avoid it. I just always feel like I am the ugliest, sometimes I think I should not be allowed to go out and I feel bad for the people that have to see me because I am so ugly.

"Without going into detail, this diagnosis explains so much. The sudden break ups, severe mood swings, destructive and controlling behaviour - all makes a lot more sense now.
 We have been on and off for the past 7 months since we broke up, but recently we’ve been on and it’s genuinely felt like we’re rebuilding a meaningful connection again.
 She came to me straight away after her psychology appointment to talk to me about it, and what it could mean for us in the future. She shared her insecurities and concerns about it, but also what she knows she can build on within her self moving forward. She told me with confidence that she is willing to give our relationship a good shot again, and I am too.
 Being aware of her diagnosis, we can work together and with help of her psychologist it looks like she’s getting back on track again - and I’m willing to support her through all of this.
 She’s asked me not to tell anyone about this at least until she’s ready, so that’s why I’ve come here to update this subreddit.
 Anyone willing to share any experiences or give any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",Seeking Help,Medium
"I grew up mostly dating men but realized when I was a teenager that I also like women. I know for sure that I am attracted to women, but I go off and on with feeling or knowing if I like men. Do I dislike my male ex’s because they did me wrong or because I forced myself to date men through compulsory heterosexuality?
 A few years ago I did believe that I was a lesbian, then went back to bisexual a year later. Now I feel like I am a lesbian again but honestly I really am not sure.
 I label myself as queer now because I don’t know if I truly fit into the bisexual category or lesbian category.

"Hello fellow friends 😄
 
 I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.
 
 There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?
 
 For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 
 
 I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:
 
 ""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""
 
 To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""

 Been out of the dating scene for two years after a string of awful relationships. Me and this girl have talked as friends everyday for 6 months been dating for 3, and it’s great overall I love her very much. 
 
 With the new relationship ive found myself creeping into old thought patterns and codependency. I’ve never been to a psychiatrist or anything, just been obsessed with personal development since I was 14. It’s hard to deal with because logically she has done nothing to trigger these emotions.
 
 I thought I had these aspects of myself dealt with and released but there’s still more. I find myself worrying about every little change in energy or if she will just get bored and leave me. I feel as if I never do enough when I give my absolute all. It’s very confusing and I struggle on my end to not resent myself.
 
 I can’t afford going to therapy or anything but, I’m just wondering if anybody feels the same or has any advice.

"Two days ago I posted something so cute about hitting 76 days clean and now I’m all fucked up. Idk what happened but my bf (LDR) said that he wanted to shorten my trip length from a week to just a weekend. This changed comes after about a week of him acting really weird, he says he’s got a concussion but he worked and drank too much making it worse. I was ok with that but I wish he told me before when he was acting weird so I knew. 
 
 He wasn’t talking to me or texting me as much as he used to saying he needs to minimize phone time or he just doesn’t use his phone when he’s out or with fam or friends but he’s with them 24/7!! The phone is literally how we communicate and how this relationship works!! I felt abandoned like he just didn’t care bc he refused to compromise, we went from talking ~1-2 hr on the phone each day and like 500???? texts to like ~30 min on the phone and 100 texts a day. 
 
 I really hurt. I felt alone. He has so much time with his friends and family in person and I don’t ever get to see him, and he still wants to shorten our trip that is literally still a week and a half away bc of his concussion when he literally does the same stuff we’d be doing maybe even more when I came up. He says he needs to feel independent but I’m literally 1000 miles away and am just ducking asking for 8% of ur time every day. 
 
 He knew I had BPD from the start but I have genuinely been able to control it better than ever before until tonight. I just feel like he’s making excuses to not talk to me and not let me come up anymore, but why? You know what my mind jumps to… I believe him when he says he had a concussion but I really just feel like he changed into a different person. He went from being the perfect person everyone loved him promising me everything caring and understanding and now he acts like I’m fucking disgusting and he hates me. 
 
 Tonight he promised me that I would have a chance to call and talk to him for a while, but then he called late and said he was tired and needed to go to sleep to rest up instead but then I texted him a little later and he texted back and he had just been chilling with his brother who he sees CONSTANTLY. And then called his friend instead of talking to me after promising me!! He always sees and talks to these people he lives so close to them! He literally just acts like he fucking hates me and I’ve kept it together for a fucking week and a half and I really just wanted to fuckinf see him for enough time.

"Is it overcompensating because you feel unworthy, so you need to give others an added value, because you aren't one ?
 Is it you picking narcissistic people so that they feed of you, since it's familiar?
 Is it out of kindness and empathy?
 Is it out of guilt?
 Were you trying to save yourself through them?
 Why the self sacrifice?
 Why doing so and not being at all happy about it, even angry at yourself?
 Why those people disappear once you stuck on their side when they were in distress? Or was it you pushing them away, because you feel that now that you aren't needed you will be discarded? Or them changing their attitude? Are you the jerk at the end ? Or is it them ?
 And why does it feel good, so good when you weren't the one that messed it up, after asking most of the people you know, if you did? And why can't you get over it, ever, when you did?
 
 I've never had a ""sure"" answer for those questions, I don't trust my judgement, and maybe I'm just victimising myself, or maybe I'm not.

 i just found out about bpd from dr daniel fox on youtube (lmao) and went on a binge, and damn, so many things i KNOW i underplayed on this test were brought up in some of these vids.

"A couple of years ago, prior to being diagnosed-- I impulsively cheated on my husband. I still take accountability in my wrong doings even though I know it was a very manic, triggered impulse state in my borderline recovery. Since then, I've worked to change my life around completely. I work now, have created a life and goals for myself, and pay for therapy sessions out of pocket (bc my insurance doesn't work with this therapist and she's been integral in my recovery) and really DO the work daily to not let borderline rule me or my impulses anymore. I still feel them-- especially as I was taught from early ages to equate self worth with sexuality etc, but I work hard daily to be better. 
 
 I confessed everything to my husband a year and a half ago, and my marriage has really changed for the better. Before where we had no connection, we have finally been best friends now the last while. Each other's cheerleaders.

 And let me just say, these magic little tic tacs have made a world of difference for me, when combined with therapy and my antidepressant. A year ago, my romantic relationship was particularly triggering, and I was prone to episodes of rage and self harm. I felt horribly inadequate, alien and at a constant risk of being abandoned.
 
 Nowadays, my moods are steadier, without any sense of being ""zombified.""

My self perception is also a lot more rational- I still see my faults, but they don't seem world-ending, anymore. The people around me seem more accepting, trustworthy and empathetic. 
 
 Even if they're not prescribed Abilify, I highly recommend that anyone who is feeling ""stuck"" in their current treatment speaks to their psychiatrist about treatment options. I had to specifically ask about them, months after my diagnosis, to start the conversation.

 TLDR at bottom with quotes from article.

 I can’t sleep, so I’ve been laying in bed contemplating my mental health and doing cell phone research. Anyway, came across this article that was REALLY interesting to me.
 
 I’ve never been tested for autism, but I’ve suspected most my life, never tested because parents didn’t see it and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then several years later the diagnosis was corrected to bpd, and I just put it off as okay bpd has similar things that’s all it is.
 
 However, my wife and I both have bpd and we’ve been comparing thought processes and talking about mental health a lot lately. And while we’re similar, we differ in a lot of ways. There’s a huge part of my behavior she still can’t understand when it comes to understanding what’s appropriate in certain interactions or in the often completely different ways I interpret situations. It brought me back to thinking maybe it is something more than JUST bpd, so yeah… the googling.
 
 I put the article at the top and I’ll put it [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590952/#!po=1.02041) as well.
 
 
 Basically I’m not crazy… 
 
 TLDR: I’ll sum it up with some quotes from the study:
 
 “…some females with BPD have undiagnosed ASC, due to ASC not being easily detected in females.”
 
 “Recent research is focusing on the possible under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis of ASC in females [40,41], on the assumption that females may experience greater societal pressure to conform and be part of a peer group and so are more motivated to learn how to hide their autism (so-called “camouflaging”) and thereby go “under the radar” of clinicians or school psychologists, by “pretending to be normal” [42]. This may lead to them either receiving their ASC diagnosis far later than males, and/or being diagnosed with other conditions (anorexia, depression, anxiety, or BPD) because clinicians are not looking for how ASC may present itself differently in females.”
 
 “…found that 6 out of 41 BPD patients fulfilled criteria for ASC.”
 
 “Our findings highlight the need for careful examination for autistic traits in patients referred for an assessment for BPD, especially in those without a history of significant childhood abuse or neglect. Some of these patients may have been misdiagnosed (their ASC was overlooked), and a proportion of them may have both conditions.”
 
 
 To put it short….
 
 Def going to talk to my psych MD about if I can be tested for autism now. Holy crap this article made every thing about me make so much more sense! Now I’m wide awake too! I mean, last thing I need is ANOTHER diagnosis to add to the pile, but if it helps it helps! So much for research articles putting people to sleep.""",Positive Coping,Low

"it's very difficult to figure out cuz there's a lot that's going on rn in my life that might have caused this. basically i had a great past week or so, but i think since Wednesday ish i just feel like shit. i can't force myself to do anything, the smallest inconvenience makes me want to scream, i don't want to talk to my parents and after im done with work i just eat and work on my stupid ""passion projects"" until i pass out at 2 am. funny thing is I'm not depressed perse, like im not sad over anything i just feel empty and weak. there are a couple possible reasons for this. might be withdrawal from Adderall (long story), might be just the fact that my job in customer service is finally taking its tole on me, might be an argument i had with my dad, I'm not really sure. whatever it is it's a shitty feeling. if any of u have had bipolar, I'd like to ask u if ur mood swings are triggered by something or are they just random?",Miscellaneous,Low
"I have no idea what is happening to me, but what I'm feeling is absolute emptiness, and despair. I'm numb to everything I think. I hope this feeling ends soon, I've been this way for the past week, it's felt like years though and it's horrific. I'm so tired... So tired. I need a break. I want to sleep and have good dreams. I want to sit still and feel peace. I want to let go of the white hot emotions inside of me. I try and try to let go and to soothe myself, but to no avail. Time after time, the cycle repeats, and I end up in the same place. I don't know why I expect things to be different sometimes. Hope seems so stupid right now. I'm trying to have it, though. I'm so lonely. And being with people makes it worse. Even those who I think I care for.

"Hi there, I am a 23 y/o girl with a single mother who is presumed to have bpd or c-ptsd (suspected by my counsellor). I love her a lot but I just find it endlessly difficult to get along with her as she is very intense. We argue a lot, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I do hate that one silly argument can result in a week long silent treatment/ resentment in my mother. This period kills me as I love to sort things out soon (no later than a day), say our apologies and move on. After every argument she’ll say something along the lines of “it’s not like we have a good relationship” “I will get back to you to set up new boundaries for our new relationship..” or she’ll threaten to never talk to me again and accuses me of causing her lots of pain. This is why I moved out.
 
 Ive notices that she copies a lot of the things I do and that she is finding herself at the same time I am. There’s nothing wrong with that but it makes me feel icky. She copies the shoes I wear, wants to travel when I do, wants to suddenly move to another area when I’m moving out of home (when she’s never had any of those thoughts growing up). It feels like she sees what I’m doing and compares it to herself. If I wear new pants she says “where are they from? How much? Why don’t I buy myself things like you do?”. I got annoyed the other day when she wanted me to get her the same shoes I wear so I said “mum you have your own identity I’m sure there are lots of other shoes you’d like” and it offended her. She tried to clear this with me on Easter, I apologised and she stopped talking to me and it was awkward as hell. Shes used the line “I’m going to establish new boundaries for our relationship [implying less connection etc”. I know I shouldn’t have questioned her identity but I wish I had a mum who had her own taste and timeline. She’s 53. I hate that she holds resentment for so long. It’s awfully tiring and I can’t sleep. Me and my bf can sort issues out more efficiently and it’s so much healthy.

"47 y/o male. Divorced. In stable relationship now - finally. 
 
 While visiting my parents this weekend, I opened a box which contained painful memories. One was so many letters and cute things from my courtship with my ex-wife and mother of my child. I’ve been able to come to a place where I don’t fully blame myself for the end of my marriage. I get that it was both of us, only I did the acting out. Of course.
 
 What is more painful tonight is that my mom kept every letter my college ex girlfriend wrote me. Reading back, it’s so easy to see the pure love she had that was so hard to see then. She was also the one who took the most emotional abuse, when I was at worst and had absolutely zero self-awareness. All these letters and pics showed a genuinely good person who did not deserve any of what I subjected her to, and that is difficult.
 
 It’s been over 20 years. I since had a 14 year marriage which ended, have a ten year-old son, fell hard, and have gotten up. I have my pain, but I now manage myself better than ever. I have a partner of three years I treat well. I just feel for this woman who so clearly loved me, but got the worst of me, tonight.
 
 We last had contact in about 2005 or 2006. It was still loving and caring, inquiring about each other’s friends and families. I know she has three kids and a good life.I tried an FB message about eight years go which was never read - no assumptions made. I want to say how sorry I am. She loved me so goddamn much, but I also don’t see the use. The right thing is to cherish what I have and not repeat this a third time in my life.","Progress Update, Mood Tracking",Medium

 I also feel ashamed that I’m in my 30’s and I get mad at my sister for not getting back to me in a timely manner. This has been going on for YEARS though. The thing is, my brain decided a long time ago that I don’t even want to talk to her, but I try to because I feel bad for her. I want her to know she still has family. I’m here. But I don’t want to be here. And the weird times she does text me, I really don’t even want to talk to her. Not even because of the texting thing, but just because I don’t care about her being in my life.

"My (24f) girlfriend and I (27m) recently having been doing some research and talking about how she shows a number of signs of BPD. Thanks to Dr Keith Gaynor's brilliant lecture on BPD we're pretty sure it was her car accident a few years ago that was the traumatic stress trigger that caused her BPD to spiral and it's been very up and down ever since. As you all probably know having this condition, the lows and highs can occur from hour to hour and day to day, and she's in a pretty good spot today and hoping it lasts through the week. 
 
 What makes this most difficult for me is that I don't really know when she's flipped the switch to crisis mode. I can't live my life constantly on the look out for it right now, and any time i'm not fully prepared myself to deal with it, it spirals into a fight between us and that fight almost ruins a whole day for us. Stress about her current job situation means this could be a tumultuous week, and she's also in classes at night. 
 
 We've agreed that the only true solution is finding the right clinician and getting the help she needs, DBT seems promising! But at the end of the day, we're still really new learning about this condition, community, lifestyle whatever you want to call it. As someone who suffers with severe ADHD, from my own experience I felt like it actually got worse when I started learning about it more, it's like your brain can't help but exhibit the symptom you just learned your condition has a tendency to cause. Thankfully I'm in a place where I can support her with her work or class projects if she needs me to when she can't cope, and she's been returning the favor and helping me with my own scatter brain and forgetfulness. We're an amazing couple 80% of the time, and a hot mess 20%.
 
 She won't be able to get professional help at least for another month or so. And I'm truly worried about her and I want to do everything I can to help her navigate her life until then. This weekend was really really rough but tonight she seems to be getting to a better place, so please any tips or things to watch out for to help her not feel in the middle of a crisis every day!

"I was talking to my bf about (funnily enough) BPD traits that I’d learned the explanations of on Tiktok. I was giving an example of one (about tying yourself too much to your actions, so that when someone asks you to do something, like, “Do you mind putting your cup somewhere else next time?,” you get oddly angry and defensive because it feels like they attacked you personally), and I gave an example of my own. I guess it was too pointed with the tone I used, because my bf accused me of having a specific time in mind that involved him, and became on edge and told me I was getting triggered and needed to take medicine. No matter how many times I told him that I didn’t have a specific instance in mind and that I didn’t mean to sound so pointed, I don’t think he believed me. He just wanted me to hurry up and go have some space so I wouldn’t freak out. 
 
 And it’s like WHY does it have to be that I’m attacking him when I am not?? I’ve had a lot of trouble with it before, and can still struggle now, but I’m trying to be BETTER. Even when I notice I’m getting triggered, I’ll sometimes try to diffuse my emotions/distract myself by showing my bf a funny video I found on tiktok. And does it matter? Of course not! All that matters was that I got triggered in the first place, and that’s a point against me. 
 
 Why does it feel like people WANT me to be the fucking problem sometimes? I swear, I’m trying to get better, but it doesn’t matter to anyone! They’re used to me having a problematic role, and that’s just where I’m supposed to stay. 
 
 If I get triggered, I’m a toxic lunatic. If I tell people that I was able to cope better and not freak out this time, it’s a little “good job,” and then forgetting it ever happened. And that happens with EVERYTHING, not just my BPD. 
 
 I’m largely seen as lazy and irresponsible, and it’s TRUE. I’m a waste of space! But, when I finally accomplish a tiny step forward, it’s fine, but not a big deal, because I should’ve been doing that already.
 
 Why do ANYTHING, then?? Myself and the people around me have gotten too used to how awful I am. We’re all too comfortable. But, I really wanna feel/do better and FEEL SEEN.","Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Causes of Distress",Medium

"Hi, this is may be deleted at one point but I’m not sure when
 
 I am not yet diagnosed with borderline but I’m almost 100% I have it. And it’s killing me. It has been killing me all my life. It has affected my friends, my loved ones and myself. But you probably already know that
 
 What’s concerning me right now, is whether or not I can feel love. Right now, my girlfriend and I are on a one week break from one another. I’ve been what I fee is an emotionally abusive asshole towards her. Paranoid that she would cheat on me, that she would leave me. And before that, ever little thing I didn’t like that she did, set me off. When it shouldn’t have, and I know it shouldn’t have. But it did anyways. And it always hurt me later to think about it.
 
 My question is: can borderlines feel love? I feel like I’ve been such a manipulative piece of crap to her, and I just want to know if there’s even any hope. I don’t want to hurt her heart, she means so much to me but I’ve been such a douche to her. I stared self reflecting so much, asking why I even love her. If I even do. I cried so much thinking about her gone. The thought of not seeing her. Her smile gone, her heart to someone else. She can do as she pleases but it hurts me. Do I love what she’s done for me, or her as a person? How can I even tell? Is she better off without me? Can I fix us? Maybe I’m overthinking..

"CW: alcohol, sex, self harm 
 
 I’ve been binge drinking since I was 15. That’s just what you do here as a young person. Right away I think I didn’t have a good relationship with it. Back in highschool I used to drink to numb the pain. But I started noticing patterns like I probably had sex 99% of the time I binged. 
 
 I’ve been through the whole shebang with drinking. Fighting with friends and family, running away from home, unprotected sex, online shopping and dropping cash without a second thought. Trying drugs without second thought. Missing events and work. Cutting when I’ve been clean for months. I once shredded my legs to pieces at my own house party because someone hurt my feelings.
 
 When I drink, all the darkest parts of me come out. My inhibition is insane. It’s like my BPD is just sitting there waiting tor me to drink. I never pass out, I want to keep going. I become a huge fucking people pleaser. I know an issue of mine is I want everyone to like me. I want everyone to think I’m cool and awesome and the best. When I drink I will do anything to seem “chill”. Often this involves acting out of character. I will over share to death. I’ll get flirty just to try to seem desirable.
 
 I’m 23 now and in most aspects of my life I’m thriving. I have a healthy relationship, an apartment. Nearing the end of a bachelors degree. I want so badly to be a good person. I think I am a good person, I just have this fucking demon. The anxiety I have after a night of drinking is insane. It can last weeks. My boyfriend is extremely kind and understanding but that doesn’t stop my guilt. I wouldn’t want to be him. This part of me makes me feel unlovable. And I don’t want something to happen I can’t come back from. And i’m so tired of this anxiety. It makes me want to end my shit more than my bpd. 
 
 I’ve had therapists want me to go to AA and it’s just pissed me off. I always think I’m so young or it’s not like I’m drunk all the time. But now my psychiatrist wants me to go. And I’m breaking. I’m wearing myself down.","Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping",High
"So this is my first Reddit post. Whatever that means, I’m just lost and really seeking help. I don’t want to end up like another BPD story where the love of their life walks out. 
 
 I lied to my partner Thursday, I believe I had a BPD episode and he doesn’t. Even if he doesn’t, it’s my fault, I’m no longer taking my meds or going to therapy. 
 
 On Thursday I made up a lie. About my partner’s ex whom he keeps in contact with (but we both keep in contact with our exs- nbd) I said a lot of crazy shit— I received a “text” message from someone who knows her and said they (his ex and him) would ultimately be together in the end, that he is using me, that he wants to be with her, and that he is deleting messages between them to because I have gone through his phone in the past, that I was crazy.
 
 I don’t know why I lied to that extreme, I just know that it was fucked up which is why I’m seeking accountability. 
 
 What does accountability look like for someone with BPD, I know I lied, I know I’m not on my meds I know I am not going to therapy. 
 
 When he confronted me about the lie on Friday I realized I had spilt it was all black and white thinking in my head. He loved and missed his ex and hated and wanted nothing todo with me. As I’m writing this I realize it isn’t the reality of things but I still acted out. And I need to be held accountable for my actions. I don’t want to lose the love of my life. 
 
 After he left the apartment to clear his head I began to cut because I needed to release all my emotions and built up anxiety. As I was looking at the blood fall I knew I had to seek help I didn’t want this to be the last feeling I felt. 
 
 I have my psychiatrist appointment the 19th at 10:30 am — wish me luck 🍀.

"So, a little background. I'm a 23 year old male with a BS in physics and applied math. So I'm somewhat intelligent (this is relevant). About a month ago, I saw an article on reddit (can't remember the sub) about a doctor who was helping people with an issue that seemed similar to what I'm experiencing. The best way that I can describe it with how the article described it, is that you come to a conclusion on something that *could* happen (or start thinking about *why* something happened in the past the way it did), and you basically go on a logic train to hell, where you follow a bunch of illogical conclusions that build up into a horribly unrealistic scenario. However, if someone asks about how you got to the scenario, they can see your logic that brought you to that last conclusion because they can follow your logic even though the logic is unrealistic. The problem is I can't for the life of me think of what the disease is called.
 
 On the topic of the intelligence part, the article talked about the doctor having to use techniques for this one patient because he was intelligent and the normal treatment wouldn't really work with him. Basically he could see past simple logic problems, but not advanced ones. I think this is where I'm at right now.

At first, I just accepted it, but then he just won't shut up about them. Not just with me, but with complete strangers. It was like he viewed it as some sort of badge.

 You'd think having a mental disorder is a private matter. My mother had depression for my whole life and I never knew until I found the depression pills she hides.
 
 Anyways, this isn't about my friend really. I'm giving him the support he needs (even though it embarrasses me every time he brags about them). Instead, this is about factitious disorder and you. Do you have real mental diseases or factitious disorder? Read all about it below:

This is common with this medication, but the doctor's advice to reduce dosage only works occasionally, but not enough to be helpful.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. As long as I've known him, he's had slight schizophrenic episodes... They come in waves. He will become horribly depressed and tell me he hears voices in his head coaxing him to kill himself or hurt himself, and while he isn't necessarily inclined to do it, they are loud and persistent... In addition, he says he will often remember a phrase he heard earlier in the day and repeat it in his head for hours on end. He says he sees black shadows in the corners of his eyes and when the lights are off, he will see them in plain view. These episodes are accompanied by insomnia. I also found out a year ago that he is bisexual- I am as well (I'm female, to put it in perspective)- and I now understand that with these episodes, he will go from the very straight side of the spectrum directly to the other side, telling me that girls begin to repulse him and that he loses feelings for me. All this occurs about once a month and subsides after four or five days, after which he goes entirely back to normal. This may be a far stretch, but I feel all these things are connected... We checked, and his family does not have a history of mental illness. If I didn't mention this already, he is twenty years old, which I know is when mental illness can pique. I don't expect anyone to be able to fix him but I'd like to know what is going on with him and if it's been seen before. He refuses to go see a therapist so this is all I've got.

"Ok I'm a 22 year old guy. In 2014 I began to improve my diet. I just stopped eating junkfood, sugar, no sodas, and just water and 3 solid meals a day. Eventually a few weeks after that I felt like a god like I woke up for the first time. Before this my mood was worse and so was my diet. Anyway my libido was never better, I lost fat, physical strength seemed to increase, mood very balanced and energy was great! I wasn't even workingout then. Even on days were I didn't sleep to good I still felt phenomenal. I enjoyed doing things in the yard and my irritablility was nonexistent, but occasionlly I'd eat sugar, or drink a beer here and there but thats it. This lasted to about thanksgiving last year. I lost selfcontrol and fell a slave to the holiday foods. Especially Christmas. So yeah I picked up pounds and my libido decreased and my energy but my mood was decent still. This last till about early March this year. So last month I cleaned my diet up or tried to. Heres the thing, I just got a job in March and pretty much I leave early in the morning and come back late at night, and I have to repeat next morning. I wasn't able eat too much. I still ate 3 times a day but I didnt have time to eat a large amount. Ever since then, my mood has shot down, my libido has gone down, now I'm irrationally angry and depressed for no reason! Homicidal thoughts and occasionally suicidal. Like I wanted to drive this lady of the road this morning for cutting me off and flipping me off and I didn't even care she had a kid with her, but luckily I maintained control and I got over it quickly. My mood bounces like crazy, I can be happy talking with a friend and then after they leave hours later, I'm depressed, then I'm wanting to kill someone, then I see something funny or distracting that puts me in a temporarily good mood. I already had an episode of me yelling outside earlier because I didn't want to break anything in my home. Last week I wanted to attack some guy just from snoring on the bus, this is a new type of anger for me. My muscle mass has decreased, I feel a bit weaker, somedays or moments I feel lethargic, hating life and fatigue others I don't, even if I sleep good I'll still feel tired even if I wake up with a good mood. I do notice I get a temporary mood boost while and after I'm eating but feel fatigued sometime after. I was thinking maybe I wasn't eating enough because I know restricting calories can cause a few issues. I changed jobs, now I'm working with my uncle who has a much better work schedule. I'm putting a bit more food on my plate thinking I'd go back to my old self, but no help at all. I don't know if I'm still not eating enough, I did increase the amount of food though. I'm not sure if this is a mental issue or a nutritional one. I'm not going through anything that would cause me to be this angry for no reason. Nothing in my life has changed except my eating habit which I'm fixing. I'm sleeping way better, and again no junk or sugar. Even years ago when I ate like crap, I never experienced this. If this not a lack of calorie issue, then WHY now? Why all of a sudden do I feel a drop in everything, I mean back in 2014 I fixed my diet felt fantastic, I get a little loose with it, try to fix it again now this is happening. I'm confused. From what I remember, I don't think I'm eating much less than I was last year, also I'm less social, like I'd rather stay in than hangout. I never was a huge social person but I still enjoyed the occasional outing. Sorry if this is long, again I'm just extremely lost here and confused as to what the source of this could be. Could being overweight cause this?? I've been obese before and it's not a thing new to me. Thanks.",Miscellaneous,Low

"Howdy! I have not posted in this subreddit before so I hope my post meets the submission guidelines. 
 
 I am interested in the topic of mental illness and criminality. Today I read an article about an alleged terrorist who had been under surveillance by the FBI for an extended period. During this time, undercovers posed as love interests and terrorist sympathizers to coax a man who they identified as mentally ill into committing crimes.

 I do not defend the actions of people who willfully commit acts of violence, but it seems morally and ethically unsound to identify someone as mentally ill then coax them into criminal acts, especially involving terrorism.

"I started seeing my pdoc in fall of 2012. Around this time, I went into the hospital for suicidal ideation. Little medication change, things were pretty good until spring of 2014. I relapsed hard, purging, cutting, not going to classes. 
 My therapist asked me to start coming in 2x a week, which didn't help and just cost me a ton of money. My pdoc upped me to the maximum dosage of my antidepressant. This really messed me up and I completely broke down and had to go home for the semester.
 I returned last fall, feeling much better after seeing a good therapist in my hometown and switching medications. I was doing pretty well. 
 But for the past month or so, I've been having symptoms that I've never really had before. I can hardly sleep, I can't focus (it takes me forever to read a news article) and I just feel anxious and overstimulated all the time. 
 I saw my pdoc this morning for a regular appointment, but made some of this new stuff clear on my intake sheet. He brushed it all off as stress (I'm working about 25 hours a week this semester.) 
 I feel like saying more would be pushy. I just think that after three years, he's not going to be open to looking into yet another diagnosis. It feels so stagnant. Our appointments are 10 minutes, tops.

"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I will try keep this short and to the point.
 
 I am part of a friendship group. We've been close friends since middle school and are now in our late 20s.
 
 Amongst this group is L. I have known L since I was about 6. I used to love going to his house on play dates because there were no sense of rules. He's from an incredibly wealthy family who never spent much time supervising him. Play dates at L meant no bedtime, do whatever you want, buy whatever you want, reality did not exist there.
 
 L grew up without ever needing a cent - he was and has always been very generous about spending on his friends, sharing the hedonism, etc. He spent most of his 20s bouncing between various colleges but not completing any courses. He managed to receive a diploma in video game development.
 
 In his early 20s he began to develop this misogyny that has just gotten worse. He is an overt (who thinks he's subtle) pickup artist. He will bounce between his ""tinder boos"", hanging onto them until he's fucked them and then dump them and move on. His father was the same and it's surprising that he does not realize the implications of that kind of behavior.
 
 To get a girl in bed he will use every trick outlined in The Game as well as more insidious techniques. He will tell them they're the one and he loves them. He'll be fucking other girls on the side until he beds his latest conquest, then she gets thrown into the gutter.
 
 This bothers all of us in the group, we don't agree with that kind of misogyny. We give him shit for it, we know it's not right, but he's always been good to us. He's funny to be around. His warped sense of reality can be hilarious.
 
 But now here's the kicker.
 
 L has started working at my company. He's been there for less than a month while I've been there for two years.
 
 These traits of his are coming out very negatively now. He is trying to seduce every girl in the office. He is subtly undermining my authority in the office in front of woman.
 
 At a staff function on Friday (which I left early) he got incredibly wasted, hooked up with a girl from the office (at the same time, cheating on his girlfriend who he was taking out for a Valentine's day lunch the next day), lied to my boss about taking the taxi she ordered for him home and drove himself without bothering to inform any of his friends.
 
 We spent all night stressing and panicking because he was supposed to meet up with us an hour earlier and was unreachable. We drove around the city trying to retrace his steps before finding out he just went home.
 
 I've been paying more attention to his behaviour in the office. He is telling outright lies to people, his intonation changes when he speaks to females - he is simply a different person than the one that we chill with out of work and it's actually become very worrying. When I try call out his bullshit in front of other people, he will either totally ignore it or he reverts to some PUA technique he's memorized about handling conflict.
 
 Last night, another friend of mine asked me some yes or no questions related to L's attitude towards woman, and his attitude in general. I answered yes to every question. Turns out it was an ASPD checklist.
 
 I'm incredibly concerned now. I've never really known what a sociopath was but I think I'm dealing with one now.

 I'm tired of crying all the fucking time at nothing because no matter how hard I try or how well I do, I can never feel GOOD for an ongoing period of time.
 
 I'm tired of having ugly ass arms because I was raped and sexually assaulted multiple times and didn't know how else to handle it other than by taking a blade to my arms every night hoping that maybe I went deep enough this time.
 
 I'm doing things without even knowing that I'm fucking doing them.
