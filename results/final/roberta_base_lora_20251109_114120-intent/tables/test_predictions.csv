The only reason I have not killed myself is because I don t want to be selfish but I really want to do it For the past years I ve wanted to kill myself but I don t want to hurt the lives of others I know that if I killed myself I have friends and family that would be very upset and would wonder if there was anything they could have done to stop it So I guess it s good that I recognize that I have made some impact on others but that s not the issue here I just don t want to live I don t like life I know that if I were more optimistic I could maybe have a better life but I ve tried being optimistic and that doesn t work out either because I always end up disappointed I ve gotten to the point where I m just faking life I do what I need to do to fit in I know it s been five years ish since I ve felt this way but I m wondering if there will ever be a point that I just say screw it and do it I also attempted once about years ago when I first started having these thoughts and one of my close friends no longer close helped me out and stopped me from completing my already started actions So yeah I realize that other people would be disappointed But I want to do things for myself Well I guess by that I mean that I want to do this one thing for myself I hope that was coherent Your thoughts reactions would be appreciated,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking"

"chronic pains from chronic anxiety for the past few months iâ€™ve been dealing with chronic pain that seems to move around my body primarily in my feetâ€”especially the heelsâ€”and deep buttocks pain that feels like its within the bones they sometimes switch almost never at the same time 
 
 iâ€™ve undergone numerous doctor visits countless blood tests and several scans yet everything seems to check out okay healthwise a physical therapist ruled out fibromyalgia but suggested that the pain might be linked to chronic stress and anxiety
 
 adding to this ive been grappling with intense fatigue not sleepiness sporadically which complicates things further
 
 this has been an incredibly challenging journey especially because the pain persists and impacts my daily life making it difficult to walk at times its become evident that its not just physical its linked to my mental health however i have dealt well with my anxiety and do not have almost any anxiety feelings or symptomts for months now if anything the pains started after my month long anxiety flare up
 
 iâ€™m curious if anyone here has experienced something similarâ€”chronic pain seemingly from chronic anxiety or stressâ€”and if so how did you cope did you find any strategies that helped alleviate the pain or manage it better over time how long did it take and where were the pains exactly in your body

Waking up in the middle of the night weighing up the pros and cons of people caring that I stay alive It s currently Monday morning AM I woke up about two hours ago still half drunk having had about hours sleep ate some more Xanax and smoked more weed I spent most of this weekend in my bed I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to I have a good support network which I m extremely grateful The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was or I m now M Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then In this time I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity This adds to my conflict Do I want to be here Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career During the pandemic and recession the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances I am one of these people I am very grateful for what has been provided to me but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job amp x B Right now I kind of just wish I hadn t woken up in the middle of the night I feel slightly better after crying and writing this but I suspect that this loneliness is about become quite overwhelming again when I finish writing Love of any kind seems to so rarely be a worthwhile investment Is it normal that most of the people who I have loved have either severely betrayed me left or died I know that I m the common link here I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I m mentally ill but how the fuck do I fix all this I couldn t deal with another loved one dying from drug alcohol overdose or suicide I can t count them on both hands anymore I know there are people in much worse positions but I can t talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone Today was a nice day why am I still like this It s almost am now I wonder if I ll be able to go back to sleep,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Pushed to the edge and trying to find hopeI haven t made a post like this before but have reached out in the past with career guidance and the such Right now I m not doing well and I m in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that won t scare and worry my friends and family I ve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last years of depression and anxiety now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis one month ago My post isn t a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around My now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night Now Some of my best friends got married this week where my ex was the maid of honor I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day many advise no on the friends with the ex especially in this situation but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner and just want my friendship that I have had with her to remain I don t have many friends left around me The night before their wedding I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didn t say much more than that My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi Polar disorder They don t understand it and Don t believe I am and think I m chasing something that doesn t exists The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to But I wasn t able to I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do And told her I don t think being friends will ever work I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding My friends and fraternity brothers All this is too much for me right now with the added fact I ve changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I don t find meaningful or fulfilling And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole I know now that it s a problem I need to work on I ve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little I don t know how they feel but I can imagine it hurts is frustrating and an annoyance they didn t need I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself That it would magnify the pain I m feeling and put it on to them I m just so unstable right now even on medication therapy and exercise I know I can reach out to my friends for support and don t want to burden them I m just so afraid and lonely right now I don t want to die but death is looking more and more favorable I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away To anyone that reads this thank you,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day",Critical Risk,"Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why","Cause of Distress, Seeking Help, Mental Distress","Positive Coping, Progress Update"

BF Constantly Threatening SuicideSo I m a little nervous about making this post because I don t really want to be found out but this is beyond my understanding anymore The man I have dated for a long time is a widely intelligent attractive man In the beginning it was pure magic We spent a lot of time together we went out on dates etc Then I moved to college and came back home It was toward the end of last year that this all began Out of nowhere he started threatening to hang himself because I was being negative While I ve always known to take threats seriously I kinda let it slide because maybe I pissed him off and didn t realize it He blames me for being negative and a drama queen and this is causing him to want to kill himself I know this isn t the full story I know there must be something else going on At the end of the day I am not responsible for his suicide I am not legally bound to him in any way Problems got worse when one day he came over and we were fighting about something stupid The fight rose to the point where he is screaming at me saying I am going to hurt you and me begging him not to touch me Eventually he grabbed me called me stupid among other things I cowered and threw my hands over my face attempting to shield myself thinking he was actually going to strike But he threw me aside I begged him to calm down and he wasn t being rational He finally agreed to relax but then started screaming again At this point he was thrown out for threatening me Fast forward Most days it is ok I don t hear from him much and try to give him space to work on his projects but these episodes of suicide can occur when I least expect it At times he told me he had a rope and made a noose out of it He tried it and caused harm to himself apparently I honestly believe that some of this is false The other day I fell asleep on him and he told me he still had the noose in his closet if I don t stop being negative The problem with all of this is that it is starting to affect my level of sanity If I don t hear from him for like half a day I immediately start thinking he has hurt himself I know you ll day get rid of him I am just wondering if there is a real way to diagnose the problem I wish I knew what to do,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

To whoever is thinking about suicide and sees this Even if it feels you are alone that no one understands you that you are so worthless to the point that the world is better off without you Just stop And think clearly about what you are doing There are many people that would be sad to see you go like that Even if you don t know that One of your family or friends pets some complet stranger that you accidentally smiled to and helped them relive their stress or even one of your fellow redditors that are kind enough to care about you I know i do Even though i never knew you Knowing that a human died when i could have stopped that with a few words of encouragement would surely bring me over my breaking point Well just make sure to think about everyone that would love to help you before you do anything you might not live to regret Please,Critical Risk,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking"

A NoteI ve dealt with depression for at least years now I tried everything I could on my own to feel better eating well working out good sleep schedule etc Nothing worked I was in a type of medical school for a year and dropped out because I hated everything so much I now switched to computer science I definitely enjoy it more and I was hoping things would get better for me but I m still so unhappy It took me years to finally ask for help and see a doctor as I didn t want to worry my parents about it But finally I did a few months ago I saw my doctor and started an anti depressant Lexapro I was so so hopeful that this would help me but unfortunately things only got worse and worse These past months have been the absolute worst months of my life I m failing classes because I missed so many lectures assignments I have no money no job I ve isolated myself so much I just feel like I can t do anything I now feel as if I ve exhausted almost all my options for help and I just don t know what I can do anymore I have no desire to be in this world anymore I feel like I m just not cut out for it and I m okay with that There s so many other people out there my life is so small and meaningless anyway so what s it matter It sadly doesn t seem like it s worth all the trouble anymore And so many people have depression nowadays it s so sad I just fucking hate it here The only thing keeping me around is the pain that I know I will cause my friends and family if I do end things I wish it were acceptable to just make the choice yourself to give up and leave Well if anyone actually read this thanks I ve been really wanting to tell someone close to me how I ve been feeling but I feel like I can t put all this weight on their shoulders And honestly I do believe things could get at least somewhat better if I kept trying But I don t think I even have the desire to do that anymore It doesn t seem worth it I just want out I feel like such a disappointment to everyone and I m so sorry to everyone I ve let down I feel so bad for being such a financial and emotional burden on my parents I m so sorry mom and dad I don t think I can take it much longer,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

It s my birthday in two weeksMobile Throwaway Longer than originally intended and while reading it back realised it sounds like a shit r storytime post so sorry for that I ve pretty much always felt sad for as long as I can remember Not all the time but if there were no distractions my default mood was sad Not necessarily crying my eyes out just low drained unmotivated to do anything I didn t tell anyone about how I felt because that was just normal to me Besides loads of people in their late teens early s say how depressed they are what s so special about me feeling down I worked in a pub for a year starting when I was As an antisocial introvert who finds his energy being away from people this was not a pleasant experience My girlfriend at the time was away at uni meaning between her lectures and my unsociable working hours we never got to see each other The weekend before my th birthday I worked clopens close the night open the morning in a row As I lay in bed after the final shift I felt so empty and alone and sad I accepted that this probably wasn t normal and that things needed to change I couldn t go on feeling sad all the time so I set myself an ultimatum By the time I turned I would be happy or I would be dead This seemed to relieve some of the pressure it gave me something to work towards as well as a finish line I knew it wouldn t go on forever Fast forward about and a half years I was still living at my parents house but I d left the pub and had a couple jobs in between At the time I was involved in stock management for a large national corporation which is to say I worked nights stacking shelves at a supermarket This was not my ambition I didn t really have an ambition but this wasn t it nor did I want to spend more time there than I really needed to so I was looking for other work as well I had applied for a particular job that seemed perfect for me flexible hours short commute ability to work from home if needed fast typing necessary v me on typeracer and find out all in all it felt like a good fit One day after a particularly unpleasant shift the night before I woke up to an email thanking me for my interest but that I was not going to be offered the job Not even an interview I didn t get the chance to show how well I would be able to work in the right environment All the factors that had made me so hopeful that I could get a proper job and do something that would bring me joy while earning a living at the same time gone discarded without a second look It wasn t fair But I didn t have the mental strength to deal with it there and then so I decided not to bother I went to get some dinner breakfast and was greeted by my mother usually very lovely asking all the wrong questions about money jobs my attitude just a lot of stuff that she has every right to be concerned about while I was living with my parents but absolutely the wrong time to ask I snapped at her we both said things we wish we hadn t I left and drove to a place where I could be alone and calm down After a while I went back home my parents were both very apologetic about the situation and I apologised as well I explained what had happened how I was feeling ALL of it and asked if they would help me get help I went to a GP and was diagnosed with clinical depression started on sertraline because who needs a sense of humour or sex drive to be happy Not only this but due to the length of the NHS waiting list my parents paid for me to see a private counsellor Therapy helped me talk and work through some things I d been struggling with for a while and was generally very beneficial I was able to realise that most of what was holding me back came from myself I didn t try new things or meet new people because I was worried that I wouldn t be good enough At least by not trying I d never know for certain maintaining the illusion of adequacy I so desperately needed These realisations came at a time where I ended a pretty nasty relationship came back from a session feeling very emotionally raw and was told the only way to feel better was to get a real job and to move in with her immediately and had secured an interview for a lucrative position with a clear path for progress Not only this but shortly afterwards I met someone else who is funny beautiful understanding and generally very lovely Life was good The antidepressants were stopped over the summer months and I made the decision to not carry on with them afterwards I moved out of my parents house and got a place with my new girlfriend And I got the job I had achieved everything I d wanted building a solid foundation from which the rest of my life could flourish But even now when all the distractions are put away and the world outside the window goes quiet I m still sad I lie less than a foot away from my loving girlfriend yet I m still alone I m years old and I m not happy It s my birthday in two weeks,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping,

"47 y/o male. Divorced. In stable relationship now - finally. 
 
 While visiting my parents this weekend, I opened a box which contained painful memories. One was so many letters and cute things from my courtship with my ex-wife and mother of my child. I’ve been able to come to a place where I don’t fully blame myself for the end of my marriage. I get that it was both of us, only I did the acting out. Of course.
 
 What is more painful tonight is that my mom kept every letter my college ex girlfriend wrote me. Reading back, it’s so easy to see the pure love she had that was so hard to see then. She was also the one who took the most emotional abuse, when I was at worst and had absolutely zero self-awareness. All these letters and pics showed a genuinely good person who did not deserve any of what I subjected her to, and that is difficult.
 
 It’s been over 20 years. I since had a 14 year marriage which ended, have a ten year-old son, fell hard, and have gotten up. I have my pain, but I now manage myself better than ever. I have a partner of three years I treat well. I just feel for this woman who so clearly loved me, but got the worst of me, tonight.
 
 We last had contact in about 2005 or 2006. It was still loving and caring, inquiring about each other’s friends and families. I know she has three kids and a good life.I tried an FB message about eight years go which was never read - no assumptions made. I want to say how sorry I am. She loved me so goddamn much, but I also don’t see the use. The right thing is to cherish what I have and not repeat this a third time in my life.","Mood Tracking, Progress Update",Positive Coping

"Hello fellow friends 😄
 
 I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.
 
 There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?
 
 For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 
 
 I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:
 
 ""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""
 
 To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""
 
 So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: ""There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it?

I m only years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long I m only only according to what people say years old and even though I wouldn t say I feel old exactly I m always thinking about our finite youth about ageing and our mortality I can t get it out of my head A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they re and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes as a year old with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes I m inevitably miserable in these pictures I see people I like admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises I m extremely scared of ageing you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me I m scared of regrets I m scared of ending up a nobody I m scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally I can t stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future I feel so much guilt when I m not efficient in what I m doing I feel so bad about myself my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty I hate myself for being too weak I really REALLY want this thing but I m so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can t pull through I want it so much that I want to cry It s more like a necessity than a mere desire The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating but having to do the work exhausts me emotionally I know at least one of the reasons why this happens meaning perhaps there are others but I m too embarrassed to tell anyone let alone publicly The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown with difficulty I partially told her my dream why I want it and why it s so important to me and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful It s not a crime or anything like that but it s something I feel is ridiculous and laughable something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am or have become One of my fears is having to commit suicide in the future between and years from now due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt I know I won t find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don t achieve my dream at least partially or if I don t achieve it in the time period I need to This is because my goal heavily depends on my age and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that My goal is along the lines of enjoy your young years doing things that years olds are Time itself is part of the specifications of my goal year olds or late year olds hanging out with early year olds is weird and unacceptable and I wouldn t feel part of the group either I want to hang out with year olds AS a year old but right now I can t I ve already wasted so much time isolating myself for years in my room with my computer not hanging out with people my age not gaining experiences not making memories but now what I want is something slightly different And being so ambitious or demanding sometimes makes me feel bad too Perhaps I m just a spoiled kid who hasn t grown up yet and learned of life Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable make peace with a life without this delusional grandeur dream of mine and live peacefully where I am I know progress can t be accelerated so much I do know it but I so wish it could you don t know much this pains me Life is so painful ageing is so painful your face changing and getting more year old looking is so painful I want to stay this age forever hang out with people my age all over the world celebrate with them suffer with them talk with them know of their dreams and fears learn about their subcultures be part of the group etc That last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want but yea as you see it s kind of stupid,"Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I can t tell anyone the real reason I m suicidal I was recently put in a psych ward for the suicidal because I was stupidly dropping major hints that I planned to kill my self in hopes that I could ask for help without destroying my pride When I was put in there my family blamed it on Prozac seeing as one of its side effects is suicidal thoughts I ve talked to therapist after therapist and I told them all the same thing But I haven t told anyone why I really wanted to kill myself Not even my closest friends The real reason I wanted to die was because of a girl I know it sounds stupid but hear me out I had known this girl for years and have had a HUGE crush on her from the second I was introduced to her Many years went by she had moved back and forth a few times When she came back this time I confessed my feelings for her She said the feelings were mutual but she wasn t ready for a relationship yet seeing as she had just gotten out of a bad relationship I made sure to let her know that I understood and planned to respect that About a month goes by and she is very flirty with me Touching me writing me little notes making fun of eachother sending me hearts etc However just when I think I m getting somewhere she gets back together with her ex They were all over eachother Their social media s filled with posts about eachother and going on and on about eachother The works Now not only was I fucked sideways in this situation but she still keeps me just close enough so that these feelings can t go away And she still does all the flirty things she did when she was single She is the only girl I ve ever had feelings this strong for I can t help but love her But after a month and a half of this It didn t sting as bad it just made me very depressed and sick I was starting to get over my suicidal feelings The psych ward really helped me realize a lot However all of those feelings rushed back after we hung out We grabbed a pizza watched a movie made eachother laugh and went for a walk in the autumn leaves She looked absolutely amazing She made me happy The entire time I was with her I didn t have a single worry Nothing else mattered It felt like I was in heaven It was then I realized how much I actually love her She told me she loved me but it felt so hollow as if it barely meant anything to her I just felt so empty knowing how disposable I am We talk often and she says she considers me her best friend I obviously play along but she means far more to me than any friend ever has We talk almost every day we hangout at least once a week and she still acts as flirty as she used to but I know it ll never go anywhere It s sad to say but I put all my eggs in one basket and somebody stole it I know I sound really pathetic but that s why I lied to everyone I m ashamed that she is the reason I wanted to end my life Don t get it wrong I have a life outside of her I have friends and family and hobbies and things to be proud of but it feels like none of that matters without her I m truly a piece of shit but I guess that s why I m saying this to strangers on the internet,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Considering it Hi all this is my first post I ve been having suicidal thoughts for some time now something that started like years ago I m about to turn and was diagnosed with GAD generalized anxiety disorder Lot s of things have happened in the last eight months as i graduated from med school i finished a five year relationship and tried to start another and my father had a stroke that left him with sequels i currently live with both of my parents This isn t easy for me to write as i feel not only as am a failure but that i m ashamed of myself I don t think i m worthy of anything of value and all effort is futile As my long term relationship was getting worse i got to meet a girl and started to hang out with her around the same time my father had the stroke Never did i cheat before as i was very loyal and had ethic above everything but something really happened and i did I felt awful after but couldn t stop seeing her Few months passed and we got to a point to decide what we should do I called it off as did nt wanted to hurt anybody two months later after finishing the long term relationship i called her and we met only to go out and have this weird date Long story short she s seeing somebody and mentioned that might be the biggest mistake of her life but i have to chose him and the relationship between us can t be for now After not seeing each other since then anymore we re contacting by mail at the moment i miss her ok so there s that My father is not getting better and also has depression so even though i m trying to help him recover nothing seems to work Most probably he won t never be the same I do have friends but i feel like they don t get me Im exercising almost everyday I also go to a psych and im on pregabalin for gad I play guitar and i m trying to record what i can I feel like im doing my best and it s not enough Honestly i don t know where to go o what to do I feel that i only have myself and that it is not enough I m thinking on stuff to do like a bucket list before i go i don t know anymore,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

TIL Nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously even your doctors and therapists Everybody thinks you re just being immature or finding excuses for your failures The only time they realise that you re really in trouble and need supports and helps is when it s all too late You might think the professionals would act totally different But the truth is that the therapist I met literally told me to grow up and be responsible and that the doctor I saw more or less implied he couldn t help and wouldn t care as long as it s my life not his child s I m trying to gather the courage to off myself within one or two days Don t want to live through a life I m incapable of living through while nobody cares at all,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Progress Update"

my parents yelled at me for self harming i ve been feeling empty since or really anxious i want to kill my self i don t want to do this shit anymore i m feeling so suicidal it was around days ago i took half a bar of xan i was hella loopy and shit and got really depressed the night before i made a pretty bad cut and i wanted to go deeper i stumbled for my box cutter and cut i reached fat i was bleeding a lot but i wasn t panicking i put gauze and wrapped it up rly tight i called my friend for around minutes and all i remember was saying i m gonna die over and over again i vividly remember his disappointed yet calm voice saying you re not going to die idk how but i hung up i don t remember much after but i know i took the other half and blacked out with no other memory of what happened i have videos of me on snap talking to myself saying shit like i don t have any real friends when i woke up my head was killing me and my cut was still bleeding w yellow shit coming out of it too i was really worried of infection the night before my dad saw my cut and just put triple anti biotic and medical tape on it so that s what i did for days i told some online friends and they were really worried especially my boyfriend they all were telling me to go to my parents and get stitches but i didn t have enough strength to the first day the days passed and i was getting worried yellow shit was still coming out of it and i got paranoid it was infected so i told my older sister who s she was really worried when she saw it and she made jokes about it that kind of made me feel better but hurt sometimes she decided the best thing was to get my parents i was panicking and didn t want to do i got her to get them downstairs they asked if i did it to myself i said yes they began yelling at me fueled with anger my dad was squeezing my arm and touching my cuts that hurt like hell my mom was the most angry i held back tears but their yelling is what made me cry she was cursing at me making me feel like shit for waking them up it s all a blur really but i remember saying i just feel like a burden my mom laughed and said i was being dramatic and kept saying omg that s how i felt though like a weight being dragged around constantly needing help that i don t ask for my mom made me sleep in her room my dad on the couch like always i begged to just sleep on the couch or in my sisters room but she just said no which i understand i couldn t sleep that night her room even in our old house makes me uneasy i m wide awake my insomnia didn t help either my dad took my phone i was grounded from seeing my friends my room etc i just wanted a hug support from them but what did i expect my parents have always been abusive idk why i didn t guess they d make me feel even shittier to make matters worse both my psychiatrist and therapist just moved so no more of that my pills have been needing refills for weeks but it never happened they never took my depression seriously i ve been diagnosed with depression anxiety ocd add an insomnia i withdrawal from my meds and drugs like weed and xan the next morning i woke up early like early i spent the day watching the office i just wanted to laugh my mom of course got angry but didn t do much about it i changed my bandaids on my own my parents didn t bother with it too much even though it was at an extreme risk of infection i asked friends and strangers if it looked infected and read how to keep it clean there was still puss coming out which wasn t normal i asked my mom but she blew it off i didn t know what to do but keep cleaning it i slept in my sisters room that night the next day my day had bought spray on liquid bandage that i ve never heard of i found out later it should be used for minor cuts he sprayed it inside of the cut i have a high pain tolerance but i almost cried he kept pinching my cuts i told him i could do it but he kept denying it i put on more medical tape and it hurt all day i regret telling them so much my friend recommended calling suicide hotline to get cps involved but i couldn t do that to my younger sister so i never did ive been feeling pretty empty even right now my cuts have healed pretty well but my mind has blocked out a lot of the memory of what happened my friend the one i called the night of told me yesterday you know you said something the night u made that cut that really stuck with me you said you weren t even scared or anxious you just did it cause it felt so good is that true i was shocked at that i didn t know what to say i knew it was true but i didn t want it to be i told my boyfriend and he was really scared he told me imagine how scary it is for me trying to have a life w you and not knowing if i can cos idk if youll be alive i felt awful the first deep cut i did i told him he was focused on how he felt and how much i hurt him it sucked but we ve gotten through it don t get me wrong he s absolutely amazing and everything i could ask for i know how hard it is to handle something like this i m paranoid a lot he s going to find someone better or he s lying that he loves me he s always reassuring me though i feel bad for having so many problems he has to deal with i ve been feeling the urge to cut and do xan more and more i haven t though i m trying to get through it i feel hopeless and constantly tired all the time i wish to be dead at times wishing i could disappear the times i ve tried killing myself and fail i feel like i can t do anything right i cant wait to move out of my house i want this all to be over i m so scared

I JUST WANNA BE APPRECIATED a month ago i asked a nice girl in our hich school to get to know me not dating but as friends she told me politely no because our values were different i had waited a long time to ask her to meet me after school because i thought she was nice and everything i knew we had some different opinions but that s not really a problem because my best friends have the exact opposite opinions than i do i was really disappointed when she told me she didnt want to get to know me so this happened today my yr half brother was drinking in a bigger city and needed money because he had no place to go but had money for drinking with friends he and his mom and sister messaged and called me several times and asked me to borrow some money i told i could pay his bus ticket if he wanted to go home and he refused i told them i wont pay a hotel room because i want him to get better and take responsibility they all got mad and my brother said he wont be helping me in the future and then hang up he doesnt respect me at all and only calls when needs money i dont have good relationship with my parents either they dont really appreciate me and my dad once almost killed me a few years ago i just want to be loved im trying to fix our relationship but they make it hard sometimes and then a girl who goes the same high school as i do but is not following me on social media just messaged me and asked if she can ask something personal related to my religion then i just thought okay i dont give a sh t anymore and i wrote a LONG message to her explaining how people only think im this boring religious person and nothing more and im not and i told her i was used to bullied at school and that people at school didnt know how hard my personal life was i told her that i am religious but my best friends are not i am religious but i do other things as well than just read the Bible and so when she had read what i wrote she just told me i shouldnt tell people how i feel probably she was right but i thought she would say something else everything what i had just told her was forgotten and she didnt say anything about it she only asked the question and i answered her the thing is almost everyone almost every person in our school has like friends and are friends with everyone and then there is me i have one friend in our whole student school im thankful i have her but ive always wanted to have many friends and i just dont know how to get them ive tried but no what im saying is that i am way much more than just my religion although it s the most important thing to me and i can be fun and do stuff like sneak from bathroom window at night with my friends or travel to random city and stay at star hotell loose all money and ask strangers to donate me a a few dollars and i like watching cat or duck tiktoks or those tiktoks where people are tell me you are a robot without telling me you are a robot and i love watching netflix hbo disney etc i cry when i think about this world and i pray for people that dont even know i exist i would die for you who are reading this and i am super loyal to my friends i would like more people to acknowledge me im not the best person in the world and im actually pretty stupid and mean sometimes but i can be a true and loving friend if people just wanted go get to know me thank you for reading God bless you btw im a year old girl,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

At war with my self sabotageHi I was diagnosed with depression years ago My abusive family didn t care about my meds so I had to be reanimated after suicide attempt as a teenager As an adult I endured being homeless twice years then a few months progressing disability sight loss suspicion of MS chronic pain and other constant lack of money selling myself for a place to live a year when I stayed in bed for days skipping showers and food I managed to finish school after years of dropping out I became homeless while still attending high school and even got accepted at uni our schools are free I did my best to follow meds and therapy plans worked on myself and my reactions tried to be more open to people After ten years of hard mental work I finally can notice and name my emotions see that not choosing is still a choice and understand how my head works All my friends say I ve changed a lot and for better Yet I have a new crisis For last year I ve been slowly ruining my education by skipping classes and not using opportunities created by pretty decent uni authorities I m stuck in therapy because I can t make any further progress until I force myself to do something change something It feels almost physical when I try to shove myself into sticking with my own plans even though they re not big ones I tried to get a part time job to get back on job hunting market but I had to quit it after damaging my sight even more Right now I m at the verge of becoming homeless again got kicked out of the uni and with no money for most meds I already asked my friends to pay some bills and meds for me and I don t want to ask too often I see how my self destructive part gains more and more power over the reasonable one however I still can see how ridiculous it is I m really afraid that after two years with no serious suicide thoughts I ll do something irreversible I also get urges to cut my arms which I hadn t done for almost years I feel safer when doing nothing even though I know it s way more dangerous Today I cried in the middle of street because I can t take this amount of stress anymore How does one force themselves to act How to motivate yourself to fight I m sure I want to live but I m also sure I m not able to live this way anymore Suicide seems like bad decision but the only one which can give me some peace I see it like a tooth removal you don t want to get rid of your teeth but it s so damaged it s the only way to get rid of pain,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I think I m done with life My depression has been raging over the last few months and I hinged everything on a doctor s appointment that I had today I ve had unsightly chest back acne since I was And I ve been to doctors tons of times for treatment oral antibiotics and a myriad of topical gels Of course here I am years later and not a single one of those treatments helped In january I decided that I d make one last bid for treatment I d go to my doctor and insist on accutane Despite the side effects It seems to have a high success rate for treatment resistant acne And I d rather have months of pure hell with an outcome where I can look in a mirror and not hate myself than live even another day as I am now knowing that I ll always be self conscious about my body and hate myself everytime I look in a mirror Now of course because I m an American And our healthcare system fucking blows I couldn t actually see a doctor for this until a month and half later Where I show the Dr my skin explain how long I ve been suffering and how miserable I feel looking at it I express my desire to go on Accutane And of course he immediately shuts that down Instead deciding in his infinite ignorance that the solution was to give me a combination of two topical gels Ones I had already tried separately with no fucking improvement This of course tanks my mood to the point of basically shutting down communication All I can think of is how I want to die and this fuckwad doctor wants to jerk me around with a worthless treatment He then prods me about why I m suddenly so morose and I lose my shit tell him how my bad skin is one of the confidence destroying things in my life that I fucking hate myself and break down in the room But instead of being helpful he uses it as a reason to start trying to throw psych meds at me This is what I get for trying to improve my life So why the fuck should I even bother living anymore,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13, it was from a school councillor. Later things were being a lil simple but then I lost my best friend. So it’s weird, she left me and my coping mechanism was to assume that she died. I feel it’s real. I’ve severe anxiety, like all physical symptoms. I’ve them all, just that I don’t sweat. Anxiety attacks, panic attacks are a normal part of my life since past two years.
 I’ve lost so many people now that I’m not weak but broken now. All were family (no breakup).
 I’m afraid I’ve BPD, I’ve all 8/9 symptoms. I don’t wanna self diagnos but I feel it’s real.
 I feel everything just so intense that can’t even discribe.
 Sometimes I feel I’m making mental illness, I’m fake is all I feel when no symptoms around.
 I’ve chest pain almost all day in breaks, sometimes mild, sometimes strong. It’s just so pathetic. I feel as a complete fake and unknown person. Can’t recognise what are my choices and who am I?
 Can someone tell me do I’ve BPD or am I faking?
 Anxiety and Depression are real but sometimes I think that’s also fake.
 Can’t go for professional help as I’m 17 rn and there are things so, I’ll go for professional help when I’ll be 18 and get a college admission.
 Please helps people.
 I’ve told about ya symptoms to many people but half them mocked me and made fun and others just showed sympathy which I hated. I feel also, just so alone.

I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff have been unemployed for years so I will be choosing between suicide and very soon Open to unusual suggestions Just read the bold text as a TL DR if you want amp x B Background I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree German that I deeply regret in December The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues I have a little OCD some Borderline Personality Disorder traits and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis I have spent out of the years since I graduated unemployed It took me a year to find a job I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly That happened just eight months after I had left my parents house I didn t even make it a year on my own That was a year and a half ago I cannot find a fucking job I have tried everything amp x B The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree Over the past month for example I have applied to jobs and only made it to a nd round in person interview times So here we are amp x B I m ready to die I have a note and a plan amp x B I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the people who are part of my life behind I have read enough of r SuicideBereavement to know what it d do to them and I don t care most of the time amp x B My suicide method of choice is irreversible Guaranteed to kill me This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn t take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn t high enough I will be gone Thus I must be very certain about having no other options left amp x B Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you ll say why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents That is not something I can accept I didn t push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now there is no way I could work at Macy s or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself amp x B I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine amp x B At this point I don t know what the fuck I can do Here are the things that occur to me at this point in order from most reasonable to least amp x B Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a temp to permanent role that actually pans out The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house even if it is full time amp x B Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide amp x B Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language TEFL certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway I have a car that is worth around that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification amp x B Accept my suicide as inevitable living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else k gets you a long way in a third world country You may laugh at this but I m actually kind serious about this one amp x B Kill myself Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it That s it This miserable existence I never asked for would be over I have had sex fallen in love been to Europe enjoyed meaningful friendships done psychedelics Its been nice But I can t take this shit anymore at the same time Every day is the same Sitting at this fucking desk Miserable Insane Lonely Hopeless I think about suicide constantly amp x B Do you have any ideas for me What would you do amp x B,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress,

I do not think I have depression but I have definitely gone through phases of self harm and numbness I try and stay as positive as possible to try and hide myself from my friends and family and I think it working. I think a friend saw my scars on my shoulder when I was getting ready and he may of told the rest of my friends. I feel like know cares about anything important and we are becoming emotionless robots trying to sustain life while still continuing out self destructive behaviour. Anyone else think this?

Breathing is painful for me Every breath hurts chronic pain makes it hard to keep goingI meant that it literally hurts for me to breathe not that it hurts to exist In I had a turbinate reduction Turbinates are bony structures in the nose that warm and humidify the air you breathe Because the procedure was botched my turbinates no longer do their job The air I breathe is cold and harsh I get constant headaches my throat is always dry because the air I breathe is dry and my nose is too open so the air pounds the back of my throat when I inhale As a result I have trouble sleeping hence why I am posting this at almost AM I feel a drowning sensation if I sniff too hard I have moments where my nostrils just burn They call this Empty Nose Syndrome a condition many doctors won t acknowledge They literally think it doesn t exist I exhibit all of the symptoms that come with this disease except for the defining symptom which is feeling like you re suffocating I m thankful I don t feel the worst symptom but also feel like if I did I would have killed myself long ago and maybe that would have been a good thing because it would mean my suffering would not have gone on for years but because I don t feel that symptom I m hesitant to call it that It s easy to tell someone things will get better because a lot of the time they do But sometimes I m not so sure you can tell that to someone suffering from chronic physical pain especially from something which is rare and has no cure My turbinates will never grow back My only hope is that there will be advances in regenerative medicine in my lifetime that are amazing enough to restore missing nasal tissue I don t see that happening especially when the focus is on helping people with much more common conditions I m invisible to the medical community I haven t been happy since my breathing was ruined I hate that breathing hurts because it s literally the one thing people have to do all the time It s hard to focus on things because the pain is so distracting I m going to wrap up my second bachelor s degree a degree in Computer Science in the fall and it kind of sucks knowing it would have been so much easier if breathing just felt normal again Same applies to all the things I like doing I enjoy everything less because I have to breathe while doing it obviously Playing games making music spending time with my loved ones all of it I enjoy life less because of it to the point where I m not sure it s worth living anymore I d go into six figures of medical debt today if I knew I could get my turbinates back I d trade this for cancer in a heartbeat at least you can beat cancer and at least it kills you if you lose the battle instead of making you suffer until you die I d go back in time years if it meant I could change the decision to walk into the operating room I d rather deal with the congestion I used to have any day of the week I hate feeling like a prisoner in my own body and I feel like killing it means I win Not a day goes by that I don t think about killing myself I m certainly not going to do it this week or this month Maybe after I achieve a lot of the things I wanted to achieve because there are still things I want to do before I die But if I am ever in a mall and a mass shooting takes place I promise you that I ll be the first person charging at the shooter Best case scenario I m a hero and saved a ton of people Worst case scenario I m a victim and nobody has to feel guilty for my killing myself That s my rant I m going to try to fall asleep again If anyone took the time to read all of this thank you and you re free to message me or comment,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Alternatives to seeking help Hey so over the summer there have been longer times sometimes over several weeks where I ve felt what must be almost completely normal I had an almost positive or at least hopefull view of my future things interested me again and I got like a spark in my soul to do things I could talk to people and handle conflicts without any issues or anxiety and even heavily boosted my confidence from any social contacts What struck me the most was that I went to sleep at peace every night confident even an looking forward to the next day Anyway well that s all gone now and my depressed shitty thoughts torment me all night and the thought of suicide lingers in the back of my head all day which I mostly spend doing absolutely nothing and having anxiety now from all social contact even social mistakes I might have made during the time I felt better I know now that I can t escape this on my own I just accidentally stumbled into having a few good weeks by some lucky coincidences in my life and since that s all gone now I know I need outside help amp nbsp amp nbsp If you want to stop reading right here the problem in a nutshell is that I have from experience lost all faith and respect for professional psychiatry psycology Does anyone now of any kind of alternatives that doesn t require me to spill my soul out to any person or therapist who would most likely be incompetent won t have the time just wants to get my money while doing as little as possible amp nbsp amp nbsp The long story is I tried getting help a long time ago when my depression forced me to quit med school before even the first tests of the first term I went to the state health provider in my country and just got worse from it They made me see different doctors at each appointment every one of which needed to hear my story from the start which I really hated to tell people I had just met My meds where changed almost every second week for no reason since the antidepressants I mostly got need around a month to even show effect After around a month and a half of this I tried to kill myself with prescribed anti anxiety meds and alcohol woke up in the hospital where a new psychiatrist made me promise to her personally that I would not kill myself until I came to see her again two days later I did but she was apparently busy walked past me in the waiting hall without acknowledging me so I got to meet a fourth year med student this time doing her clinical experience time or something She drilled me about if med school was too hard for me I told her no since we hadn t even reached the first exams yet but she ended up writing that as the probable cause on my medical papers anyway For me this was like a fellow med student writing I was literally shit on official papers any kind of confidence I had completely destroyed and I just felt abandoned by the whole thing So a few weeks later when a different doctor forgot to set up a new appointment before which another doctor had refilled my prescription for the same anti anxiety meds while saying no joke you must have run out of them by now I just allowed myself to slip through their cracks and disappear amp nbsp Around six months later I tried to get help again from a private psychiatrist which felt like it was going well I got the meet the same person every week and got to know him and felt confidence in him and everything I told him how I was feeling every week and while he couldn t pinpoint a cause or a solution I thought he was working towards something Until one day shit hit the fan completely and I got really really suicidal I went to the next appointment with my parents and he told me he couldn t help me anymore I was too serious For the several months I had been going to him and assuming he knew what he was doing and working towards something with the questions he was asking he actaully had no idea but didn t think to mention it until I got really suicidal again and was a danger to becoming a bad statistic in his records I got the blame both from him and my parents since if I really had been honest with him he would have known I would be getting seriously suicidal again before it happened My parents actually chalked up the failure of the state health provider to mostly be because of me not being honest and cooperative enough with them too after this amp nbsp amp nbsp So if any of you read all the way here you know why I don t want to get back into any of this shit again it only made me worse But now I m feeling suicidal and shitty again and I know I can t fix it by myself so what other options do I have,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"Lately, I’ve been very depressed, and my BPD has been the worst it has in a while. I feel like 99% of the time I’m dissociating, or smoking weed, which doesn’t even help me anymore because I’ve developed such a high tolerance. I feel like I’ve been a jerk to my girlfriend, who is also my FP. I’ve been a jerk to my friends too. I barely speak anymore. I barely do anything. I just dissociate all day and stare blankly. But I also fly off the handle easily. The smallest thing will make me irrationally upset or angry, and it’s really hard for me to control it. I know I’ve been horrible and toxic, and the shame I feel for all my actions seems to weigh me even deeper. The more toxic I get, the more ashamed and filled with self hatred I become, and the more I hate myself, the more angry and emotionally erratic I get. I don’t know what to do. I’m on anti depressants, and I feel like they worked really well for me at first, but now they don’t work very well at all and I’m right where I was before I was hospitalized a few months ago.

I think I need to check myself into a hospital I need your guys advice weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder It wasn t really news I ve known I ve been depressed for years approaching years now I got prescribed Zoloft and I m up to mg now I ve also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about weeks now Its not working though If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse and it feels like it s not even getting worse at a slower rate Over the last few years I ve made a lot of changes to try to help I went from to I started eating healthier I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects I transferred colleges since the first one wasn t working out I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends I even attended my first college party after years of never being invited to anything Now I ve finally gone to get professional help both psychologic and psychiatric And none of it has helped If anything its only gotten worse since I don t even have the hope that any more changes will help The hope is gone When I was a kid I used to get Pneumonia a lot I had it like times before I was I wish I d have just died back then I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me The latest I think I would be happy if thing has been getting in a relationship I think I m thinking this is the latest thing since its one of the only changes I haven t yet made and because I pretty genuinely hate myself I ve pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA I don t really believe in inherent self worth I m almost now and haven t ever been on a date let alone received a non platonic hug Nobody ever expresses interest in me I always have to initiate thought I ve found this is usually the case with my friends as well if I don t initiate I d never get invited to anything I can t even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit It s not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to It feels like all the changes I ve made over the years have amounted to nothing I m just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time I haven t been able to cry in years so I just self harm when I feel like crying It s not the best release and it feels like it has diminishing returns since lately it doesn t give me the rush it used to it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense Besides it beats drinking heavily like most normal people my age do though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers It feels like I ve gotten left behind on the road of life Everyone is dating some are already married with people they love I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I ve started dating yet I keep trying to explain to him that I m trying but not having any luck Whenever dating comes up that s all I ever get I m sure you ll find someone eventually Thing is none of the I d might be happy if things before have obviously failed but this is the only change left I can make since professional and medical help has failed I don t enjoy anything anymore Dota and CSGO feel like chores EU is too frustrating now I ve already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through I don t enjoy running or hiking as much now and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year I don t have any shows I really enjoy I ve always wanted to learn to draw I m actually a huge fan of furry art but I m pretty bad and I m a perfectionist so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can t do it and get better Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better The logic I mean with get better is that zero is still larger than a negative number so I d be better off I used to think Ok I ll wait until I turn and then I ll kill myself if things haven t improved However as things have deteriorated I ve moved that up to More recently I ve moved it up to after graduation I m thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself I don t even know how I m going to make it that far Suicide feels inevitable at this point like its something I have to do I don t buy the whole it gets better thing anymore Its been over years It really doesn t in my experience All the medical advice I ve been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself I don t understand to what end though Like if I don t kill myself now then what I get to continue hurting tomorrow The only end this seems to lead to is why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum I don t see the appeal in it I think once I do it I ll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night Nobody would notice I m gone possibly for a few weeks nobody would hear a thing I might not even be found My body can feed some scavengers I don t have to hurt anymore people who love me don t have to see me hurt anymore everyone wins I ve been dead inside for years its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up Of course this is still likely a few years away so I m probably not at immediate risk of killing myself So thats where I m standing It s AM right now and I can t sleep anymore because I went to bed at last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again The Zoloft just gives me headaches makes me hungry and gives me constipation Nothing has helped and I don t think I can get better anymore I have another

"So within the past couple months ive came to the realization that I have to deal with my borderline and bipolar. 
 
 Been out of the dating scene for two years after a string of awful relationships. Me and this girl have talked as friends everyday for 6 months been dating for 3, and it’s great overall I love her very much. 
 
 With the new relationship ive found myself creeping into old thought patterns and codependency. I’ve never been to a psychiatrist or anything, just been obsessed with personal development since I was 14. It’s hard to deal with because logically she has done nothing to trigger these emotions.
 
 I thought I had these aspects of myself dealt with and released but there’s still more. I find myself worrying about every little change in energy or if she will just get bored and leave me. I feel as if I never do enough when I give my absolute all. It’s very confusing and I struggle on my end to not resent myself.
 
 I can’t afford going to therapy or anything but, I’m just wondering if anybody feels the same or has any advice. I really do love this woman and refuse to let bpd run me, it’s just so hard having the “flip” and spinning thoughts over nothing about someone you know cares about you.",Cause of Distress,Seeking Help

Lady Lazarus By Sylvia Plath I have done it again One year in every ten I manage it A sort of walking miracle my skin Bright as a Nazi lampshade My right foot A paperweight My face a featureless fine Jew linen Peel off the napkin O my enemy Do I terrify The nose the eye pits the full set of teeth The sour breath Will vanish in a day Soon soon the flesh The grave cave ate will be At home on me And I a smiling woman I am only thirty And like the cat I have nine times to die This is Number Three What a trash To annihilate each decade What a million filaments The peanut crunching crowd Shoves in to see Them unwrap me hand and foot The big strip tease Gentlemen ladies These are my hands My knees I may be skin and bone Nevertheless I am the same identical woman The first time it happened I was ten It was an accident The second time I meant To last it out and not come back at all I rocked shut As a seashell They had to call and call And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls Dying Is an art like everything else I do it exceptionally well I do it so it feels like hell I do it so it feels real I guess you could say I ve a call It s easy enough to do it in a cell It s easy enough to do it and stay put It s the theatrical Comeback in broad day To the same place the same face the same brute Amused shout A miracle That knocks me out There is a charge For the eyeing of my scars there is a charge For the hearing of my heart It really goes And there is a charge a very large charge For a word or a touch Or a bit of blood Or a piece of my hair or my clothes So so Herr Doktor So Herr Enemy I am your opus I am your valuable The pure gold baby That melts to a shriek I turn and burn Do not think I underestimate your great concern Ash ash You poke and stir Flesh bone there is nothing there A cake of soap A wedding ring A gold filling Herr God Herr Lucifer Beware Beware Out of the ash I rise with my red hair And I eat men like air,"Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update"
I feel unbearably lonelyHello well I ve been depressed since sophomore year October of I ve attempted suicide at least three times and was admitted to a psych institute February of I started feeling better but around the start of junior year I started to feel horrible again also my bf went back out with his ex girlfriend so that contributed to the depression I was raped in October and my parents found out so I got even sadder My boyfriend and I got back together which made things better for a little while But he never seems to care about whenever I m feeling sad or suicidal Whenever he s sad I do whatever I can to help But if I m crying or feeling hopeless he brushes it off So most of the time I just keep my feelings to myself Anyway it s on a daily basis that I find myself on the ground bawling nearly hyperventilating from crying so much I have literally no one to talk to about how I feel I don t cut anymore but I hit myself to feel some sort of relief My parents won t put me on antidepressants and my therapist doesn t help I m constantly fantasizing about my suicide I find comfort in planning it out in my head and I m also comforted by the fact that I could kill myself whenever I feel the need to I know I m young I know I have life ahead of me but I can t take daily breakdowns much longer It s becoming unbearable and I just feel physically exhausted from living I m not even completely sure why I posted here I guess because I used to find comfort in posting here old account and I even made a friend once I m sorry for all of the text I just needed a way to clear my head,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

story again and the emotions in me seem to be running permanently on empty now that it even gets insulted by people who think their lives are worst than mine been through alot since i was a kid and up to now exactly beatings mental abuse social abuse psychological abuse majority of which were really unjustified and questionable that had me made into the quiet pacifist type of a person since i love writing reading and playing music instruments mainly things that interest me i do to the fullest extent but it left people particularly counselors with the wrong impression i got wrongfully diagnosed with being a sociopath and a psychopath since they found what i wrote was completely disturbing my hobbies too weird and different and my actions of being way too quiet be too creepy i was forced to change my being sociable with friends and my writings and research that i only reserve to myself that i primarily use to improve myself led them to believe that i was purely a psychopath so i got isolated more like quarantined when i come to think of it which led to even more problems got into a bad motorcycle accident and went through alot of beatings and tons of abuse i got serious trust issues and never go out now what is worst is that everything i throw at myself to improve my life like getting hobbies gets either socially abused or just be used for jokes or towards people particularly towards the women i highly admired such bad jokes and humiliations are started majority by my friends and continued on by my family leading me to be isolated even more that its not even funny nearly every solution and fix that i put out gets shot down telling me that its not good enough for their standards which led me to having really horrible trust issues with people now because some of them are being too manipulative particularly towards me and in the absolute mess of things the majority of the people who put me in this position either wants me to go back or forces me to go back TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT by me and even being warned that i m damaging myself past the repair point risking permanent ruin when i know i m already done for and did everything i could and that i am way too emotionally traumatized to be fixed disappointed at the fact that it took them years to find out that what they were doing were wrong,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"wish I had died last year.I could not create anything today. I could barely sing. I feel like when quarantine began, I was meant to kill myself. Oh my God, I actually *regret* not killing myself last year.I exercised a little, showered, sight-read piano music for literally 10 minutes, sang for about 30 seconds until I hated my voice, and cuddled with my cat. Right when I started singing, I thought about how much I just want to stop doing anything anyone wants me to do. I do not want to sing. I do not want to be complimented. I do not want to be in a world full of people who wish the best for me and always want me to become something great, when all I want to do is die.I am not looking forward to anything. I am not even learning the script for my friends play yet, because I simply want to do nothing. I want to dissolve. I want to evaporate. I think about being dead and I feel so happy.

life just seems pointless im senior year i guess i ll start out with how i got to this point i started to feel down th grade around the time my grandpa was in the hospital which i wasn t close to he would come in and out of the hospital and i guess seeing him that way just hurt i dont even know why i felt that way when those words that he said when i was in th grade still lingered i still enjoyed doing simple things and still wanted to try out new things i bought a ukulele got in to drawing and tried making friends i actually met one of my ex best friend she will be coming up at the end it wasn t bad at all but i felt this nagging feeling above my head that i was able to ignore cut to th grade oh boy was that year fun thats when i started questioning why i was still even here breathing i started high school and most of my classes were filled with people from others schools which already had their own friends of groups compared to how i was in middle school i started to become real quiet my middle school wasn t that big and everyone pretty much knew everyone so it was easy for me to conversate with others at the end of th grade i also realized that i was starting to develop anxiety i would shake and my body temperature would go up amp was on the verge of passing out anyways as you can tell trying to talk to others was quite intimidating i started to feel alone and just isolated from everyone in my classes not only that i was in advanced classes and felt so stupid in all of them i couldn t even reach their level of intelligence i was dumb compared to all of them i no longer wanted to participate i would hate when teachers called on me it was the worst feeling ever oh i forgot to mention my grandpa died a month later after my freshman year started i pick up others emotions so i was sad would cry over everything and just felt like complete shit i had about friends at the time which i guess you could say i no longer am friends with them anyways school work started to pile up i started getting stressed about it and would even cry at times because i couldnt understand some of the stuff i started to develop some thoughts that weren t healthy in my head i would tell myself im stupid worthless all the teachers saw me as some excuse o a student and so on i started to just lock myself in my room and sleep i developed an eating disorder which i thought was normal at the time because teenagers right i wouldn t shower for days yet my anxiety kept me worried about how i looked imagine caring about what others think of you while you don t even care about yourself its a fucking pain in the ass i gained a friend that year but eventually cut ties with her during the summer th grade came along i continued to take advanced classes just to make my parents proud i wanted them to be proud of me and tell me that just one time turns out i just disappointed them more this is when i started to skip days at school telling my mom i felt sick and so once i even faked i was sick but it turned out i had strep throat kinda funny tbh ayways my grades started to go down i was usually and A or A B type of girl but my grades started going towards C s and at times D s I met this guy as well that i started to develop feelings for this was the first time i actually wanted to step out of my comfort zone and get to know them i still dont know till this day if it was a good or bad idea i honestly don t remember much about th grade year it seems a little fuzzy all i know is that my depression and anxiety got worse i was thinking about suicide more often and even thought of ways to do it just a reminder my parents and siblings had no idea that i was feeling down i would always act hyper and made jokes just to make them laugh i fake laughed and tried not to get them worried th grade i had only like adv class and an AP class to get myself to take a break i told myself at the end of th grade that i would get my shit together and even managed to get decent grades on the st weeks of school i started to have trouble sleeping my thoughts started to get more vivid and had nightmares i also almost passed out while talking in a group discussion because i was so anxious i dont know how many times i started to write suicide letters i would have breakdown every other month thst led me to just wanting to end it all this took place so last yeart then started everything started to go to shit the guy i mentioned earlier yeah i admitted my feelings towards him and he then started to talk to me less eventually we stopped talking completely mostly it being my fault i also lost my bestfriend i dont know what happened or what i did but we just stopped talking it hurt a lot it really fucking hurt i went days without eating and lost almost pounds i was pounds foot inchs so i finally became underweight that was the only thing i had under control my weight i felt at ease i liked seeing my ribs popping out i liked the way i looked for the first time even now i wish i would stop eating so much this was around the time finally talked to the counselor and my mom and sister came up and talked to them about how i was feeling when we walked out of school my sister just told me you should ve judt killed yourself in there i got a therapist around march i started taking medication went from lexapro prozac some sleeping pills and some other stuff i cant remember lexapro left me feeling numb i couldn t cry i couldn t feel a thing i remember explaining to my friend the feeling its as if you are trapped in the glass box and no matter how many times you try to break it and get out of there it didn t work you just yelled at no one when me and my bestfriend defriended i got a new friend i wasn t at the best state physically and mentally i wouldn t shower for a week i was just bone i would skip a lot of class oh yeah did i mention that i started skipping almost everyday i remember thinking whats wrong with me i wasn t like this how would i let myself get to this point i was someone that cared a out school even if it was challenging i wasn t one to get down over small or big things i wouldn t get hurt over one small comment almost at the end of march i first tried attempting with the lexapro i only took but i called my friends and they picked me up i spent time with them for a little while i stopped myself before i took more so im not sure if its really an attempt i didn t mention this to my therapist because you know i d get sent to the hospital weeks later i attempted again this time i took some pain killers it was at the time they were like mg per pill I just felt a little sick from the stomach but that was all I called my friend again and told her what was going on of them came over and talked to me my friend asked me if i wanted to tell my mom in which i did we ended up crying a lot she kept asking me why do i want to die why am i feeling like this why dont i see value in life do you know how shitty i felt i the person that lives in this body doesn t even know the cause my friends had called out but i started to act hyper i always do this to make others think i am doing well now they ordered pizza and we ate they both worked at the same place so they called the manager and told them that they could actually go in my heart broke a little that day i always wished someone would stay with me even when i told them the opposite they just left they believed i was doing well i ended up telling my therapist what i did a week later since thats when i was scheduled to go she ended up sending me to the hospital and told my mom that its best to do so or i ll end up succeeding although it was nice for me to not worry about anything anymore i didnt like it i wasn t with the people that i cared about all i needed was to be with the ones that cared and loved me even if they were acting as if they did thats all i needed i pushed them away so many times and i know its my fault i know i am the one to blame but i still felt even more depressed because i wanted them to tell me no i am not leaving i wanted them to just lay with me and hug me and just tell me everything was going to be okay even if i didnt believe that thats all i ever wanted june came along so school ended i tried again i tried overdosing on sleeping pills i took about this time even till this day i still have no clue what i meant to text one of my friends ah i forgot to mention the friend i gained after i lost my best friend dated my brother i started to like her a little after they broke up and she even admitted that she was kind of gaining interest on me while dating my brother i was so confused during this time though because she never told me straight forward if she liked me or not i wasn t in the best state of mind obviously so all that made sense to me was that she hated me she never liked me and just used me to gain information about my brother i had also stopped talking to my other friends and even stopped telling one of them the same one that works with her about what i was thinking because the first thing she would do is tell her anyways im pretty sure it caught her by surprise that i texted her that day and it not making any sense all i remember was going unconscious and then waking up several times i would try to plug in my phone to charge and i thought i would and would pass out and then wake up to do the same thing standing up was hard i almost fell because of how heavy my body felt thankfully i didn t throw up i hate throwing up cue to the next day i had my therapy appointment im surprised my therapist didn t ask if i was okay i was shaking a lot and couldn t focus i was still out of it and had the same feeling i had the day before but without feeling my body heavy passing out randomly and so i even drove that day which i know i shouldn t have but i wasn t thinking I can t even remember much of that day I do remember around pm though I started to text my friends I cant remember what i said or what they said i do remember getting angry and i started to get aggresive the last thing i told the friend that i liked at the time no wonder that my brother left you before that i do remember her saying that you can t help someone that doesn t want help thats all i can remember that just hit me for some reason all those months that i tried getting help seemed like nothing to her i was so fucking upset this was the same person that dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression someone that even attempted thats why it hurt so much i was trying so hard to get help even if it was hard for me to open up i was never taught to talk about my feelings so the fact that i told an adult meant that i seriously was in need of help i ended up blocking everyone and i cried so much i cried a lot it hurt it still hurts she even told me she thought of telling me that i should ve killed myself now i wish that she did say those words then i would have an actual reason i texted them the next day and told them i was sorry they forgave me which they shouldn t have maybe it was better and if we just left it like it was i still hate myself for saying those words till this day i haven t been the same ever since nothing feels real cut to th grade which is now i was planning on doing it on my birthday i wrote a note each day leading to it and i decided to do it days earlier i was supposed to start my first day at my job i called out and told my mom i was working i went to the park i was planning on slitting my wrist turned out the blade amp pocket knife didn t work so well on my wrist and barely did anything i didn t tell my friends about it and decided to just wait till my actual birthday thinking it was just the day you know my birthday came up and i was waiting for my friends to say happy birthday they didn t i posted on my story crying i wrote on the last note they forgot about my birthday the day i hated the most my birthday made me hate it even more i wasn t worthy of their time they saw my stort and felt bad and texted me they came to my house and gave me last minute gifts they felt forced i doubt they even wanted to be there cue to now i finally pushed them off for good i told them what i was planning and told them how i was feeling they ended up writing a letter to my mom like days ago and left it in the mail i was the one that went to get the mail that day i read it and i got really upset angry sad the people that i thought knew me the most wanted to send me to the hospital all i wanted was for them to stay with me not send me somewhere in which i feel trapped somewhere where they are not i got angry and texted them were involved in this one wasnt i texted on the gc where all were one the one that wasnt a part of it got upset over what i said the others didnt say anything until i said if that was all they got i started saying to tell me how they really feel about me because i knoe they are holding themselves back just because they are afraid i ll break i blocked all of them after that and now i have no reason for no longer to stay here even one of the people which were feeling suicidal a while back wated to send me to the hospital when i didn t even think about sending them there because i know it wasn t what they needed or wanted they needed to be with people that loved them and made sure they were safe i didnt get out of her car that day and told her i wasn t leaving she gave in and slept in my room why couldn t they do the same for me am i not worthy of having someone do that for me its kind of funny i was in my car the other day in the same spot we were in when we skipped school one day at that time i thought i was really alone but now now i ve actuall reached that i am alone now i have no one in the end i am the one that never deserved to be here i didn t deserve them i didn t deserve to live i should ve died a long time ago i dont know how long i ll be here there is no point in living anymore im just a walking robot at this point i no longer have anyone or anything to live for,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking,

At what point is it better to die than to live this way I ve been struggling with this condition for months now with no sign of recovery of my waking life my mind is blank completely devoid of mental activity It is a constant struggle of mine to maintain any form of awareness Additionally my short term and long term memory function at nearly amnesiac levels and my ability to focus and simply put think are at an atrociously low level My brain has a complete absence of mental activity This subjective experience is hard for me to quantify or explain but almost all the time my mind is completely blank like a zombie In a sense I m mentally catatonic like someone gave a computer the wattage of a light bulb just enough energy to give the appearance of awareness Every moment I m awake is a struggle to maintain some form of consciousness When not stimulated by loud music video games or the constant novelty of the Internet I zone out My mind is completely empty there is no thought whatsoever This brings me to my memory issues both short and long term trying to remember what I did as recently as yesterday requires a huge amount of effort Sometimes I ll be able to remember scattered details about the day before like where I had lunch but memories are scattered and non linear Trying to remember something that happened a day ago a week ago or a year ago feels the same There is just no clarity of memory I feel perpetually spaced out my mind feels foggy as though I m in a dream or under the influence of some substance I feel awake yet not awake sleepy although im physically fully awake I have trouble with social interaction because I just don t know what to say most of the time Frequently i have to stop and think of a decent response just to look normal because otherwise there d be nothing I have to say The times I do have something to speak up on I often stutter because I have trouble finding the right words to use or put them together in a sentence There are times where I ll just mentally blank out mid utterance and have not a clue what I wanted to say next I feel like I m just existing in this one moment with no past no connection to the present and no future I d rather die than live the rest of my life as this empty shell of a person,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking","Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Progress Update"

Could anyone give me advice I ve had psychological problems for as long as I can remember and I ve reached out for help so many times but no matter what I do nothing changes The first few times I asked for help I told my parent I was depressed This was when I was barely a teenager and she just did the normal parent thing of saying What do you have to be depressed about Then a few years later I started self harming and not attending school My school made me see a psychologist for low attendance but they said I was fine My Mother told them about my self harming which I m sure they already knew about if and this psychologist said it s just trendy and that her son does it because he s a Goth Those words makes me cringe to this day My Mother took me to my GP anyway and they refused me to refer me to any mental health service and gave me a leaflet for a mental health service of which I was not within the age range I later dropped out of school I started drinking to deal with it then having strange symptoms derealisation depersonalisation I was having panic attacks multiple times everyday and completely socially isolates myself for a few years I felt terrible all the time and was deeply disturbed by my thoughts When things got a little better I decided to go back to school as I had no qualifications and went on to study a course which could get me into University studying a science related degree I found the work stupidly easy and went through with good grades By the time I was on my last year my mental health was deteriorating quickly I could no longer concentrate or function at school or in any other area of my life I went to my GP and they asked me some irrelevant questions about my Father none about my symptoms apart from weight loss gain and sleep Then refused to give me SSRI s I went home and some time later my memory is a blur I tried to kill myself I ve now had two serious attempts at taking my life and I m positive there s no way for me to get help but if I don t get help soon I know I m going to try again And I know it will likely work this time I ve tried to get help so many times I can t even leave my house anymore I don t know what to do Nobody is taking me seriously and I have no idea what s wrong with me How can I get help I ve even tried reaching out to people working in the NHS Nothing comes of it I have people who depend on me and I don t want to put my potential to waste but I m running out of time and I ve tried everything I can I don t even have the emotional energy anymore I m not scared of dying and the idea is quite appealing to me regardless of my mental state so if it happens it happens I have multiple mental health problems as well as sensory processing problems relating to a neurodevelopment disorder I have and just existing is torture to me Even when my mental health is okay I want the suffering to end I m so so tired I just need to know that I tried for the people I care about and my own philosophical reasons And I would do anything in my power to turn this situation around If anyone can offer any advice to me then please leave a comment Anything you have to say will be helpful to me,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Life is pain m My life story is long upsetting and frankly a little unbelievable at points so I ll spare all those details despite the fact that they give context to my suffering The point is is that recently I ve moved states because I wanted to leave a very stressful job I had elsewhere I now live with my father who is mostly insensitive and mechanical in regards to my existence The extent of his relationship with me seems to be him asking why I don t make much money and constantly telling me to get another job and suggesting random jobs for me to do He also says I should just get up and go even though I have no emotional motivation Unfortunately I now have a tedious and mundane job working at a call center and it feels as if my mind has been put through an incredibly dull blender The majority of my co workers are in their sixties or more and what few people I can relate to don t care enough about me to remember I exist outside of the office so I don t have a strong friend group or support system What s more is that I was recently diagnosed with genital HSV I ve had two sex partners my entire life and I know I got it from my first one because we had unprotected sex once and the infection is localized to a point that is usually covered by a condom She decided to ignore me a long time ago so I can t tell her about it Anyway with a lack of money a car friends and now the end of my hope for a sex life I no longer want to live I ve felt that way for some time now but the feeling is especially strong now I have been diagnosed with clinical depression in the past No offense but I don t need to be told that things will get better and that I just need to hold on Are there any suggestions as to what I can do I m not stoic enough to put myself through rigorous daily exercise The pain of it outweighs any other feeling I get I do take a lot of long walks,"Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Too sick and poor to liveSicknesses I am blind in one eye scarred retina from birth have hypothyroidism and an undiagnosed stomach condition that I was told was barrette s stomach gastro paresis or my kidneys aren t filtering my blood correctly some sort of porphyria I get nauseated after every other meal I puke dry heave for hours and sit in a hot shower until it turns cold and then sit in a cold shower for an hour until I am nearly hypothermic Sometimes when in the hot water I dump ice water over my head to body shock the sickness away for a few seconds This gives me terrible colds that just add to the misery I ended up in the hospital for four days when I became so dehydrated that my kidneys were shutting down and my muscles were cramping up from lack of sodium I was given scopolamine Zofran and morphine When I was stable enough to hold down a bite of pancake they sent me home with a forty thousand dollar hospital bill and the recommendation that I see a specialist I applied for charity assistance from the hospital and have not seen a hospital bill since so I hope that money is not owed anymore A few months later I was lucky enough to get decent affordable health insurance which I used to get every test conceivable These tests went on for years and I was never given a definitive diagnosis My mother had end stage COPD and congestive heart failure She was on oxygen and could not leave the house She couldn t even make herself a meal without nearly suffocating to death My step father had throat cancer and liver cancer My step father had radiation treatment for the throat and liver but the throat cancer came back He then had a full laryngectomy When he came home from the hospital he was on a feeding tube and I had to crush his pills and feed him a liquid diet through his feeding tube He also needed his stoma cleaned and suctioned and a surgical wound that opened up packed and treated I did all this while also making meals for my mother doing the store runs laundry cleaning house and dealing with my own sickness The day after my th birthday in July my mother died from heart failure My Step father had been home from the hospital for one week when she passed and could not even speak They were married for years My step father s liver cancer has now come back and I fear he doesn t have long My finances I have been out of work for the past years I moved in with my mother and step father when I got too sick to work It worked out well for the three of us for the past years because despite my illness I was still able to take care of my terminally ill parents We were able to survive financially because of my parents disability checks and long term settlement check of per month and two rentals properties that were owned with no mortgage as long as there were renters anyway My uncles and my grandfather s ex wife which he was married to for years after the passing of his first wife of years now have complete control and ownership of the two rental units This past year the sickness has subsided somewhat and I want to get back to work but am afraid Afraid that the sickness will hit at work and get me fired again afraid to get back into to job market after being out for so long I inherited and now own my home with no mortgage but cannot pay the property taxes and insurance I am told I cannot take a mortgage out on my house because I don t have a job I also inherited a per month settlement check that will run out in two years It is not enough to live off and pay the taxes and insurance I also had to hire a lawyer in order to get the house and checks because my mother s will was not valid due to having been notarized with only one witness not two as per my state s law I still owe that lawyer dollars I am racking up penalties for the taxes I have yet to pay I will also be losing my health insurance at the end of this month because the premiums are going up by for the lowest tier plan It will be extremely difficult to try and find a roommate to move into the house because the house is in a state of disrepair and my terminally ill step father is in the master bedroom Who would want to move in with one sick dude and one terminally ill dude Plus the bedrooms are tiny I have two uncles One is in credit card debt and will offer no help the other has gifted me dollars since my mother s death but I cannot ask for more I have no idea how I am going to pay the bills next month I owe to a lawyer in medical bills that I know of in student loan debt in property taxes that are accruing penalties and about dollars a month in expenses insurance electric water etc I have A home valued by the city at but would sell for maybe due to that state of disrepair and per month for the next two years My plan I will leave a hand written will valid in this state leaving the house to my step father I will then acquire a small boat or kayak I will load a back pack with weights and travel as far east into the Atlantic Ocean as I can in one night Enjoy the stars and one last sunrise I will them get into the water wearing the backpack while hanging off the edge of the boat Then I will shoot myself through the brain This way if the bullet does not kill me the water will My body will sink into the depths below and that will be the end of me There will be no clean up no coroner no funeral just gone disappeared from the world

Dear my friends who read this and everyone else Hi I m James You have never met me or will likely never do so I am a depressed year old boy who is trapped in life and a viscous circle It started at the ripe old age of Entering Year th grade I always knew adjusting into a secondary school wouldn t be the easiest but hell I tried getting on with everyone It seem some people just don t get along I was average weight for a guy my size and was always healthy Now however is no longer the case You see bullying destroyed me Not in the sense of mentally where i just lost it one day and lashed out No it literally picked my life apart and my future bit by bit The person i was back in Year th grade no longer exists I was happy looking ahead to what could be an amazing life with a nice enough personality likeability and body to go with it But that changed I got along well with the group of friends I joined in the second year of my secondary school Though we were classified as I suppose the nerdy ones Up to this point everything was fine That is when I was destroyed forever past present and future I started to get bullied then again so do a lot of kids but it affected me more than others For months I would take the bullying and abuse shrugging it off but I was comfortable I started eating more and more to feel safe it was my little thing i always held close food It was like an anti bullying anti depressant for me it was weird but nevertheless what comes with eating more food is weight I started gaining weight out of control I went from this little lbs kid to over lbs in a matter of a couple months I could no longer run hell even jog By mid end of Year I was heavily obese with asthma problems But i wouldn t run or exercise in general because i was still made fun out of You know fat fuck running to loose some weight yeah I was but I said i was just going somewhere and would just stop running Moving on i was bullied through my schooling more and more Still gaining more and more weight by the start of Year it was Suddenly noticed by a relatively new teacher a teacher who came to be a saving grace Though too little to late a saving grace nevertheless This teacher we ll call him John saw me gaining weight eating way more than i should getting told off for eating in class or slagging off daydreaming probably about killing myself or how much better my life would be somewhere else Now in the UK year is the final year for schooling so it was highly important to revise for exams and get through the school day This I could not do hell I couldn t even get to school without being out of breath or faking an illness to get a day away John finally gave in and gave me the rest of the year off to revise for exams and get prepared for the end of the year I never did prepare i slept my days away glad that i would never have to go back apart from exams where i was separated from the people who destroyed my life I did my exams and failed most of them Completing my schooling This was the best thing that had ever happened to me leaving this place Though it still lived on in my head and heart killing me every time i thought about it Even to this day if i have to walk past or drive past the school i end up in tears over the time i spent there The only person i have to thank in my life the only person who cared Who gave a damn The only person who loved me like a brother Who saw the pain the suffering The times i said i wanted to kill myself Wo then went and told John the person who saved me more than anyone else could My friend Niall He is part of my little family My true saving grace Months of grief even after leaving the school i kept saying i was ok even though dying inside I luckily got accepted into a college that i did fine at I stopped eating as much though Still way more than i should I was left alone there i didn t know anyone made no friends and was alone THIS is where everything stopped being about the bullying and the shit i was given at my last school But inside i knew they caused me to be overweight and not great to look at So now i was lonely and sunk into deep depression a depression i never uttered a word about for years I dropped out of my college for personal issues and had months off Still obtaining a good grade from that college i moved into another one immediately as the next school year turned over Thinking i was over from all this shit thought everything was ok after my months off It was not i entered the new college where there were girls everywhere with boyfriends being happy my mind slipped back into a state of horrific depression worse than anything else I started eating more and more again on top of that i was still lonely with know one i know attending this college either After weeks at the college i cracked to my parents i cried for hours that day pouring years of abuse and depression all at once but never once uttering i was lonely because the way to deal with it is loose weight and become healthy young guy again become who i wanted to be since i was that little th grader But i knew that i was never going to be that person so i decided what i was going to do But that would have to wait First i went to my doctor who put me on the SSRI Citalopram i was taking mg for weeks to no effect I was then moved up to mg and i was sent to emergency youth counselling I was there for weeks once a week Telling this woman everything about me and what went on not once crying or hurting It was just nice to feel free telling someone that was going to tell know one else about the real side of my depression After the first week i told my closest friend Niall about the real side of me everything I continued on with counselling as did my depression The Citalopram didn t work After weeks i told my councillor that i was fine and that she helped a lot But she knew that i wasn t fine I started to self harm and drink making myself more depressed and wallowing in self pity I went out a lot of times one month with friend told not to drink But i still did I self harmed more and more Then the best thing that ever happened in my life came up It was a weekend in mid April A weekend i was looking forward to no special event i just was Niall invited me to an anime convention Now i wasn t even an anime fan I d only ever watched Gurren Lagann but i went along and for that one weekend i was free I was happy i had camera round my neck and by GOD did i abuse it I used it as an excuse to talk to people Girls mostly I got more love and affection in that one weekend than i did in my entire life I was truly not alone or unhappy I had people notice the cuts all down my arm being only a day or old they were raised and red Rather easy to see Though know one questioned them and for that i was happy That one weekend was the best days of my life Thank you for that Niall After that i was next sent to the doctor weeks after initial counselling ended The doctor saw my wounds and suggested i go to a psychiatrist So naturally i did still on the citalopram so at this point i was still depressed The psychiatrist put me on a new drug called Mirtazapine i was in mg of the stuff for weeks and it did a hell of a lot more than the citalopram ever did I was feeling better I wasn t depressed but i was still a bit lonely Now i not usually the one to beg people or bother them but the only other assistance i had stopping me killing myself was music this artist in particular being Veela one night i sent her this email http i imgur com PPbHq png I didn t expect a reply from her being as popular as she is I mean she made some pretty popular music http www youtube com watch v HzBL nK Zo among the gaming community To my surprise she did Not by a simple little email either she went out of her way to record me a video http www youtube com watch v sdTfm LzHXk amp feature youtu be which was attached to a tiny email simply saying lt http i imgur com Eizlr png Now i was super excited that i got some love from some relatively unknown Canadian girl I was extremely happy I am much happier now and I m grateful for my friends that i have and for Veela keeping my little boat afloat some

I m literally hopeless and will end my life in a few daysYes I fucking am There is no hope for me I m sick rn not covid tho and despite that will cut myself anyway I ve lived in a mental hospital for two years I have tried all the kind of therapies they specifically have to offer I m sixteen and we already started trying antidepressants for adults bc I tried the ones that kids are allowed to get already Nothing worked I am almost at the highest dose and after that they can t help me try other ones bc they don t have enough experience My problems are now too complex and heavy for them and they have no other options for me to try therapies again I ve already had for years without success I told them over two months ago I wanted to switch completely and go to another place where they have more therapies and meds I can try and where they are completely focused on ppl like me With chronic severe and complex problems Because at the place I m treated at rn that s just very often not the case so they really lacked acute and good help the first few months They told me they would talk ab it with my parents and me TWO MONTHS later and I told them everything was getting worse and to be able to go in conversation with them my mental health shouldn t worsen I asked them for more temporarily more intense help but they never came back to me so i was left with medication appointments and therapy sessions that didn t help And as i thought everything took a turn for the absolute worst I got worse and worse and i was falling back in all of my bad behaviors and coping mechanisms I cut deeper than ever before didn t do anything and started interacting with my anorexia again that had actually been pushed away and not that bad for the past few months I had the convo a few days ago I didn t want anything because i wanted to die more than ever They said they needed me if i wanted other therapy I told them i didn t want it anymore and i wanted to die They suggested i got admitted to the mental hospital again which is basically of my trauma s I got mad They know that Some of staff treaded me very poorly and multiple friends died there literally doors away from my room They forced me to go inpatient after that and i begged them to send me to another hospital if i had to be on a closed ward everything was better than there But that was too complicated for them So yeah when i got discharged because they couldn t fix me i swore i wouldn t go back ever So they told me if i wanted to be admitted somewhere else i could wait six months Nice thanks Its always so funny they tell me that when i say i want to die and tell them alright fine i ll fk die than And actually attempt And then somehow they have the courage to say wow we were unpleasantly surprised and didn t see this coming LMFAO and THEN i am suddenly transported as soon as im physically ok to the first closed ward with watch Sorry for rhis long rant with bad english I just am so done I tried to tell them i was not ok I tried to ask for help two months ago and again two days ago The only thing bringing me some peace in my mind are self harm and my cat And i tried to hold on for my cat because she means everything to me and for everyone that loves me because i know damn well what its like to lose ppl to suicide But i can t I can t i just can t I can t go to school next year I can t go on a waiting list of six months and i can t go on this way My plan takes multiple days unfortunately and it started yesterday so i have to wait spend my time cuddling with my cat and self harming I doubt wether i should tell my best friend we have an agreement that if the other will end it we will say goodbye and not inform anyone until after I don t wanna lay the burden on her shoulders but otherwise I would ve give everything to have had a chance to say go the ppl i lost I would ve kept it a secret if it meant i could be on the phone with them until they passed I can t bare the idea of them having been so alone God that haunts me the most Knowing they were all alone when they died I don t know guess that s gonna be the last harsh decision to make,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

It s impossible for me to get along with people and I have a body that refuses to breakSo I haven t been officially diagnosed but it has been suggested by a couple psychologists that I could be high functioning autistic There was a time when I would just be walking down the street and someone would just randomly slap me or kick me in the balls or they d throw a knife or metal bar out the car window as I m walking Now it s just a matter of people want nothing to do with me and see me as nothing but a pile of shit Outside of a work place environment everyone avoid me even on foot path in the city people literally split the path to go around me At work they talk with me say they love me in what I assume is just friendly affection every now and again but come end off shit they run from me as if escaping a burning building The off chance people talk to me outside work it s someone on internet halfway across the world only to bitch about their issues and get advise and then fuck off till next time they need venting and advise I literally have no worth it seems In the last years I ve been hit by buses trucks and I stopped counting the amount of cars after most of the time the vehicles have been speeding and doing at least km h mph some of it has been my fault running across road but a lot of it has been people trying to run me over I have licence plates memorized because they have gone on the foot path to try and run me over or I have been hit by them at least times Worst part of all is my body is so resilient that I literally get up and walk away with minor scratches and bruising or nothing at all so police never believe me when I report it To top it all off my body won t let me commit suicide I can t cut or stab myself jumping off m high building ft my body instantly straightens and relaxes upon impact and rolls out against my wishes trying to drown myself by jumping into water I can t stand in my body all of a sudden knows how to swim but when I want to swim for fun I can t and drown I have been told its merely emotional disassociation and I may feel like I want to die but actually don t however that is not true at all there s nothing I want more then to die the only thing that brings a smile to my faces is the fantasies I have of all the ways I wish I could die however my body won t allow it everytime my life is in danger I lose all control and my body acts on its own as I watch and scream at my body that is absorbing impact instead of resisting or hand releases a knife against my wish as I m trying to stab it into my throat or temple,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

just at a loss So I m at a point where things in my life just seem to be way too ridiculous for me to make any sense of or control I am m and here s some backstory grew up well off but with a case of undiagnosed depression and one of those families that never owned up to just how dysfunctional it really was It was my senior year of high school when all the previously ignored shit finally hit the the proverbial fan though My father lost his job and my parents decided to split My family now just my mother me and two sisters went from living a living a comfortable lifestyle to just making ends meet We moved to a tiny house and my mom was forced to find a job to keep us afloat All throughout this process my depression and anxiety issues start coming to a head I would go to school and just have panic attacks and either just walk around the place aimlessly in a weird haze or skip school altogether to drink or do drugs Eventually I dropped out Ever since then things just got worse and worse I started getting into more serious drugs until I started using strong painkillers and heroin My mother kicked me out and I was forced to move in with my father who sort of lived with his friend My first night there he explains the reason for the divorce was that he explained to my mother that he was in fact a gay man and he couldn t go on living a lie I guess While it made sense and I WAS extremely sympathetic to his coming out I couldn t help but feel alienated and weirded out Also I never really had a great relationship with him in the first place He was never the typical dad and also had his bouts with alcoholism here and there and I honestly didn t really like him for that even in spite of viewing everything now through the lens of his coming out At this point I realized how depressed I was feeling really suicidal daily but I was able to curtail the self abusive thoughts through drugs and alcohol I just sort of did not give a fuck about anything anymore I guess I wasn t in school and couldn t hold down a job and this developed into tension between me my father and his friend Eventually we almost got into physical altercation so I peaced the fuck out of there and went from house to house living with my cousin and other relatives and eventually some girl I was sleeping with at the time One day my ex girlfriend got really concerned because of my depression and drug use and coerced me to check myself into the psych ward at a hospital I did I spend around a week there and they discharge me with an antidepressant perscription I continue to live with said girl whose family actually turns out to be really cool and supportive and things really start to improve for me mental health wise as I stay on the Zoloft I eventually land a job at a pizzeria so my mother decides it s cool if I come back home providing I pay rent I m psyched and things are pretty cool for a while I quit hard drugs and stop hanging out with wasteoids But my medication runs out after a month and I don t have health insurance cause we re poor now Anxiety comes back tenfold and I just cant take working at the stressful pizzeria anymore so I stop showing up I try to explain to my mother what s up with my depression and anxiety but she just doesnt get it and thinks I m a wimp She finally agrees to pay out of pocket for a psych appointment so I can get new perscriptions but does so grudgingly and always uses that to sort of hold over my head This was about a month ago My medication is about to run out again and I still cant find a new job Everyday my mother comes home from work pissed and apparently now I have until the second of November to give her rent money or she ll drop me off at the social services building She doesnt fuck around It s been months but I m starting to feel real self loathing again and I feel like the only option I really have is to just sorta check out or get into hard drugs again I realize that was a lot to read and yeah it does seem like the plot to a bad coming of age tale kind of thing or some shit but this is what s up for me right now I figured I d try to bounce this off of some complete strangers to see if there are any suggestions solutions to my bullshit other than self harm Anything in response is both unexpected and appreciated So yeah,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Irreversible problemIn general I ve had an alright life I ve got friends I m generally liked by those who take the time to get to know me I have a supportive mother and family I became successful in a career I wanted to pursue from just my own enthusiasm fincally alright off and I had a loving caring and stunningly beautiful girlfriend who I shared so much in common and wanted to spend my life with as did she Everything changed when my girlfriend took her life During our two year relationship she d been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder I tried to get her support and help and in ways she seemed to be getting better The problems certainly put a strain on our relationship and left me emotionally and mentally exhausted at times but I stuck by her because she was worth it Among the many reasons she may have taken her life I know she was very scared about me being away for a new contract as I d been gone for the weekdays and even with me trying to reassure her I believe her abandonment issues overwhelmed her Since it happened everything has just spiralled Her mother blamed me and started to spread lies about me resulting in people turning against me It s put immense strain on my relationship with my mother as she witnesses me lose my will to live I had to leave the job as I could no longer face it and lost all passion for the career I once enjoyed so much The main thing above all else is how I ve lost her and I can t fathom or face a life without her She was just too special too loving too beautiful and no one will ever live up to her I feel like I failed her by moving away and none of this would ve happened had I just stayed I m I ve spent most of my adult life single due to my crippling shyness and anxeity It was almost a mircale that a girl like her was interested in a guy like me and I feel in ways I blew it for not making her feel more special and taking her for granted It s been over half a year since it happened and I m just getting worse Even with therapy grief counselling medication and endless research I m not improving I won t meet another and even if somehow I did they would never compare I don t really want to die but again I can t face a reality without her I find myself spending more time now just getting ready to end it getting the confidence to do it I get no joy from anything I just cry and spend all day in bed Not even sure why posting this I guess it s just somewhere to vent,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"
