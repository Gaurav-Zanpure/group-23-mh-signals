Tables Turned When we go through the pain the anxiety the sadness the darkness the depression everything that is constantly pushing us back and trying to push us down one day the tables turn One day we get to the point where all the time energy effort sweat tears blood amp our entire soul is seen by the Universe and given to us fold Until that day keep pushing keep going its all worth it The times we are going through can be difficult sometimes to find the energy to push through the day to complete tasks and projects that have been created by us but then become a responsibility Something that helps me is knowing when I am feeling tired and wanting to give up I take a step back To reset I go outside and breathe in fresh air to forget about life for a brief moment and just be Everything that is being focused on right now is for something greater than we can even think of that we expect but the Universe already knows and thats all that matters to me Keep going I love you Drey lt https preview redd it db kie slcm jpg width amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp s c a b a a e c afaa dccdf c,medium,medium

Let me explain to you why suicide is the best thing ever for ANYBODYSuicide is awesome Because suicide by definition is the intentional taking of own s life You take your own life Your actions do it Nature doesn t kill you you don t die just randomly no you fucking do it Isn t that awesome I think it is because death is fucking great and your own actions cause it I love death And today death is going to become reality for me I m really depressed and i have anxiety but i haven t told anyone Because i just don t see the point in it really What good would that do me I get help and i kill myself some other time Because that s just the way my brain is So fuck it Reddit Let s go out with a bang shall we I had this eternal struggle for a very long time and i made up my mind And i m happy because it s going to be over soon Reddit But Reddit i need to ask you something first Do you want to watch it My suicide Because if you do then yeah i can livestream it I don t care I know some people find it fucked up and not cool but a lot of people want to see it right So i m down Reddit i m down amp x B I m going to kill myself in a isolated place so i don t know when people will find my body if ever even That s the way i prefer I don t want to hurt people that are close to me Okay that sounded wrong i know i m going to hurt them if i disappear but it s not going to much of a mind fuck like a suicide would be At least that s what i think Anyway Reddit if you want to see it tell me and i ll make a post before i go live okay,high,high

Lost all future prospects and have been on the edge for the past few days TLDR Title Hello all I ve come here mainly because I have nowhere else to go Some background I m a year old junior attending a Christian private school I ve been struggling with depression for a while but I managed to work through a lot of that and carry on with my life Now if this doesn t sound super terrible that s because it s not and honestly I have no idea why I m posting here when there are people with real problems but I m far enough there s no reason to stop now A few days ago I was caught sexting with a friend of mine by her extremely religious parents who then proceeded to tell my parents who are also fairly religious and it just went downhill from there It all looks really bad for me Even though we both participated I am seen as the main aggressor since I am the male and can be kicked out of the school that I have been attending almost my entire life Not only that but as she s a minor a few months younger than me which makes no sense but whatever I can be convicted as a sexual predator further ruining any prospects for college or anything afterwards as well I have no one to turn to My parents hate me for ruining my own and in turn their name and I only have one close friend who I normally bring this type of stuff to but she s the one I m currently banned from contacting I have no one I can trust or talk through this with and there haven t been too many moments in the past few days that I haven t been considering ending it out of horror at my actions and utter humiliation and if the rest of my grade around kids found out about this my only reason for hesitation would purely be the fact that I m a coward with no backbone repetitive ik but whatever I know that one of the reasons I m posting this is because I want to be convinced otherwise but I m so numb to just about everything at the moment that I would have absolutely no qualms with ending it I have no idea what to do There is no reason for me to keep going seeing as my entire life is now forfeit and I d rather get out without any more suffering on my part or anyone else s Also please ignore how pathetic this is,high,high

Just want to share these past couple days with you allEarly hours Thursday morning my nana attempted suicide She ODed on a mixture of prescription drugs and paracetamol My aunt checked on her a few hours later found her collapsed beside her bed she had been sick and was unconscious Eye bleeding from where she knocked her head on her beside table She had rosary beads and my grandads pocket watch in her hand Two ambulances arrived and took her away There was a carrier bag of empty medicine packets A bit of background My Nan has attempted this before she myself and many other members of my family have suffered varying levels of depression at different times for different reasons My Nan turns this year She was witty active creative and thoughtful She was diagnosed with terminal fibrosis of the lungs months ago and her quality of life declined rapidly more than we had realised The paramedics on a rd attempt managed to revive her and she was put into Critical Intensive Care Since then I ve witnessed the raw shock and emotion from my family members When only weeks ago I had considered suicide again I related to her so much but from a totally different perspective Her chances of survival were next to none primarily because her lungs were too weak but there was also brain damage from the minutes she was unresponsive in the ambulance I don t know why I m writing this out I don t exactly have a point but it s pushed me away from suicide for now I understand Nan truly I do She is still in hospital her lungs expected to give out some time tonight For the brief time she was conscious and able to get some words out to us she apologised As incredible the technology and the teams are that brought my Nan back for a brief amount of time I really believe that if somebody is mentally capable of choosing to end their life especially when faced with a terminal illness we should let them go I would ve done the same There s much more I can talk about more of my nans last words all the differing views of my family some want to cover up the fact there was a suicide attempt but that just adds to the stigma This discussion is necessary Whatever I m tired Self harming still but suicide has been pushed back for another time,high,high

Consideration and thoughtHey Reddit I don t know how to really start this for my first post but hopefully you will bear with me and I hopefully at some point I ll be able to share my thoughts and feelings and people can empathize with me I m pretty much going to be throwing out my thoughts and I may sound strange at times so please forgive me if that happens I am suicidal It s not a continuous thing where I think about it non stop but I do get the thoughts often Some might look at me and think that I d have a pretty decent life and that there s nothing wrong with it I have friends who love me a family that cares about me sometimes and I guess I couldn t really pinpoint why I am suicidal I have been to the doctor for help after years of self diagnosis with depression I was not in the state of being too proud to ask for help but I was worried about being criticized by my family members I d often think about suicide and ways I could do it My main thought processes are Hanging myself I can t tie knots so this isn t really viable for me Drowning I have a morbid fear of water Jumping from a great height I also have a fear of heights I have never talked to anyone about this before apart from my doctor It took me a LOT of courage to visit the doctor Like I said earlier it took me about years to actually ask for help I think the main problem for me if you can call it a problem is that I d want to commit suicide but I can t find it in me to take my own life People might think it s a good thing that I m still here but for me it is an never ending battle with myself Whenever I have these thoughts I also think of how people would react to me successfully committing suicide I can imagine that they would feel bad obviously I think it s another reason why I can t do it I can give a lot to my friends and I am a rather selfless person I love my friends more than I love myself and I would do anything to make the ones I love happy I d walk on hot coals or broken glass or I d run into moving traffic just so my friend would smile They definitely wouldn t smile if I ran into traffic and died but this is my problem I suppose I don t want to be here but there are a few things in the way The doctor put me on a month waiting lost for a counselor and I ve been prescribed anti depressants My mother doesn t want me to take them because she believes that I will become dependant on them and she thinks I will turn out like a zombie I also asked one of my uncles and he described depression as a difficult thing He said it s all about training your mind to be positive For me that is very difficult and I didn t even think of bringing suicide up to him In honesty I don t think it s fair to tell anyone that I m suicidal I m only here writing this in the hope that I will find some relief Maybe I will I think the one true relief for me is suicide When I went for help my family members reacted negatively There was no praise in finding help which is understandable seeing as most of the time family members do not understand depression and suicide etc Friends might but in my eyes family doesn t My brother said I was lying to the doctor about how I feel which isn t true If I was crying and sighing non stop and I breathed deeply left the house and went to the doctor for what I thought was an emergency I needed the help While I wouldn t say I truly recieved help it was a weight that was lifted to find that my illness was recognised I was diagnosed with major depression anxiety and seasonal affective disorder at the start of this month I guess I really don t have a point to this because I m not really asking for help directly but it is a little better for me knowing I can speak to a wider audience about how I feel Suicidal thoughts for me are still ongoing everyday I am very very scared though as to if I ll go through with it Thank you for reading if you have I appreciate it,high,high

I dont see things getting much betterClearly if I m posting here im not wanting to die In fact I really wish life could be better for me I just dont believe I will get better My issues come from a lot of trauma and I ve been in therapy for more than years I consistently do things to try to better my life I try to make healthier decisions I try to be a better person and I try to employ the fake it til you make it method of being happy not in a disingenuous way just trying to make good habits I have some good days I have some comfortable and quiet days I do not necessarily have happy days And more so than the former I have a lot of really hard moments and days I m tired of feeling haunted I m tired of the hauntings always coming back and always getting in the way I feel like I m doing everything I can maybe I m not i dont know But at what point is it just the rational decision to accept the reality of circumstance There are plenty of people trapped to cycles of mindsets and behaviors they cannot change or are almost incapable of changing On my best days I do not believe in much besides biology and chance Things have no meaning besides what you give them If I were capable of feeling safe and comfortable then I would be happy finding things that I have meaning in And i try to do this But I can t have the basic foundation of stability On my worst days I am convinced that the world or at least my own world is plagued with pain The one thing I can believe in is pain It is consistent and promised and not fake I cannot believe in anything else as genuinely as I can pain At what point is limiting the amount of pain I continue to endure or encounter the more rational decision rather than being a sitting duck waiting for the next trauma to come Or the next affirmation that I cannot trust myself nor others Or the next proof that there is no good around me I dont want to wait for those things My hauntings convince me those things are coming whether they are or not Which makes those things reality anyways I m tired of the moments where I feel completely despaired and fearful Not even entirely sure what my body and mind are dreading most of the time sometimes my mind just rationalizes that intense fear by creating paranoid thoughts And then I lose my sense of self and reality even more It s awful to have flashbacks and nightmares and then paranoia Its awful to believe everything can and will hurt me I m tired,high,high

"A couple of years ago, prior to being diagnosed-- I impulsively cheated on my husband. I still take accountability in my wrong doings even though I know it was a very manic, triggered impulse state in my borderline recovery. Since then, I've worked to change my life around completely. I work now, have created a life and goals for myself, and pay for therapy sessions out of pocket (bc my insurance doesn't work with this therapist and she's been integral in my recovery) and really DO the work daily to not let borderline rule me or my impulses anymore. I still feel them-- especially as I was taught from early ages to equate self worth with sexuality etc, but I work hard daily to be better. 
 
 I confessed everything to my husband a year and a half ago, and my marriage has really changed for the better. Before where we had no connection, we have finally been best friends now the last while. Each other's cheerleaders. Until today it was revealed to me he has been cheating on me with someone and has a whole relationship with them. He's had to live away for a few months, while I stay with our son and it just feels like such a slap in the face. I've done all of this work for myself yes, but my marriage too. ): I just feel so hurt. He did confess it all today and said it was ""just an eye for an eye.""
 
 Just feeling a bit defeated by the diagnosis today. That no matter how far you come, to some people they will still not measure it. That shouldn't matter for most, but for us it makes the difference in now feeling rock bottom.",medium,medium

Dear HumanityIt s funny how life works it really is the roll of the dice Some people live brilliant successful lives by climbing their way to the top Some people live lives of heartache and pain they then turn that into an art and become successful too Some people are just ordinary and blessed with a family or maybe just a single parent and they thrive and overcome the odds Some people are born with terminal illness mental illness disabilities and whatever else and they all succeed Then you got people like me people who tried everything they could and fought their way with everything they had only to not be enough Now here I am on this random reddit page venting this all out because I see no outcome other than death after this Treat people well treat people with respect treat those who are unfortunate and encourage them with love Give them a boost anyway you can and just realize that we all are just one single species at the end of the day The planet doesn t belong to us we belong to the planet If you have a significant other out your arm around them and say how much you love them because you never know what tomorrow will bring Make your significant other some food breakfast lunch and or dinner whatever you feel like you can do buy them flowers take them on dates make them smile and laugh help them feel motivated like they can do anything Most of all let them know you will always be there I was once so ignorant and arrogant that I thought I could help everyone Because I hate it when people are hurt and I tried to make it my number one priority to help others in anyway that I could because I thought we needed more love in this world I took on a responsibility that was impossible and I should have seen it coming but alas I allowed my own ignorance and arrogance to blind me That is my own fault and I take ownership for such foolishness Now here I am recovering from a botched surgery that should have killed me and to be frank I wish it did When I finally got better and tried to start again with my monthly disability natural disasters struck my hometown leaving many out of a home car everything While I was lucky in that regard the day after the disasters happened my car was stolen probably by someone who was desperate So here it is me years old tried to make something happen in my life now it has all failed Therefore I am officially a failure and I want this life to end I am now just figuring out a way how I wish you all well and just do your best in a world filled with hate hostility lies deceit and cruelty,medium,high

So I ve been exercising in I think the most unhealthy I can So at just the start no I don t use drugs or steroids or have anorexia I m talking mentally so with that outta the way let s get on with it P S info for the story I m competitive year and I have a long distance girlfriend I ve been with for almost months and I use way too many commas so please forgive me So I m British and my school is right next to the Thames this means we rowing as a sport Throughout year and I always wanted to row so when year rolled around and I was finally the minimum age I could be I jumped right into it I was never an athletic kid hell no I wasn t fat I was unpopular not stand out and to put it simply below average in grades physically and probably in terms of mental health too I was very unpopular being the first kid to hit puberty at to so I was taller than others but still physically very unfit Now one thing that got me into rowing was that fact I was tall At I was approaching foot and fast One thing they don t tell you about ergo machines is that height matters A LOT I instantly got one of the best scores in the year and then it began I was launched from the background right into the spotlight I was suddenly madly competitive and mildly popular and I wanted to be the best So I was Throughout all of year nine I ground my body as hard as I could to have the body I wanted Our year was also the year where the Thames was overflowing our dock quite a bit we had about sessions in the entire year on the water the rest on the machines My body was exhausted but I wasn t eventually nearing the end of the year I managed to pull a split on metres This was a BIG deal I d beat my goal I beat metres in less than seconds to be exact My first ever time took seconds over a fifth higher I was the top of the leaderboard all day every day and my confidence showed it I felt like a king Then Covid happened Immediately I had a problem my gym wouldn t let me in even with no lockdown cause I m under and I had no ergo so we had to get one A concept was preferred as it s industry standard Cut weeks into the future and I ve nearly lost quid of my dad s money to a scam of a concept but i have the new RW NordickTrack Rowing Machine delivered by the lovely Amazon Good Great I was back But then Covid stayed my motivation slipped and I became lazy I was a tragedy if you ever saw one I was doing barely anything and my body was paying for it I was slipping from day to day of online school feeling awful and having my body go down in quality all the while But I got on with it I got back into it and I pushed my body past my limit until I got back So I feel great going back I grin to my friends as I mount the ergo and prepare to brake another of my records at the front of the pack in my arena I felt unstoppable My score was below average pitiful considering how i was and way below what I wanted expected and needed to be in the top boat By now the sport consumed me but rejected me I was getting mediocre scores and everyone else was soaring Cut about a month and I m kicked from top boat Just realized writing this forgot to say I was a year when I came back and we had a new coach she hates me She kicks me from top boat and I m crushed shaking from disappointment in myself and suddenly I m pushed back into the background I didn t matter once again I was paired with the people who wouldn t focus but in boats with people never having rowed before Wanna know the worst bit I could see the top boat speeding away from us any time I looked to my right we were finally on the river and this is how it was Now we re in lockdown again and I m determined I can t let that happen again or so I think right before I get on the ergo once more and feel a painful rash spread across my whole body So it turns out for a few months I ve had a condition where whenever my blood gets to hot or something that s when it effects me worst I break out into a rash I was struggling once more thinking it was just hayfever I struggled through each session it got worse and worse I now have medication an antihistamine to be exact fexofenadine hydrochloride to stop it Great back to it So my school is private and most of the kids have mansions and one guy I know has a gym the size of most of my house so I m at a disadvantage competitively and I ve been doing this for one and a half years when these people have been swimming competitively in their pools for most of their lives But I got too it and I m getting better with my body and I m getting better scores until there it is my name My name in gold I got the fastest score for a kilometre race in the year Remember how I said Concept s are industry standard Well that means my coach who once again dislikes me had to change my scores to be accurate To do this I sent her my average watts produced per metres a measurement which adds with to my score in a concept conversion to per metres and I did it in the km this doesn t add up if you check since it s just an average watt count but the timer didn t lie I d done it This did not matter A split second in a race does And so does my split score As I said before I beat in seconds My coach added seconds to every split I did from my home ergo and my name was wiped from the leaderboard no matter what the watt count said I was pushed forced back down I went from the best score to one of the worst Now seconds is a LOT of time and that s for each metres so instead of my original score I was forced to put up with a score of seconds slower than the original So now what do I know I can t beat anything at home now I can simply train my body for when I go back to be best again The seconds thing was weeks ago about As I mentioned I have a girlfriend she s incredible we don t see each other much and we mostly text and she was getting concerned about the strain I ve been putting on my body But I ve been insecure about everything for too long I can t handle not getting back up there I need it I crave it I was born to row I know it So I ve been doing the worst thing I can I ve lied to her Multiple times I say I m going to bed but I stay up going as hard as I physically can no longer bound by my condition Even as I write this it s AM and she thought I went to sleep at I need help I can t stop I can t keep doing this to her I feel terrible My body is sore and aching and I can t lie to her anymore it s awful I need suggestions on what to do I can t put her through me complaining more and more I can t stay down in rowing and I need to get back up I m ready to row again

I thought I was better but I m not I recently graduated college and was discharged from DBT therapy after successfully completing about months of treatment I am officially cured of borderline personality disorder and my depression had decreased to mild However I recently about a month ago started a new job at a winery just planning on making some money while I prepare for law school because I m taking a year off I thought I was doing better but every day when I get up to go to work I hope to god that on my minute commute i ll get head on by another car and either die or end up in the hospital where I don t have to deal with angry clients anymore I have two bosses and theyre like jekyll and hyde if hyde were just incredibly passive aggressive I m so angry because my complaints about my job are so petty but I ve been shaking like trembling from fear and stress at work and having multiple panic attacks a day I take klonopin for anxiety but it s stopped working since I m literally always anxious my mood stabilizer isn t helping either I m supposed to talk to my psychiatrist today or tomorrow but honestly all I want to do is die painlessly quickly and get out of everyone s hair The only reason I didn t do that a very long time ago is that there s never been a right time I want to have everything in order before I do it and i don t want to hurt my loved ones but this is unbearable I can t even complain about my job because people just say everyone has terrible bosses and like ok maybe they do but i feel like all the progress i made in therapy is gone and i m living in this weird fake constructed world that my work tries to create for our clients everything is contradictory and it s too much I can t do this anymore I m leaving for a week after tuesday so i guess i will ahve a little space but I don t even know if I want to give two weeks notice since I m scared I m going to start hurting myself again if I stay Also when I had a medication mishap I had a mental breakdown in front of my boss and my coworkers and i ve been embarrassed ever since I never want to show weakness but there s nowhere I can go to cry in peace on my breaks I never want to go back I never want to leave my bed I want to redacted because i just read the rules,high,high

Sometimes I think I am on the brink of insanitySometimes I think I am on the brink of insanity Yes I got my ADHD diagnosis so I know that it really isn t my fault but no the neurotypical people around me don t understand I have been feeling extremely miserable and struggling with some assignments at college I think I have asked my peers for homework help too many times and some are deliberately shunning me I sometimes think that ADHD is a fucking joke where people see you as crying wolf all the time due to the fucking nature of this disorder I ve only been diagnosed within two months and my parents shamed me into thinking that I have not been trying hard enough They never see the aspects where I am slowly improving and it seems like they are expecting some miracle where I will suddenly become perfect To them it is always my fucking fault My country doesn t have cognitive behavioral therapy so I have been seeking help from a therapist at my uni I didn t really click with her On the suggestion of my psychiatrist I asked for a therapist change Only one person is in charge of the administration there and she ignored When I told my parents this it is my fucking fault again My parents really distrust my psychiatrist and think that she lied about how the public healthcare system does not accept ADHD patients and now I don t know if I can trust my doc as well My parents also think that I am deliberately lying about my problems so that she feels sorry for me I feel like my very existence is a fucking joke and because of this I can never be happy ADHD is a fucking joke and people see us as crying wolf I feel like I am on the brink of insanity and there have been numerous moments where I empathise with spree killers as I can understand why they went insane I won t do that myself guns are illegal here but I can feel the pain of forever being seen as not good enough and as an outsider,high,high

I realised no one can look after me F I ve had mental health problems inherited and years of abuse my entire life which culminated in the current diagnoses of bipolar GAD PTSD Body Dysmorphia OCD and ADD I also already have psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia which used to be really bad when I was obese kg and my ex husband buried his head in the sand and ignored my health problems and I would be in bed alone for hours unable to walk and he would leave me a glass of water and some biscuits I left him and found someone who seemed the opposite M and I moved across the world for him and his kids and became a step mum and lost kg so now I m a trophy too My mental health is being managed well but in the last months I ve found I ve got cervical cancer for the second time my bowel isn t working so I need surgery and then finally in the last weeks I got leg paralysis and they ve ruled out physical causes and are leaving MS on the table on top of everything else I have an amazing job I am an international keynote speaker popular on social media etc friends all over have world but I never let any of them know how dark I m feeling I was sort of coping but adding Covid and lockdown has shown that I genuinely don t have anyone to care for me if I am diagnosed with MS My partner who was amazing picks and chooses when I m worth looking after depending on his mood I m currently stuck in bed no food trying not to drink anything because my leg paralysis means limiting walking around having a text argument where I m begging him to come talk to me but he refuses to believe it s that bad and I should walk to the living room I said to my mother that if I got MS I would move back to England and live with her and although she was jokey she made is it clear I couldn t But my partner has shown that he clearly can t keep his emotions in check and look after me He talks the talk when we are in a good place but today has shown how proud and petty he is and the detrimental impact on my physical and mental health as a result So here I am with medications wondering if anything is worth striving for anymore It s a yr track of uncertainty and relapses for MS diagnosis all whilst I m dealing with the cervical cancer and dead bowel both of which need surgery but it s been delayed for Covid I have been so close to ending my life countless times since early childhood but today just felt like a day of accidental goodbyes and clarity over the lack of control of my future I ve had my emotional tearful breakdown but now I feel calm and ready Does anyone get to that clarity How do I get back to reality because surely this can t be the end,high,high

"head tingling constantly idk what to do iâ€™ve been going through head tingling a lot in the past few months on my left side always and itâ€™s at the top of my head down to my ear but recently itâ€™s been constant i havenâ€™t had a day where my head wasnâ€™t tingling so bad it feels like iâ€™m being prickled or something crawling all over my skin and in my ear now of course iâ€™m going through head pain and eye pain everytime i look around my eye has this null pain plus may i add i also been dealing with vertigo ever since my first vertigo attack last year my whole life been constant unbalanced and constant swaying over and over i havenâ€™t had a moments peace and i should get an mri iâ€™m to scared too because i donâ€™t want to know if i have a brain tumor 
 
 everyone keeps telling me itâ€™s just anxiety if i had a brain tumor it would be this symptom or that symptom that i donâ€™t have i know i have severe anxiety but recently iâ€™ve been the most relaxed iâ€™ve been in a while and now i canâ€™t even think because my head is tingling my ear is aching my body feels like itâ€™s on a constant boat ride 247 thatâ€™s just never ending i kind of just accepted this is my life now i guess because this is insane133â€™ i donâ€™t even know how to relieve any of this oh on top of all of this my hands havenâ€™t felt any relief in a year it still feels like my hands are tight and numb i kind of just learned to live with it but it fucks with my writing and typing because i canâ€™t feel my hand 
 
 iâ€™ve been checked for diabetes last year came back negative i got my ear and throat checked my doctor said my results came back fine and he recommended me to get an mri bc he thinks i have a brain problem

I feel helpless watching myself destroy my futureHi SW I m a student at university I should be happy with where I am and the subject I m studying but I m not I ve been having problems with education and my social life as far as I can remember It is only now that these problems have intensified to the extent where my life has become a disorganized mess I have been to several councilors in high school to help keep myself up to date with homework and coursework Since I ve started university I have fallen behind on my work and social life My dorm room was covered with post it notes and reminders on my walls I was forgetting to complete and hand in coursework I ve been receiving letters from my tutors who are concerned about my progress At the end of last term it was too much and I had a breakdown I went to see my doctor about the problems i ve been having he was not much help so he is referring me to a psychiatrist I m now on a six month waiting list I have not discussed any of my problems with my parents as I m afraid of disappointing them They will be furious at me for destroying an opportunity to a good career and life I feel like this is beyond my control now I ve wasted a lot on my cost of living and tuition fees I lost a lot of friends I have made by being selfish and neglecting them I feel the only way forward is to end my own life By the time I get to see a psychiatrist it will be too late and even if i do get help sooner I doubt it will change much about myself This is my third time re writing this so i hope I got my message across clearly I m sorry for not being more specific about everything If I try explain things I start rambling and don t get a point across Thank you for taking the time to read this,high,high

"direct switch from escitalopram lexapro to sertraline zoloft hi guys
 i know there a few posts about this topic but i couldnâ€™t find any recent ones
 i have today took the plunge and done a direct switch from 20mg escitalopram lexapro to 50mg sertraline zoloft having been on the former for around 4 months i thought it was helping initially but my depressive symptoms have returned with a vengeance and i didnâ€™t see the point of treading water with a medication thatâ€™s not helping
 anyway iâ€™ve done a lot of research regarding switching these meds and it seems to be a very individual thing as to how people react to the change
 just wondered if people could share their experiences of doing a direct switch with these meds

"I just find myself so useless. I have been dealing with social anxiety, others may find it easy to go out to work, but not for me. it is really stressful whenever I think about going out to work. Even if I have a job, I find it meaningless too, to wake up at 7am for a 9am job, reaches home at 7pm, only a few hours left to do my stuff and then sleeping early cos you got to get up early next day again, that goes on for the rest of my life which I do not like it at all. I tried to sell some stuff online to support myself financially, but that is not working out. Now that our breadwinner has passed on, we are left with a huge debt for housing loan, and also suffering from monthly utilities bills. Family and relatives only tell me to go out to work so that I can have an income to support the family. Others look down on me. Since I am so useless, I am slowly losing my will to live. I just want to leave and go to a happier world. Slowly losing my will to survive, do I have anymore reasons to live on?",medium,medium

A Story the quest for love has taken it s tollYou have heard the expression it s better to have loved and loss than never to have loved at all Lies what folk often forget is the psychological and emotional toll that multiple failed relationships has on people each one chips away at your mental health and adds baggage that stays with you for most of your life I have no idea what day it is today but I start each morning with tears flooding my face and a crippling desire to not exist anymore I d like to drop my life story here on the offhand that someone somewhere reads this and can relate with me on some level throwaway for good measure brace yourself for a really long read location UK NO Early life I was lucky enough that my family could afford to place me in a posh private school for pretentious wizards Unfortunately this education was wasted on me as my depression unwillingly began when I was thirteen years old yet I could not comprehend what depression was at this age I was also addicted to the video game world of warcraft WoW Both the cloudyness of being down and the constant thought of when can I get home for my fix left me void of motivation to partake in education University life I had zero social skills due to days I had racked up in WoW but somehow managed to land a girl from a club let s call her X X was half British and half Norwegian she was shy family orientated and equally inexperienced in life We did nothing but watch TV the rest of this chapter is boring let s fast forward UK worklife Through the aid of a lecturer I scored a job working for a top US ISP in a data centre hours north where I lived the city was dirty and work gave me crippling anxiety When you re anxious depressed your judgement is clouded colors are less vivid and all food tastes the same I constantly made elementary mistakes which only made the anxiety and depression worse I never focused in school and the stimulation from gaming destroyed my attention span Four years past and although she never vocalize these words X really wanted to start a family X was also an engineer and quite intelligent We had spontaneous intercourse one night and later I worried it could lead to a pregnancy she reassured me it was impossible on her current cycle I return after a twelve hour night shift to discover a positive pregnancy test prominently left on the bathroom counter I was twenty one years old with no life experience shocked and dismayed did I even love X or did I simply love the security a relationship brings I push for an abortion and she reluctantly agrees I know I m an asshole Things get weird nothing is familiar anymore I m tired of my job hate the dirty city and pose the idea to X that we move to Norway she s fluent I m lost what could go wrong Grand adventure I got a job for another US tech company before leaving UK we travel to Oslo with our possessions and Gandalf the dog and ferry and drive our way across UK up Denmark and across to Norway I did not integrate well mostly my fault and the fact we moved based on a semi ultimatum X is unemployed for months We had been dating six years at this point I had an emerald engagement ring X finally gets a programmer job but cheats on me with the guy twice her age who mentored her I spiral hard new country confused lost heartbroken they speak great English in Norway but I didn t know any Norwegian and this blew my anxiety and depression up I drink for a week straight I got into bitcoin and crypto mining as a hobby before it exploded then I discovered this could be used to buy narcotics off the darkweb Twenty six years old and I d never touched a cigarette or drugs other than alcohol I buy benzodiazepines off the darknet This opened the floodgates as it temporarily cured my issues and my quest was to try the rest V Before online dating turned to shit I met V half Norwegian half American lots of fun I kept up the drug routine and expanded my desk draw with a variety of disassociatives psychadelics depressants and stimulants I wanted to move to California with V as our vacations there were eye opening I got denied after roughly job applications serendipitously I got a targeted email from a renowned tech company doing R amp D work in the video conferencing market dream company and dream job depression and anxiety prevail V and I still had fun but I went crazy and occasionally psychotic I pushed V away and we split and then realised I was back to square X this prompted my first suicide attempt using a litre of sambuca mg diazapam and a gram of mdma in the hopes my organs would cook whilst I was in a benzo sleep state I took the pills and put the bottle to my head I passed out before I could reach for the mdma baggy I woke up in hospital ICU hours later When I woke the first thing I tried to do is strangle myself with the beeping machines power cable staff intervened and I was placed in a psych ward for a while The dream The job was perfect I should be happy I was under qualifyied but these people enjoy the stories and bullshit I spew in interviews Two years pass nothing changes I m lonely abuse takes over Usual life is pointless angle I ve tested all the drugs at this point except opioids I order heroin with the sole intention of permanent overdose No toleranse I snort there entire bag I sink into my bed no further I sank through the ground and down into the earth s crust It felt horrible A part of me didn t want to die just sleep forever I call my Swedish friend and explain the overdose he calls and ambulance Hell I wake up in hospital very psychotic everyone is trying to kill me the walls are caving in and extremely colorful smoke floods the room the tv gives reports of a male rapist and the possible suspect is me I feel the hospital is in on the jig and see them trying to take DNA from me blood in an attempt to frame me for this non existed crime why would Norwegian news be in English One night I escape I run far but I don t know where I am or how to navigate the hospital security track me down and escort me back to my bed The next day a tall in stature ripped private security guard appears at my door Yes Finally protection from the nurses with no faces and the snipers outside that I ve been ducking all week Wrong so so wrong I later found out he was there to stop me escaping and to protect the staff from me I cried in broad daylight when I figured this out Doctors told me they ran MRI s in the extended duration I was unconscious to check for brain activity no dignity left at this point Fast forward back to the psych ward familiar faces Realization I was staying in this country simply for the job yet I was still insanely depressed lonely and no ambition to integrate with the knowledge of the fact that I m here only because of X I met another girl called Y we bonded over drugs unfortunately this is what my life has become she was nice but attraction faded we lived together for six months on and off work was getting more intense I was making more mistakes due to the usual three things Y had a hash smoking habit we smoked a lot but I couldn t handle the pressure anymore and I decide to move back to England Familiar land My tech job and incredible manager let me teleconference work from home for a bit whilst I landed on my feet Problem is I never landed I stayed with my mom for a bit she has bipolar and schizophrenia This is after my parents divorce my dad was an esteemed doctor saw the signs tried his best but couldn t help as she did not believe there was a problem but everyone else is looking at the fucking huge elephant in the room I m talking about the mental health stigma not my mom she s only mildly obese She is money obsessed she divorced my dad for cash She knew I had an engineer job and wanted me to fund renovations on the house she got from the cash split in the divorce I did not oblige and called her irrational over some remarks she made Her response was well atleast I haven t been in as many psych wards as you I got mad and flipped a table in the hall nothing got damaged heated reaction She called the police on me for not paying her lifestyle or making noise Anyway her property her rules the really friendly and pretty cool police obliged and drove me to my dad at a secret location due to being afraid of what my mom is capable of I don t want to go down this road but my father lives a lot of secrecy and I could write a book on the psychology that binds his half of the family together New beginnings I rush and find rented accommodation Things seem good I meet a new girl Z Now Z is incredibly rude but I was attracted to her dark and dirty side Relationship moves fast she drunkenly says I love you multiple times but then forgets it happened at the two week mark I meet her entire family we argued over some trivial things she also lived minutes from my home she broke it off after a pitiful six weeks I make new guy friends and the next months go well However depression kicks in full drive I can t focus function I just want sleep or constant sleep I order a bunch of oxy and heroin and this is attempt four shan t speak of three as it was really dumb I nodded out and awake god knows how many hours later which is really confusing and at the time more depressing I can t even off myself how depressing is that I was out for a very long period of time and developed a blood clot or some issue requiring ultrasounds and blood thinners on my leg The next two months were painful Goodbye Tech last October I just couldn t handle the stress anxiety guilt of underperforming so on and so forth So I yolo resigned and went travelling I went through Japan and I went to one of my best friends who lives in Washington US I had an incredible time my friend in US understands me on all levels but our time came to and end I m back home the past three months have been spent laying in my bed in my room abusing myself with zero ambition to even

Most days my brain is just silently AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIt s like this indescribable emotional pain mixed with an intense almost overwhelming desire for life to end all resulting in a feeling as if there s a corner of my brain just screaming endlessly TL DR Shoutout to everyone here trying to get on with life with a brain that wants to die Posting here because I can t act anymore I can t pretend that everything is okay I ve gained kg in a week from eating rubbish which is super yuck but I also don t care because my brain has been swamped by intense suicidal ideation and if I m not sufficiently distracted the thoughts about suicide come back in like BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM just drowning out everything else I think about self harming a lot I mean not only suicide but other forms of physical pain But then I remember I ve got way too many scars already and additional scars and a high pain tolerance doesn t change anything I don t have a good reason to want to die There s no major crisis The relationship breakdown was over months ago and I m mostly over that I have enough money for everything I essentially need Sure I ll probably need several more major operations because genetics suck and I ll definitely need a double mastectomy at some point because cancer risk but that s not it either It s not even the fact that I have about three friends and the last time I hung out with a friend was in February because at the moment people are too exhausting for me to want to have any interaction with I don t want anything to do with anyone right now I can t pretend to not be depressed when I m around other people anymore It takes all of my energy to pretend to be normal and smile and laugh at work and I know I don t do a very good job at that as it is It s not really any of that I just don t care anymore About any of it Any of life I am amazed I have been together enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth and pay bills and work days a week Do look pale and run down as shit though Going through the motions I guess while my brain is screaming I want to die all the while It s gotten to the point where I m thinking about suicide all day every day I suspect it s the general anaesthetic I had from a colonoscopy in May sending me off the deep end into post operative depression but also the general state of the world Now I know if I stopped eating crap and did more exercise and got more sunshine and made more of an effort to be social I d probably feel better But it also gets to a point where you cannot bring yourself to do any of that because just getting dressed and maintaining basic personal hygiene is a mammoth achievement So I am going to my GP on Monday to ask to go back on antidepressants It might be a complete waste of time and money as it has been in the past but I can t help hoping that this time will be different that this time maybe we ll try a different drug that might actually give me the capacity to overcome the intrusive suicidal thoughts and do the exercise and the things I know I need to do for wellbeing Also going to see the psychologist on Monday It s been difficult to get an appointment a because it s bloody expensive and b because a huge chunk of the general population are under huge stresses so she s super busy and hard to get into I m hoping I have the money to continue to see her because she s the best psychologist I have ever seen I haven t kept it up because of financial stress and my mental health has suffered as a result But I think this time I should be able to stick with it for a while It s been hard because the depression has screwed with my cognitive function and sleep again too I can t concentrate for more than seconds I m agitated and drowning in anxiety all the time I go to sleep late and wake up early whether I like it or not I can t remember anything and everything takes me ten times longer to process or understand than usual and I constantly feel as dumb as a rock I wasn t entirely honest with my doctor last time I went because I didn t want to be on antidepressants again and I sure as hell didn t want to run the risk of being put in a mental hospital again But at the moment it s gotten to the point where I just don t care about anything anymore so might as well be totally upfront I think I m too lazy to actually kill myself Having been there and tried that more than once getting it right takes a lot of planning and organising and logistics I just don t have the energy for Especially because were I to go through with one of the plans for suicide I have I don t want to leave all my stuff just around for my family to deal with I d need to sort out my belongings and affairs etc etc etc and make sure I had enough money to cover any potential funeral or medical expenses if I fucked it up And that s the nub of it Human beings are both incredibly resilient and incredibly fragile creatures I think what keeps me going at times like these is that I know if I failed suicide where I was left half brain dead and still aware that that would be a fate far worse than this My life could be x worse than it currently is no doubt But knowing that doesn t change that incessant suicidal impulse blamming it s way across my brain I just wanted to put this out there because I needed to tell someone how I feel right now with completely honesty And maybe someone else will resonate with how I feel right now and it might help them feel they re not alone,high,high

I also suffer from anger management issues and without medicine, I can’t control myself and we fight a lot. I feel really lonely here, he works 24/7, but I prefer that than being with him honestly.

"So, a little background. I'm a 23 year old male with a BS in physics and applied math. So I'm somewhat intelligent (this is relevant). About a month ago, I saw an article on reddit (can't remember the sub) about a doctor who was helping people with an issue that seemed similar to what I'm experiencing. The best way that I can describe it with how the article described it, is that you come to a conclusion on something that *could* happen (or start thinking about *why* something happened in the past the way it did), and you basically go on a logic train to hell, where you follow a bunch of illogical conclusions that build up into a horribly unrealistic scenario. However, if someone asks about how you got to the scenario, they can see your logic that brought you to that last conclusion because they can follow your logic even though the logic is unrealistic. The problem is I can't for the life of me think of what the disease is called.
 
 On the topic of the intelligence part, the article talked about the doctor having to use techniques for this one patient because he was intelligent and the normal treatment wouldn't really work with him. Basically he could see past simple logic problems, but not advanced ones. I think this is where I'm at right now.

I can t stop crying I don t know what to do So everything in life seems to be piling up on me I have a full course load of senior year classes an entire stack of companies that I need to submit job applications to very soon exams and projects coming up two clubs that I m already committed to doing things for and I missed a lot of school last week for a family funeral I ve also been sick for over a week now and I can t sleep more than hours a night even with medicine The thought of food makes me feel sick so I am barely eating The thing that really is hurting me now though is that yesterday I went over to see the guy I was dating already upset and crying and hoping for any kind of comfort only to have him tell me that he didn t want me We were both going to the same party last night and he told me that I shouldn t be around because he thought he had maybe other women he could get with After he spent the night grinding on some girl he met two weeks ago he told me that he wanted to date her and proceeded to tell me everything that is wrong with me both physically and personality wise Looking back now I should have seen something coming over the last week even though we haven t had any fights or anything I m posting this here because when I came back to my apartment last night I spent a long time thinking about how easy it would be to OD with all the alcohol and drugs I have here I do think I probably have some form of depression based on my past history although it s never been diagnosed or treated Fortunately I ve never been tempted to think about this before but this is the closest I ve ever been and the whole idea scares me I just can t see a way to take care of my pile of work and I can t even begin to describe how lonely I am There s no other way to make it all go away and waiting it out hurts too much I don t have a car so it s hard for me to get out of the area and take my mind off things even if I did have time to do so I also don t have a whole lot of friends here most of the people I did know graduated and are already drifting away I called two friends last night but neither of them live remotely close and it didn t seem to help although they did everything they could for me The thing I need most in the world right now is someone to hold me while I cry on them or even just a big hug would probably do wonders I just feel so alone What do I do,high,high

"I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13, it was from a school councillor. Later things were being a lil simple but then I lost my best friend. So it’s weird, she left me and my coping mechanism was to assume that she died. I feel it’s real. I’ve severe anxiety, like all physical symptoms. I’ve them all, just that I don’t sweat. Anxiety attacks, panic attacks are a normal part of my life since past two years.
 I’ve lost so many people now that I’m not weak but broken now. All were family (no breakup).
 I’m afraid I’ve BPD, I’ve all 8/9 symptoms. I don’t wanna self diagnos but I feel it’s real.
 I feel everything just so intense that can’t even discribe.
 Sometimes I feel I’m making mental illness, I’m fake is all I feel when no symptoms around.
 I’ve chest pain almost all day in breaks, sometimes mild, sometimes strong. It’s just so pathetic. I feel as a complete fake and unknown person. Can’t recognise what are my choices and who am I?
 Can someone tell me do I’ve BPD or am I faking?
 Anxiety and Depression are real but sometimes I think that’s also fake.
 Can’t go for professional help as I’m 17 rn and there are things so, I’ll go for professional help when I’ll be 18 and get a college admission.
 Please helps people.
 I’ve told about ya symptoms to many people but half them mocked me and made fun and others just showed sympathy which I hated. I feel also, just so alone.

"a sick relative is causing me severe stress iâ€™m hoping i can post this anonymously so no one close to me can find it but i really donâ€™t know what else to do as everyone i talk to seems to tell me the same old crap that doesnâ€™t comfort me at all for context i am autistic and i donâ€™t like change in routine or bad things happening i also suffered a major trauma from a surgery i had 15 years ago and have gotten ptsd from it this also seems to happen whenever someone close to me is sick varying from mild to severe like this 
 
 so my mom has an infection she got it checked out and has been in the hospital ever since kept getting told it was nothing then got a text thursday night 8pm saying she was scheduled for surgery on it of course this sent me into overdrive and i was screaming down the phone to her saying to come home she had the doctor on the phone to me who said it was gonna be sepsis and there may be a need for amputation well of course this has led to me having panic attacks and everything i got sent home from work 
 i went to drop a few things off friday thinking that i was able to pick her up at dinner time just like i was told on the phone that was the next lie i was also refused entry to the room and had my things snatched from me and taken due to a panic attack i was told sheâ€™d come home at 8pm i was not corrected when i asked if amputation was needed or even necessary so this led to more worry on the way home 
 8pm arrives and i text momma to see if she wanted collecting and i get told no freaking no after i was told to my face to return at 8pm this was friday night and iâ€™m sure they knew exactly what they was doing because it escalates they say she can go home saturday 
 saturday i ask once again what time will momma be coming home and i get told once again midday i was at pride and thought cool theyâ€™ll be home when iâ€™m home oh no i get yet another text saying theyâ€™re not allowed to do any releases until monday despite saying that the infection had gone and stuff so i waited until monday monday rolls around and i ask once again what time i go into work trying to be normal i get a text at work telling me that the infection had never gone and wasnâ€™t allowed back for the 5th time itâ€™s now tuesday and i have been given the same crap i get every day a constant cycle of yes in the morning no in the evening i feel like iâ€™m not being told everything 
 
 this has caused me so much stress itâ€™s unreal first the nurses told my mom i was making things up and denied they said anything about sepsis or whatever they also havenâ€™t made me feel at ease at all lying to momma about going home then an hour later saying no for 5 days me and mom have gotten into arguments and then hours later iâ€™ll be on the phone sobbing and apologising like crazy only to be lied to again or the doctor not doing a release which starts the cycle again 
 
 i havenâ€™t eaten since saturday iâ€™ve not left the house in 2 days iâ€™m signed off sick from work for a week i canâ€™t stop crying my chest is so tight it hurts i have heart palpitations iâ€™m vomiting every time i try and put food in my mouth i have daily nosebleeds i have a constant sense of doom and if i donâ€™t get a text atleast once a day i automatically assume that something bad has happened 
 
 i just want to know is this panic all from past trauma i seem to freak out if anyone close to me has to be in the hospital for a period and itâ€™s to the point where iâ€™m getting sick over it constantly begging the person to come back home where it is â€œsafe from things like surgery and icuâ€ itâ€™s always the worst case that i fear and i even fear death everyone says itâ€™s too much tv but i canâ€™t even watch anything about medical stuff as it induces the same stress i googled about it being a severe fear or a trauma response but honestly i donâ€™t know i just want to know why i was lied to but no one will tell me",medium,medium

"Howdy! I have not posted in this subreddit before so I hope my post meets the submission guidelines. 
 
 I am interested in the topic of mental illness and criminality. Today I read an article about an alleged terrorist who had been under surveillance by the FBI for an extended period. During this time, undercovers posed as love interests and terrorist sympathizers to coax a man who they identified as mentally ill into committing crimes. 
 
 Reference: http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2016/03/text_messages_reveal_undercove.html
 
 I do not defend the actions of people who willfully commit acts of violence, but it seems morally and ethically unsound to identify someone as mentally ill then coax them into criminal acts, especially involving terrorism.

Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk I talked about football with this random guy I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide I sat at the bar almost falling off the stool and it really hit me this time I really could kill myself tonight I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying Was it peaceful was it scary was it just somewhere in between What it is is the feeling that beyond a shadow of a doubt you would not feel the consequences of suicide because you will be dead All of my friends My family If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them but in reality I won t exist it won t effect me it will be nothing I silently decided ok I think tonight is the night I stood up turned to the guy I was talking to smiled and told him to have a great night He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ok you too and I left My first thought was are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to And immediately I thought yes Who cares It s all symbolic horse shit that won t mean anything after I m dead It s the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach and that s never been me so why should I care I left the bar and just started walking I didn t know where I was going but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars all with a major a plan a path I ve never really envied them or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet for better or for worse Last night though I couldn t help but find the humor in it Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone that I went to school somewhere that I had an identity outside of being nobody It made me think about how there s probably plenty of people I see actively contemplating their death that just blend in like me It made me think even if it were just for a second to reconsider what I aimed to do that night I thought about it for a second I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning Then I remembered I already made my choice I didn t sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now I intended to do what I ve known needed to be done since I was I kept walking and walking and walking I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health I thought about how now in retrospect I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson It was about AM at this point I finally reached a highway It wasn t like an interstate more like a lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it I d see these wheelers come buy at MPH Upon seeing this I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things I thought about it for a second What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident What if it killed other people but not me I couldn t bring myself to do it for that reason I continued walking down the highway Even though I wasn t gonna jump in front of one of these cars everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road I walked until I saw a park I don t know what possessed me but I just entered the park with no intention I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it I leaned over the side and vomited then I passed out I woke up hours later with an awful headache Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it and I let it slip away I don t know when I ll ever be able to capture it again Today I woke back up in purgatory where I ll remain Life is endless suffering,high,high

i want to preempt thisi ll be brief because frankly i don t care anymore within a few days few hours or something like that the absolute love of my life is going to tell me that she feels nothing for me anymore she woke up one day and everything was different in her mind including me her loving mate we never fought we got along perfectly we matched in all the right places we were deeply and madly in love we opened up new worlds for one another it made life worth living and it s going to end i didn t do anything to cause it but that doesn t matter in the end so the question is what can i do to avoid killing myself i don t like the idea of antidepressants my pointless pride prevents me from getting a therapist i ve been through an awful depression before and i almost killed myself there this one is already several magnitudes worse and it hasn t even really started yet i don t know what to do,high,high

I feel unbearably lonelyHello well I ve been depressed since sophomore year October of I ve attempted suicide at least three times and was admitted to a psych institute February of I started feeling better but around the start of junior year I started to feel horrible again also my bf went back out with his ex girlfriend so that contributed to the depression I was raped in October and my parents found out so I got even sadder My boyfriend and I got back together which made things better for a little while But he never seems to care about whenever I m feeling sad or suicidal Whenever he s sad I do whatever I can to help But if I m crying or feeling hopeless he brushes it off So most of the time I just keep my feelings to myself Anyway it s on a daily basis that I find myself on the ground bawling nearly hyperventilating from crying so much I have literally no one to talk to about how I feel I don t cut anymore but I hit myself to feel some sort of relief My parents won t put me on antidepressants and my therapist doesn t help I m constantly fantasizing about my suicide I find comfort in planning it out in my head and I m also comforted by the fact that I could kill myself whenever I feel the need to I know I m young I know I have life ahead of me but I can t take daily breakdowns much longer It s becoming unbearable and I just feel physically exhausted from living I m not even completely sure why I posted here I guess because I used to find comfort in posting here old account and I even made a friend once I m sorry for all of the text I just needed a way to clear my head,high,high

Irreversible problemIn general I ve had an alright life I ve got friends I m generally liked by those who take the time to get to know me I have a supportive mother and family I became successful in a career I wanted to pursue from just my own enthusiasm fincally alright off and I had a loving caring and stunningly beautiful girlfriend who I shared so much in common and wanted to spend my life with as did she Everything changed when my girlfriend took her life During our two year relationship she d been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder I tried to get her support and help and in ways she seemed to be getting better The problems certainly put a strain on our relationship and left me emotionally and mentally exhausted at times but I stuck by her because she was worth it Among the many reasons she may have taken her life I know she was very scared about me being away for a new contract as I d been gone for the weekdays and even with me trying to reassure her I believe her abandonment issues overwhelmed her Since it happened everything has just spiralled Her mother blamed me and started to spread lies about me resulting in people turning against me It s put immense strain on my relationship with my mother as she witnesses me lose my will to live I had to leave the job as I could no longer face it and lost all passion for the career I once enjoyed so much The main thing above all else is how I ve lost her and I can t fathom or face a life without her She was just too special too loving too beautiful and no one will ever live up to her I feel like I failed her by moving away and none of this would ve happened had I just stayed I m I ve spent most of my adult life single due to my crippling shyness and anxeity It was almost a mircale that a girl like her was interested in a guy like me and I feel in ways I blew it for not making her feel more special and taking her for granted It s been over half a year since it happened and I m just getting worse Even with therapy grief counselling medication and endless research I m not improving I won t meet another and even if somehow I did they would never compare I don t really want to die but again I can t face a reality without her I find myself spending more time now just getting ready to end it getting the confidence to do it I get no joy from anything I just cry and spend all day in bed Not even sure why posting this I guess it s just somewhere to vent,high,high

On the edgeI have been emotionally and physically abused by my alcoholic father every month since I was He always attacks me whenever he s drunk and vents his anger out on me My parents argue all the time whenever he drinks but I m always the main victim every time I can t help but feel like my family allows him to abuse me He doesn t think of me as his son and apparently he never did He always yells You re not my son at me My mom the only person I have that can protect me never does anything serious and with that I mean she might say something at the time But the following day they all act like nothing happens with each other he ll ignore my entire existence and when he s drunk again he ll attack me Its the same loop that has continued for so many years he drinks at least half the month every month He kicked my eye one time when i was which damaged my vision on my right eye He broke my hand and wrist when I was One time when I was he grabbed me by my hair and started punching me all over my body while trying to shield my face I accidentally hit his teeth with my elbow I m a lot taller than he is and knocked of his teeth out he has bad teeth due to years of alcohol and smoking There are so many more occurrences of him being physically aggressive towards me but I decided to keep it short Ultimately I cannot help that the rest of my family members my older sister and mom allow him to abuse me I m sick and tired of this I don t feel like I belong here if they loved me they wouldn t let this happen would they A whole decade of this drained everything out of me My mom won t let me defend myself claiming someone should never hit their father etc Traditions etc And all that bullshit She says stuff like A child should never hit their father even if they re father is trying to kill him My family is Asian and where they re from they have all these weird folklore made by sheep herders and illiterate government officials I haven t received help from anyone and the situation continues as I am writing this The fact that we re in lockdown due to a covid outbreak in my city doesn t help He has no issues with any other family members just me I want to beat him up to a pulp I am physically able to but its my mom that stops me I don t want to break her heart but at the same time I can t take this anymore Now every time I see his face I can t help to desire to beat him up to a bloody pulp and kicking him out to the streets I can t take it anymore one of us has to go and I feel like I should be the one to go as they defend that alcoholic piece of shit,high,high

The loneliness during lockdown has now really gotten to me Ever since the lockdown I ve been gradually getting more and more detached from reality all the games I play have now become boring and having no contact with my friends really doesn t help As of writing my sleep schedule has started to make me wake up at night and sleep through the entire day I always drift off at around AM and then wake up at PM at the earliest and latest As a result my routine I m trying to get to is ripped apart because of it I ve been administered around two sleeping pills every night multiple times but my body quickly adapts to it and puts up a tolerance to the sleeping pills after one or two nights when given a dosage and one of my siblings are convinced I m suffering from Insomnia I m convinced it s getting worse by each passing night I can barely be bothered to get myself up from bed now due to lack of motivation I m not good with arts writing or music anymore and the games I once enjoyed playing I ve now grown more distant with each passing day losing more motivation by each one I have a feeling that I might lose so much motivation that one day when I go to sleep and wake up I ll just go back to sleep again And then the cycle will repeat itself School is not helping either I can t cope with the online work given especially since I only have one computer that is not used for playing games As a result I ve given that up too I just can t cope with this lockdown any longer and that s coming from a borderline introvert TL DR Lockdown sucks signed by an introvert,medium,medium

here s my debate for why violent video games reduce violence IRL I m having a debate competition and the motion is this house believes that violent video games lead to violent acts in young audiences so o figured this would be of some help against the banvideogames subreddit it s not too good rn most of the time we commit violent acts because we re angry or frustrated by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world say for example DOOM you know the drill we all like BFG division you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth I just didn t feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing that s why I think cyberbullying isn t a problem if you know how to treat is properly my own opinion you guys might know something I don t can someone please improve on this and post it elsewhere I m not a good writer I just started out the debate,low,low

Losing hair and on the brinkHi SW I don t really know how to start this post I m and my hairline is receding it s not super bad yet but eventually it will be It s completely changing who I am and tonight I planned on ODing however I flushed the pills so I guess I m holding on for a bit longer I know considering killing yourself over hair is just plain retartar but to me it s so much more than that in the sense that I carry so much of my self identity in my looks The depressing part to me is going from someone who my friends relied on to be the positive one and the one who they could lean on and stuff I genuinely enjoy helping my friends through their hardships and giving direction then seeing them flourish The other aspect is going from someone who would get complimented on my looks or called an when I was younger to not I ve gained some weight as my emotional binging from hairloss got to me but I ve been going to the gym for the past months to fix that only kg to go woo I ve also been meditating daily to help myself alongside reading powerful self improvement books like habits of highly effective people how to Win friends and Influence people think and grow rich etc The really dumb part to me is I ve helped friends get past stuff like this and now I m letting it destroy me I really am I can t practice the advice I preach it seems I ve made so many efforts like those listed above to try just be a better person mentally and physically but idk nothing seems to work though I guess I m still here so something is working Now I know friends don t care about the hair on my head but women do but that s another story but I feel like I can t be their supportive and directive friend if I m not happy with myself My self esteem my confidence and my will to care is at an all time low It sucks I broke up with my girlfriend a month ago things were not good for either of us and now the worse my hair gets the worse I m getting I feel I m starting medication to try regrow my hair finasteride I m aware the risks but jesus I never thought something so little such as hair would make me very highly consider necking myself For other guys out there going through hairloss I hope you handle it much better than I I really believe it s not the biggest deal in the world it sucks yeah sure but it s not a deal breaker and other people don t care Hypocritical coming from me yup I realise I guess I m posting this also to try relieve some feelings I want to tell my best friend how I feel but he dismisses my hairloss as really something to not care about that I just can t adopt so I ve stopped talking to him about my feelings Hope you re all OK and persevere through your hardships Thanks for the support,high,high

Can someone be too broken I spent many years being severely abused and it still affects me Can someone be too abused to run a normal life I tend to mess things up due to being re traumatized and turning into something I m not The most recent incident is with my girlfriend She is everything I ve ever wanted but after getting a message from an abuser inquering why I haven t killed myself yet I misplaced my anger I turned into someone she didn t know I wasn t who she fell in love with I messed it all up in the space of a week and she doesn t know how much more she can take She is everything to me I can t lose her I m trying to fix it I m getting on meds seeing a therapist multiple times a week and proving that wasn t who I really but I don t know if it will work Every time I hug her I have trouble letting go because I feel like she will leave me I kiss her so hard hoping she will feel my love and reciprocate I know she loves me but I m too much I can t say it to her but I don t want a future if she isn t in it She is what made all the other pain worth it I recognize that is too much for one person to deal with so I try not to let that across to her If we break up it will only prove I m too broken I can t go on without her and even if i could I truly don t want to I already know what to do when the day comes It won t be her fault It s my fault It s all the other pain that I ve dealt with finally reaching me,medium,high

Hello I don t want to be dramatic in this post it s not in my nature Instead I m going to talk out my plans why I feel this way and maybe have someone to talk to about it I m not looking to be diagnosed or be a patient to a therapist But just talk When I was years old my parents had their third child I was their first and I am their big brother They annoyed me and I annoyed them still do But they re my siblings and I love them A few months after my third sibling was born I started having these thoughts Terrible thoughts of ending my life at this very young age I had no friends I had no life I didn t do well in school and my parents always fought while I took care of my siblings I am now and my parents have long been divorced my dad literally proposed to his girlfriend just days ago She said yes and things are great for them and my siblings In fact I have three more little rugrats joining the family as my mom is currently pregnant with her boyfriend s third child I am still the oldest When I was years old i wanted to die But I didn t I stayed alive to protect my siblings However I said to myself that when I turn on that very day in September when my body turns years old I will end it all That is in years and I don t think I can do it I am not happy with my life I have a dead end job I didn t graduate high school I have friends which are more or less just people I hang out with and I have no concept of what my future contains But I don t want to die Yet I want to end my life on my birthday at PM on an age that is satisfactory for me Like or So far seems to be the winning number But the only thing that could possibly stop me from this is one thing A girl The brown eyed black haired girl I met in middle school She had a huge crush on me and when I asked her to dance at our graduation dance from middle school to high school she cried She even said at one point that she would marry me if we could I was too much in my own head to conceive this Hey a girl ACTUALLY likes me Cool I should date her was my thought process And while what we did throughout months of high school wasn t as much dating and more of acting like close friends I loved it But then I ruined my life by breaking up with her I just don t like her that way anymore I said When really the drama in my family with my parents divorce and my internal conflict of wanting to die was the answer I want to try again with the brown eyed girl as adults We still speak on a bi daily basis and it s to the point where she actually said I m her best friend I ve dreamed of proposing to her at Disney world after the fireworks have ended and watching her cry as she tried to mutter the words yes This is her perfect proposal A perfect proposal for a perfect wife to be But that is just a fairy tale The girl ignores me when I try to ask her for coffee or makes up some excuse as to why she can t go I want to understand and say well maybe she s telling the truth but in reality I know she flat out doesn t want to Well that s it I m resisting the urge to look over and reword the mess I spilled out over my keyboard but these are my naked thoughts I am most likely going to die in September of Anyone wanna chat,high,high

"Two days ago I posted something so cute about hitting 76 days clean and now I’m all fucked up. Idk what happened but my bf (LDR) said that he wanted to shorten my trip length from a week to just a weekend. This changed comes after about a week of him acting really weird, he says he’s got a concussion but he worked and drank too much making it worse. I was ok with that but I wish he told me before when he was acting weird so I knew. 
 
 He wasn’t talking to me or texting me as much as he used to saying he needs to minimize phone time or he just doesn’t use his phone when he’s out or with fam or friends but he’s with them 24/7!! The phone is literally how we communicate and how this relationship works!! I felt abandoned like he just didn’t care bc he refused to compromise, we went from talking ~1-2 hr on the phone each day and like 500???? texts to like ~30 min on the phone and 100 texts a day. 
 
 I really hurt. I felt alone. He has so much time with his friends and family in person and I don’t ever get to see him, and he still wants to shorten our trip that is literally still a week and a half away bc of his concussion when he literally does the same stuff we’d be doing maybe even more when I came up. He says he needs to feel independent but I’m literally 1000 miles away and am just ducking asking for 8% of ur time every day. 
 
 He knew I had BPD from the start but I have genuinely been able to control it better than ever before until tonight. I just feel like he’s making excuses to not talk to me and not let me come up anymore, but why? You know what my mind jumps to… I believe him when he says he had a concussion but I really just feel like he changed into a different person. He went from being the perfect person everyone loved him promising me everything caring and understanding and now he acts like I’m fucking disgusting and he hates me. 
 
 Tonight he promised me that I would have a chance to call and talk to him for a while, but then he called late and said he was tired and needed to go to sleep to rest up instead but then I texted him a little later and he texted back and he had just been chilling with his brother who he sees CONSTANTLY. And then called his friend instead of talking to me after promising me!! He always sees and talks to these people he lives so close to them! He literally just acts like he fucking hates me and I’ve kept it together for a fucking week and a half and I really just wanted to fuckinf see him for enough time. 
 
 I called him over and over and he blocked me and made his cousin block me and I just SH. Fuck it. Im so sick and tired of everything. Ok goodnight.",medium,medium

I m only years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long I m only only according to what people say years old and even though I wouldn t say I feel old exactly I m always thinking about our finite youth about ageing and our mortality I can t get it out of my head A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they re and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes as a year old with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes I m inevitably miserable in these pictures I see people I like admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises I m extremely scared of ageing you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me I m scared of regrets I m scared of ending up a nobody I m scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally I can t stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future I feel so much guilt when I m not efficient in what I m doing I feel so bad about myself my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty I hate myself for being too weak I really REALLY want this thing but I m so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can t pull through I want it so much that I want to cry It s more like a necessity than a mere desire The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating but having to do the work exhausts me emotionally I know at least one of the reasons why this happens meaning perhaps there are others but I m too embarrassed to tell anyone let alone publicly The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown with difficulty I partially told her my dream why I want it and why it s so important to me and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful It s not a crime or anything like that but it s something I feel is ridiculous and laughable something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am or have become One of my fears is having to commit suicide in the future between and years from now due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt I know I won t find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don t achieve my dream at least partially or if I don t achieve it in the time period I need to This is because my goal heavily depends on my age and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that My goal is along the lines of enjoy your young years doing things that years olds are Time itself is part of the specifications of my goal year olds or late year olds hanging out with early year olds is weird and unacceptable and I wouldn t feel part of the group either I want to hang out with year olds AS a year old but right now I can t I ve already wasted so much time isolating myself for years in my room with my computer not hanging out with people my age not gaining experiences not making memories but now what I want is something slightly different And being so ambitious or demanding sometimes makes me feel bad too Perhaps I m just a spoiled kid who hasn t grown up yet and learned of life Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable make peace with a life without this delusional grandeur dream of mine and live peacefully where I am I know progress can t be accelerated so much I do know it but I so wish it could you don t know much this pains me Life is so painful ageing is so painful your face changing and getting more year old looking is so painful I want to stay this age forever hang out with people my age all over the world celebrate with them suffer with them talk with them know of their dreams and fears learn about their subcultures be part of the group etc That last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want but yea as you see it s kind of stupid,medium,high

Will Pedophilia Happen To Be Normalized In the Future Pedophilia is not something new we all have been sickened or rather even angered by the very existence of it However in the recent past weeks a large number of social media accounts news articles and even memes have been discussing the very topic of the so called MAPS self identified maps aka pedophiles and how they are trying to normalize themselves by trying to get along with LGBtQ communities and even going as far as creating a flag to represent themselves Personally as a person who is extremely critical to topics of pedophilia and rape I was sickened and was worried In a recent talk with one of my friends about these topics we saw how people of LGBTQ communities were oppressed and were often hated and harassed by the general public and how it can still be seen in our older generation such as our grandparents and even our peers often labeling them as unnatural I was told about how just like in the past the people who hated LGBTQ communities are now considered conservative and parochial one day we might be too be seen like this but in this case it would be due to our disagreement with the very presence of pedophiles Countless underaged children are being abused and over sexualize for the sake of entertainment and fame by their parents and guardians and it has provided with a means of media for these pedophiles and you can virtually find child porn in literally any hentai Japanese pornographic art labeled as loli available at one click away Will in the future after common interaction of people about such sensitive topics make them numb and result in pedophilia to become destigmatized and be a thing of the future and we have to stay quiet about it I as a person is genuinely scared and angered with the very possibility and the helplessness I feel Please let me know what you think tl dr Will pedophilia become common and legalized and we will be known as the boomers of the future generations,medium,medium

"I am someone who has older parents than most people, my Dad is 44 years older than me and my Mum is 40 years older than me, I am in my mid teens.They have had heated arguments years ago, and they used to happen very occasionally. If they were a few years younger they would have got divorced, I am sure of it. There is no doubt in my mind that they do not love each other, or at least not anymore. Over really simple things they just yell at each other constantly, and recently its happened for four days straight, very long arguments.I absolutely hate it. It makes me cry away to my room and shut the door tight and put on headphones so I do not hear a word of what they are saying. I want nothing more than for them to stay together and not spilt up, for the sake of the family. If they divorce I do not know what side to take, but I know them well enough to tell that they will make me choose one.I am well aware that divorced parents is a very common thing. I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other, but clearly I was far from right. I recently have felt the urge to step in myself and just tell them both to shut up and get along, and have even considered buying flowers for my Mum and telling her it was my Dad so that they would hopefully calm down or something. It sucks, it really does. I just want them to like each other again. Hearing your parents fights everyday is just the worst.",medium,low

What the fuck did I just drink I was at a private party people I knew everyone there We bought some beers bottle of wiskey brandy and some energy drinks Later in the night we ran out of drinks and my friend s gf suggested she can bring out a bit of homemade stuff that her mom makes from her basement We agreed and she brought something that she claimed had alchohol It was like drinking fire but realy easy to down nice flavour and I didn t even need to drink something like cola to down it more easily Got me fucked up in few mins Realy strong clean alchohol high Me and my gf were the only ones who drank it she did shot and I did Next day I had visual audio and sensory halucionations on the bottomn corners of my FOV I saw realy detailed smoke every time I exhaled and when I closed my eyes I could hear my gf breathing in my face and even saying something just like in that moment when we drank this stuff I thought it was just me and didn t tell anyone but later I saw on my gf s insta story that she had absolutely same things going on smoke everywhere and she kept feeling my breath on her face I am realy weirded out Has anyone heared of a halucionations from alchohol We both were on alchohol nicotine caffeine and sleep deprived for h when this happened but real weird that we had the same effects Even today I can barely see a small haze on my FOV when I look for it What the fuck,low,medium

My therapist cut me off and it s got me suicidalI was seeing her pretty consistently this whole year and I ve been doing very intense work on my trauma However I had a habit of not showing up to sessions sometimes due to my depression This whole year I was going consistently and it s helped a lot In the past three weeks I did not show up because my depression was going off the rails and I had no energy I was attempting to reach her the past few days to set up an appointment and she finally got back to me telling me that she s going to have to stop seeing me due to my inconsistency I m really crushed and just broken down because of this My suicidal thoughts and ideations have been increasing in intensity the past three months but now I would say I m at a in terms of wanting to end it I realized that I should ve honored my appointments but I just feel so damn worthless now that even my therapist cuts me off Sorry,high,high

I can t do this anymoreI can t do this anymore I apologize in advance for the long post It started in my freshman year of college I had to drop out because I couldn t adjust to being at a major university not making friends and dealing with college level work I had a mental breakdown and had to see a therapist and physiatrist I was put on Zoloft and another medicine I can t remember That was December of for the first few months of I was a shut in I didn t do anything but stay in bed I found my dads gun but I was too scared to do anything with it I was scared it would misfire and hurt me and not kill me Eventually I began to interact more with friend that were home they didn t go off to school they stayed at community college and then planned on going to university I began to hang with them like old times during high school and got confidence in myself again I started working out on a regular basis again and felt good Throughout the summer of I was making friends and partying staying out late and not taking the medicine prescribed to me because I felt good without it I was smoking weed heavily and ended up losing my virginity while high to a girl I didn t even know on some random day This started a whole downward slope My car began to have issues because I was hanging out with a lot of girls I was considered a fuckboy and the one girl that I had gotten my first kiss from wouldn t date me because of that reason and because her dad is racist I began owing people money and couldn t pay them back because I lost my job I was high one day while my friends were playing basketball and decided to take my friends keys and drive to get something to eat without telling him I posted a girls nudes in our friend group message which led to me being kicked out While all of this was happening I was being recruited to the navy I had stopped smoking to join but I was losing a lot of friends My parents caught me smoking and sent me to a mental hospital It was around the time Mac Miller died Late I was still feeling good because I had something to look forward to joining the navy But soon the thoughts of depression came back after failed hookup attempts with girls I have to this day never had a actual girlfriend I joined the navy in early and made it to the last few weeks of boot camp Where then I failed the fitness test by not keeping my pace running I was sent back in training Which meant I had to do another weeks on top of the I had already been there This took a toll on me I became delusional and because of unfortunate circumstances on the base I was sent to another group The group was for health reasons related to a person who died and they wanted all the people with this condition to stay there until cleared to return All this group did was complain which bothered me even more I had a breakdown and was sent to a physiatrist to be separated from the navy I was still delusional and thought I was going to be in the navy I ended up getting sent to the mental hospital where I spent months before going home When I came home it was the summer of I saw a new physiatrist and it took me a few weeks to realize I wasn t going back to the navy When I realized that I began to spiral I began to constantly eat fast food I stopped working out I got fired after months at my job Throughout I ve gained a lot of weight my hair has began to thin and fall out I ve began to think about suicide I just have had enough I don t have the ability to feel better I have no friends no relationship to look to,high,high

am I the cause of my own demise Never posted on here before and I m not sure why I feel the urge to now I used to cut myself all the time in my head I did it for attention I wanted people to notice and ask me if I was okay so I could say that I wasn t and they safely tuck me away in a hospital for crazies and the doctors would spend months trying unsuccessfully to break through my emptiness The reality was that I was so scared of people seeing my cuts that I hid them the best I could despite having hundreds at any one time my family had no idea until I flipped out at school I was sitting in some stupid class I think we had a relief teacher it was a class where you could sit and talk with your friends and do nothing and the teacher wandered around doing sweet fuck all I don t know why but I grabbed a Stanley knife and sliced into my arm multiple times I remember it stinging so bad because there were so many lighter cuts underneath them I laughed I felt like I had something to prove A boy saw the blood and told the teacher she came over and I said he was lying but she wouldn t leave me alone so I pulled up my jumper sleeve and screamed at her to fuck off as I ran out I don t remember what happened next but my parents were told about it and I d left the school grounds The school councillor found me and for some reason I agreed to go with him to hospital He took me to be evaluated by a child shrink I barely said a word and I didn t look at him once I felt like I was in a trance the air around me felt so cold and heavy It was decided that I was perfectly sane and didn t need any sort of help what so ever The councillor took me home and my parents asked to see my cuts before never mentioning it ever again So anyway I continued to lead a destructive lifestyle most weekends were spent wiping myself out with a bottle of straight bourbon or vodka I hung out at local music gigs with my friends many of them much much older than myself I did things to the extreme because it made me popular not always in a good way I went out of my way to stand up for my behaviour so if someone in our extended friends circle thought I was a dick I d push and push until their close friends liked me and they d eventually give in and treat me nicely too Meanwhile I was a straight A student my parents worked a lot they didn t pay much attention to my schooling my grades weren t bad so they didn t give it a second thought In fact they saw me as being responsible I often babysat my little sisters one of them from when she was only a few months old I wouldn t abandon them or throw parties or anything but I did play horrible mind games with them and they d never tell because I d scared them into believing that was worse than whatever I d tricked them into thinking had happened was happening All of this stuff it was selfish I wanted to be the rebellious renegade cool kid but my parents and to a point my teachers were fed this bullshit goody two shoes image that they fell for This is how I got away with never doing my hometown handing in essays late wearing incorrect uniform everyday never doing exams never paying attention spending most of my time in the classroom yelling and laughing and making excuses Looking back I can honestly say that I am amazed at how much shit I got away with and that I finished school I found comfort in typing to a select few male friends for hours upon hours I often developed crushes on them but they never went much further than sex i was young and they were often in their early s One guy in particular sticks in my head not sexually or anything we never even went there back then in fact he broke his hand after punching a tree at his birthday party because he felt so bad that I was so attached to him at the time So that was my first real broken heart our friendship was awkward for a while and then I moved away and we have barely spoke since As a teenager I threw massive tantrums but I didnt realise the extent of them until the last few years when I discovered that I have black outs where I am in an uncontrollable rage I remember my parents holding me down at to check for track marks on my arms I must have been pretty psychotic for them to accuse me of being a junkie Teen angst I assumed but years on my episodes have only gotten worse This is already a stupidly long story I don t even tell this to my shrink so I ll summarise the rest quickly my family moved several hours away when I was in my second last year of school I hated my new school I felt so stupid and lost and uncomfortable I got pregnant had a secret abortion and never forgave myself I moved back and lived in a granny flat with one of my sisters Finished school but things just went ever the same I d discovered drugs Pills and speed My school friends didn t understand I moved back to the city near my parents The guy I got pregnant to had hung around and I was living with him until I realised I had only stayed with him because I was a mess after the baby thing he got abusive when I left him not wanting my parents to judge me or seem weak I kept living with my ex filing in my weekends with raves and a rebound guy One thing that did impact my life at this point was ghb considered a dirty scum drug I had a big crazy image to build to ensure I was popular in this new scene it was easy I had nothing to live for I hated myself for what I d done and the more I partied the less I had to stop and deal with the consequences I ended up in an ambulance times in weeks I passed out and woke up in some random guys bed with him fucking me I ran away and went back to the club I met a guy that loved going out too but knew I needed help so he wouldn t let me out of the house no matter how much I kicked and screamed We went out for a year but we were bad for each other we substituted ghb with speed and were still taking ghb when we could I spent destructive months after he left me in pieces My friends saw the tantrums one night male friends tried to stop me from hurting myself but I am stupidly strong in these rages and I managed to smash my head into the concrete several times until they let me go and then I ran and ran and don t remember the rest Ghb was ruining me again I met a guy from the rave scene I didn t think I was ready to leave my ex in the past but I decided to give it a chance So glad I did best thing that ever happened to me We moved in together after only a few weeks and years on were engaged I don t want to disclose the finger details in this time but I will say that whilst I m a better person we still give in to temptations just as often and I still have anger issues but until recently I hadn t wanted to hurt myself like I do right now My sister died a short time ago Overdose But on opiates It s not real to me it confuses me I can t make sense of it I don t want to deal with it I was diagnosed with ADHD anxiety disorders including mild OCD about a year ago Since my sister died my OCD is my way of coping things that used to be funny but necessary to me now physically hurt if I don t do them or if I do them wrong I can t help but think that my childhood desire to have people feel sorry for me paved the way to becoming that person Sometimes I wonder if it s just all in my head if I don t completely believe that I m sick how will I ever help myself When I get angry I often black out my partner tells me what happened each time I ve tried to jump out of his car at high speeds on a freeway drank bleach tried to grab a gun off a police officer hit my head so many times it s not funny taken pills blah blah right now it all seems like a good idea I feel so selfish It makes me feel worse,high,high
Anyone planning suicide in the long term future I m a depressed F who is considering suicide but not soon but within maybe years Why do I want to kill myself It s kind of a long story But the main reasons are a combination Lack of Economic Stability Health Problems Family along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life Economic Growing up was hard and I ve had to overcome a lot of adversity lower income household mother dying at a young age being a queer person of color strict parents depression etc like a lot of people here I m in college currently but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major college just seems very oppressive I know it makes me sound like an entitled first world millenial My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school not allowing me to choose a different school or even CC for a few years I had relatively good grades in high school I knew from the moment I was on campus that I hated it lack of diversity and friendship my health was negatively impacted I didn t have a good sense of direction or idea for a major career and never felt inspired I thought about transferring but didn t have the resources or finances first generation college student so I stuck it out though I was depressed I did well academically but since my major department is kinda shitty applied math I m worried that I won t get a good paying job unlike engineering students Like had I known earlier I would have just majored in that instead I will leave college next year with about K in loans Family Generally I strongly dislike my family life My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house as fast as they could My mom died at a young age and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming self sufficient my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife unemployed and kids even though he s pretty old and should be focusing on retirement I haven t come out as queer yet but worry that my family will disown me because of it not super religous but super conservative strict and family oriented My parents are also immigrants so we don t have tons of wealthy family here Health I have a lot of chronic probably genetically caused health diseases since I was young When I was young and in my mid teens I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive After my mom died my dad didn t bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists anymore my health has decreased It s hard at college too because I don t have a car and I didn t always have health insurance to be able to see anyone So my health continues to decrease These aren t life threatening health issues but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self conscious So because of all this I find it hard to justify continuing life I am kind of a nihilist and definitely an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife I don t want to kill myself yet but in years when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide planning once I m in the real world I ve seen many psychologists over the years but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable and condescending even It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first generation college student background with severly limited family support chronic health issues and student loans to be economically secure in like even years And it s hard to see my straight white male friends from more accepting and upper middle class families succeed in life when it s a constant struggle for me And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery what s the point Why suffer and struggle so much in life if I don t really see a reason too Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed with me and is truly planning suicide in the future I m also fine with talking to people about my choices and or expanding on the reasons above though I doubt people can change my mind TL DR Want to wait years before committing suicide Basically I personally see life worth living if I m economically secure have supportive family and friends and am generally healthy However for a multitude of complex reasons all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me I am also a nihilist atheist and don t see a point to life other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living,high,high
Therapist told me not to call anymoreSo it s been years and counting of continually worsening depression I finally started seeing a therapist I really like and feel like I work well with about months ago I d say it took about two before I really felt like things clicked in and I wasn t so intimidated by the professional environment I am not at all the type who easily shares with others out of a combo of crippling shyness realizing others don t really know what to do say care etc so I basically have always been alone in my struggles I have an emotionally abusive mother and while my dad and I are on fine terms we re not super close I don t really have any friends to vent to as not many really know I have issues and regardless as mentioned previously they never know what to do or say and can t babysit me a year old Anyways after a few months my therapist said I could start calling her I felt so guilty every time I did because I hated the idea of being a burden and forcing her to take work home with her as who likes that I knew I was possibly overdoing it admittedly I was only doing it maybe a third of the times I ve felt super suicidal over the last few months but unfortunately I feel quite suicidal very often with this event surely worsening that Anyways today at our session she gave me her business card and said this is the best number to reach me on Like First of all I really hated how passive aggressive that was I would have MUCH preferred her telling me that I was calling too much and us discussing that Secondly there is no way anyone could ever believe that her office number is her best number as she s only in her office days so there would be no way to get in touch past pm when she leaves or on a weekend or the one day a week she starts in the afternoon Anyways now I feel super awkward and uncomfortable I knew this had to be coming but at the same time prayed it wouldn t and also really hated the way this happened as I would have preferred a confrontation This really made me panic because I honest to god have no one to talk to EVER in dire moments and honestly just worsened suicidal thoughts And now I feel like a huge step back has been taken in my comfort level as previously mentioned I do not open up well at all and I feel like this has just set me back on that exponentially harder as now I feel more like I am sitting in a job interview meeting with a teacher or employer etc than a therapy session In fact this really has made me never ever want to call her again on any phone number or use email to do anything but discuss scheduling matters I have a session tomorrow and honestly just want to cancel the one I have on Monday which is the first time I ve ever not wanted to go to therapy I just feel like I got punched in the stomach or something Anyways anyone have any input thoughts advice Thanks,high,high

How do I go about dealing with poor mental healthThis is going to be a long post so if you read all the way through thank you The past two years I have been struggling with anxiety depression and bouts of suicidal ideation I was doing okay this past semester but these last few days have been really rough on my mental health and I planned out a suicide attempt which made me realize I desperately need help The suicide hotlines are useless and I was just denied online therapy I am a low income student so I of course do not have insurance and because I m only taking credits this semester I don t qualify for my schools mental health services I just don t know what to do I can t afford any sort of therapy I ve checked every nearby therapist and they re all over even with sliding fee scales and I don t qualify for insurance I just feel lost I don t have any family or friends to fall back on and this particular year has been awful on me Do any of you have some advice I m trying to get into law enforcement after graduation not policing so I m scared of being diagnosed with any sort of mental illness But at the same time I feel that therapy and possibly medication would really help However I don t even know where to start on that since I can t even pay for the initial appointment Any advice would be helpful Sorry for the rant and thank you for reading,high,high

So why continue Ever since middle school I have wanted to commit suicide It s not gotten better I am in my final stretch of school at college I just want to end it My logic has shifted from I hate myself because I am an awful person who doesn t deserve to live to what s the point of living I figured it out I am just like everyone else We all have problems and we all have things we are good at and bad at That s fine There s no reason why I should hate myself But I do Every action I take causes me more sadness then happiness And the happiness I do attain never lasts more than a few days I ve tried medication and it makes everything worse Much worse What s the point of continuing on if the moments of happiness in life are drowned out by the sadness I feel of every day life I come into the world alone I go out alone I have a loving family amp caring friends I ve a bright future and I have almost a hundred grand to my name without so much as raising a finger to attain it I can t enjoy any of that Instead I focus on the fact that I can t enjoy it I focus on everything I do that s wrong regrettable past actions and why must I be hurtful towards anything I care about even if it s in jest I can be one of the nicest people and that s fine In fact I like making people happy because since I can t enjoy being happy at least I can window shop and watch your happiness What s the point of carrying on though It s as if everything I eat turns to ash The only reason I ve not killed myself just yet is because it s selfish and hurtful towards the people I care about I had a fairly disturbing thought process recently You always go out of your way for others Do something for yourself something you ve wanted since middle school Kill yourself I realize now that my preferred method for selfinflicted death is gunshot to the head Anything else would give me too much of a hesitation I have plenty to live for I don t want too I spend too much effort trying to accomplish my goals for things could make me happy I m tired of trying to be happy and failing constantly I can t make a moment of happiness last when I have an ocean of painful things to remember or harp on Even if it s not from that ocean I can look at other perspectives of my life and be disappointed in myself Ignoring the introspective causes of depression in my life another source is the complete meaningless of my life I work semi hard to attain certain goals and values and once completed the joy is rather limited but still existent However I am tired I am tired of work at the age of The rest of my life will be filled with nothing but work till I retire Wake up work sleep Repeat Why That s such a mind numbing task to endure for the rest of my for see able future It s definitely not something to look forward too I don t want to be alive if I am going to be forced to work for the rest of my life Fun fact I ve been commited to the hospital for self harm in fifth grade and have attempted suicide four times my last attempt being senior of highschool I used to cut myself I ve been put on antidepressants three times all with no real effect I was offered to moderate this place a while back I said no because this was gonna be hard to tell other people you should be alive when I didn t want to Of course the reason I gave MWM for my decline was that this place was far too depressing TL DR The emotions caused by the negatives of life outweigh the emotions by the positive So why carry on I want to stop putting effort into being alive It s far too much work and appears to have little to no pay off,high,high

I feel like everyday is getting harder and harderNow before I say much I wanna establish that I am not clinically depressed because I ve never gone to a therapist and also I think depression is just a little too serious for me to have at the age of I wouldn t like to insult anyone actually having depression by saying that I have depression because I really don t have a reason or diagnosis to think so Anyway I ll give the short note here I was groped by a guy who worked at my house twice and I still cry about it That was years ago My ex boyfriend forced himself on me not fully but enough for me to tell him no and he wasn t listening to me I was also forcefully dragged into a dark alleyway by a friend who was at the time and kissed forcefully and also put in like a physical lock so I couldn t leave I was Plus now I m in th grade and will have to find a college soon but I don t have anh interests I can draw and everyone keeps forcing me to join fashion designing but I don t want to because I don t like it I wanted to be a singer but I cannot sing There s virtually nothing left for me I don t wanna join art or music and I have no academic or political interests That eliminates everything And I m stressed out and to the point where I would rather just die and than to face the disappointing faces of everyone when everyone is off to college and I still haven t figured it out and god knows that they don t take it very well here in India Here you HAVE to go to college after th no exceptions or going after a few years So I m pretty much ready to die Anyway those are just the things that happened to me and I felt weird typing it out to strangers so I hope nobody trolls me lol These things have taken a toll on me through the years as I didn t feel as strongly about them back then as I do now They really make me cry every night and feel disgusted in every single way But these things don t compare to the guilt I feel for what all I ve done to the people I love Well for starters I m very rude to my friends and I make cruel jokes at them They know I m joking but now I just feel bad I feel like they don t like me at all and don t want me around them Secondly I ve broken up a group of friends I had I had a very big group of guy friends years ago my boyfriend and the other guy come from this group and they were all boys and I was the only girl in the group I don t know how or why but suddenly of them had a crush on me Mind you I m not cute at all and like I said I m rude and mean so I really don t know what they saw Anyway one of them became my now ex boyfriend whom I mentioned earlier and I kind of juggled between the other and I feel horrible They eventually because of that reason got jealous and hateful of each other and the group broke up but not in a traditional way We still hung out but it was just not the same anymore Obviously I caused that by being so indecisive and mind my language hoe y Then I broke up with my then boyfriend and got with a friend who had a crush on me from the group and he is the best thing to ever happen to me We are sti together to this day and he really loves me and appreciates me I m not sure about it anymore though You see I am a horrible person and I did a horrible thing to him even though I love him the most and he is the best boyfriend ever We have a long distance relationship and that s important because we usually talk over texts and calls and meet once a month In we moved to another place and I made some friends at school I started talking to this guy as friends because he was my classmate and we chatted once in a while One day the conversation just hit the fan and got really weirdly sexual but we were joking and just laughing about it all Now I realize how weird that was and how it was cheating So anyway a few months ago J wanted my boyfriend to read a chat so I gave him my Instagram password He opened my ID read the chat and we were cool Later though naturally he checked out my ID while I checked out his He found that chat and it s weird because I had a load of conversation after that which was just normal but I don t know and why he scrolled that much into the past that he found it I guess he was already suspicious So he found it and confronted me about it in a very non confrontational way and he said he was very hurt I told him it was a joke and it can be seen in the way the friend and I were replying to each other But obviously he was upset and his trust was broken and I apologized profusely and did everything I could to make things better and eventually everything went back to normal kind of So a few days ago we were chatting as usual and I noticed that since a few days he wasn t like responding to anything sexual about me or like if I sent him a picture or a text like that I asked him and he said he can t tell me the reason but he just doesn t like to sexy anymore because it makes him mad at me I was shattered but I already knew why he was saying that Then after a few days I asked him to tell me the reason and I was right He told me it was because of that thing and I apologised and he said he understands I m not that person anymore but that he just can t do it over text otherwise it reminds him of that and he feels disgusted Understandable I was so very sad and upset and felt guilty all over again But here s the catch since a few days things have gotten somewhat better between us and he assures me that he still loves me but I know he s lying The guilt and regret just keeps on getting bigger and bigger and bigger Now I can t take it and it s not even the fact that he doesn t love me because I know why It s just the fact that I wod hurt someone like him who has helped me through everything I ve described in the second paragraph and has made me a better person the realisation that even though I did not intend to do it I sti very much cheated on my own boyfriend when I preach that cheating is the worst thing ever and the fact that no matter if he leaves me or things get better nothonf will reverse this action of mine and things and trust wi never be the same again That s the worst part it s irreversible Lately the guilt has gotten to the point where I want to die It has mixed with all the experiences and actions of mine from the past and now I don t even want to get better I just want it to end and die There s no solution I don t want a solution I just want out Nobody will care after I die because I ve successfully hurt and betrayed everyone that ever would care Nobody will miss me Nobody even likes me I don t hate my appearance as much but it s not good I don t love myself in any way because of all the things I described All I want now is either a solution as to how I can die painlessly because I m a coward or just a reverse button to everything I just typed to vent and I ve told this all to my boyfriend and he tried his best to reassure me that I m wrong and that whatever I m saying will get better but I know it won t because the only way it can get better for me or for me to make peace with it is that it never would have happened and that s impossible to do There s not way for me only out So I don t know what responses to expect from anyone if I get any that is but just Don t tell me to tell my parents as they won t listen and I don t want to share my private stuff with them as you can see this is all very weird to tell to my parents Plus my brother almost tried to kill himself last year and we are still dealing with his depression to be dealing with mine too Plus my mother is very tired and sad in her life I don t wanna make it worse for her I already do enough of that everyday by being a horrible child Don t tell me to go to a therapist as I can t without my parents and I will have to tell them then which I don t wanna and I don t want to get better as I said before because it won t change anything about my guilt If it was a trauma I wanted to recover from I could but with guilt there s not much to be done Don t suggest trivial things like go out more or talk to your friends and stuff because it doesn t help and if you know how that works you know Please don t make it any weirder than it has to be I was already embarrassed about typing this because of all the things I ve done so please don t say anything to that Don t be mean about my boyfriend or my friends or my family They re all amazing people and you re not anybody to judge them You can criticize them if there is even any criticism over the details I gave but nothing from your side as you don t know them I know all the things I listed are just teenage stuff and all that but I just needed to vent and get some support as my boyfriend didn t do a very good job because obviously he doesn t wanna talk to me anymore So yeah thanks,high,high

TIERD Background I am F and I have had my autoimmune disease for almost years I live in pain every minute of everyday Each morning I take my medication and lay in bed and cry for an hour till it starts working I m constantly nauseous I have drs but they only manage things nothing gets better The disease affects my joints my stomach and anxiety I have had several surgeries including total knee replacements part of my colon removed hysterectomy just to name a few About a year ago when the opioid epidemic created by the CDC US government was implemented my pain dr of years said he could not prescribe the dose of pain medication I was on anymore With no choice I am now taking of the doses I had been prescribed for years Another side effect of the government being involved in my medications is my anxiety meds are very dangerous in combination with the pain meds My dr pcp for years who prescribed them said he isn t going to anymore no matter what It means NOTHING to any dr that I have no life anymore Their hands are tied Currently I can t deal with this anymore I m not going to get better in fact it took me years to get to a regimen of medication that somewhat worked I have no energy to try or care I looked into other drs and they seem worse than the ones I have now My husband of years wants to go together but we have a teenager who I don t want to leave without both parents My husband agreed to stay About a month ago I went outside by my favorite tree with my gun and tried to shoot myself The gun jammed My husband who was in the house ran outside and took my gun but yesterday while he was working I found his loaded gun and hid it His is better than mine Mine had never been shot before but his has My whole family knows how fucked up I feel My sister even agreed to take my kids if something happens to my husband and I I m very lost If my husband and I go together the kids will get a decent payout from life insurance If only I go then my husband gets it but mine isn t much since I don t work and I m disabled Why is it ok to make me live like this I throw up a bunch very nauseous get really bad headaches my stomach kills me my teeth are falling apart I can t sleep I worry about EVERYTHING I can t even open a water bottle without help because I don t have much strength anymore I can walk some although it s painful and I limp My arms amp legs don t bend or straighten normally my range of motion sucks The last x my husband and tried to get out I got really sick and threw up everywhere or I just hurt so bad I couldn t handle it My husband isn t a bad person and he is the only person who truly sees and feels me He works picks up groceries cleans the house makes dinner helps me get dressed paints my nails amp genuinely tries to make my life easier He always tells me he doesn t want me to go then I say so you want me to be miserable and feel like shit all the time Or I say You are very selfish you expect me to live so you aren t lonely Of course he says no to both questions but I only have choices Commit suicide or Stay and feel tortured Side note I started using medical marijuana even though it isn t legal in my state It helps but by no means could it be compared with my old pain medication Another fact is my pain dr does urine drug screens which not only check for illegal drugs but also shows what prescribed medications are in my system Caught with marijuana would not be good My husband doesn t use marijuana so he takes my medicine the day we go to the appointment and passes my drug test but it shouldn t be like this Everyone says there is always light at the end of the tunnel but I can t even find the tunnel I wish I could take all my medicine and overdose but I m scared it won t work I think the gun is the best option I have notes written and my husband and I have planned my funeral I m so fucking overwhelmed Summary I m sick in pain amp I am ready to die,high,high

I Feel Like Every Day is a Day Closer to Giving UpIt s been almost two full years since this http www reddit com r relationship advice comments n jav exbest friend of yrs and the girl i wanted to bullshit began and I ve been through even more since I worked my ass off to get through school and work to save money until I could afford to move I had a semester completely free from my major and the other people involved in this situation I focused mainly on work and saving up money I even managed to break away from counseling and got off of my antidepressant meds which just made me a lethargic apathetic piece of furniture I thought being more of myself was supposed to be a good thing I moved to the opposite side of the country and enrolled in a new school but all the bad shit followed me here I occasionally get texts from people at my old school criticizing me about new gossip they ve heard about me I m not making any friends not for lack of my strained efforts and I spend all my time alone because my roommates are constantly at work not like they care anyway I am always trying to get them to hang out with me but they aren t interested I try my best not to think about all the bad shit that has happened but it still brings me down until I m just dwelling in my apartment like a lonely hermit When people don t want to be my friend or hang out with me it makes me feel down When I feel down my mind wanders back to all that I ve suffered through and reminds me how much it still bothers me I would be so happy if I could just have one day where I didn t wish I was dead I ve tried everything I can think of but it just seems like this world rewards evil deeds and punishes those who are good at heart Our culture proves it and the general population glorifies it I don t want to live in a place like that EDIT It also seems necessary to mention that it is also extremely hard for me to venture out because I don t know why but I get super nauseous any time I m in a motor vehicle This is not like me at all I mean I couldn t do roller coasters and had issues with airplanes and helicopters but when I m driving It s been a problem since leaving home and it IS made worse by anxiety but I even get sick when I m completely calm I don t know what to do I ve been to the only insurance approved doctor around several times but they don t have any answers It s another contributing factor to my reclusion EDIT Happy Super Lonely nd Birthday to Me No love No friends No joy,high,high

What am I missing I was about to write I hope I am missing something as the title but that would be wrong I am not hoping per se more like I m checking one more time if I left the stove on before I leave There s nothing for me in here I hold very little value for money belongings social status And people are worthless to me because they value the aforementioned are making themselves about those and from those I am afraid that if I explain myself or my views fully I ll infect someone else with this but be warned I ll elaborate and will tell my views if asked they might seem not that bad at first or for a few years but it s a seed that grows slowly So don t be arrogant about it it s nothing special it s not a big secret and that s the twist Anyway There s just no point going on there s nothing here for me that I can see To me life seems to be just a waiting place for death to keep yourself busy so death can surprise you But how to keep yourself busy I nothing holds meaning to me I can t get attached to things that disappear eventually I am too emotional for that My memories of the most beautiful wonderful and magnificent people I have met are torturing me as it is And I don t want any more pain The most meaningful things hurt the most and that s why I don t want them because the pain is always the last thing of that deal That s what I am left with And if I continue regardless it will eventually lead me to the same conclusion the pain kills me Life is so beautiful that it kills me So why die in pain when it is possible to die without it If I don t take life to my heart then there s no point continuing either because I m holding back nothing is that important to me it s meaningless So here s why I am writing this is something I am missing before I make the biggest decision I can ever make An unchecked stove somewhere If so where should I look for it when I am somewhat aware of this gt A Sioux creation story says that long ago the Creator gathered all of Creation and said I want to hide something from the humans until they are ready for it It is the realization that they create their own reality gt The eagle said Give it to me I will take it to the moon gt The Creator said No One day they will go there and find it gt The salmon said I will bury it on the bottom of the ocean gt No They will go there too gt The buffalo said I will bury it on the Great Plains gt The Creator said They will cut into the skin of the Earth and find it even there gt Grandmother Mole who lives in the breast of Mother Earth and who has no physical eyes but sees with spiritual eyes said Put it inside of them gt And the Creator said It is done Also this might be a long conversation or the shortest ever with no reply So if you are not up to the challenge help someone else your words may be wasted on me Speak from the heart and if nothing comes up then continue on it s not your fight Truth should be effortless But don t be intimidated your words can make a difference who knows it can be as little as Dude you forgot to drink your coffee and then it all dawns on me lol no promises though don t beat yourself up but anyway I wanna go so did leave something undone Something worth checking out Inb ur lyfe AC movie Rogue one movie and the year Thanks in advance,medium,high

"I am doing HORRIBLE. I can't stop thinking about my fp. It's been nearly two weeks since he has messaged me. What did I do?
 
 The last time we hung out, I subtly described to him that he's my favorite person. I didn't use any bpd terms, but I just sort of told him how much I appreciate and admire him, and how I find myself relying on him and being dependent on him often.
 He didn't seem weirded out, he even reciprocated a bit. He told me stuff like ""I love hanging out with you too."" ""I love being friends too.""
 He told me that... so why? Why is he ignoring me?
 CW: self harm ideation
 
  It hurts so badly, it hurts so badly I've been wanting to cut to just make the pain physical.
 I don't understand why he would say such sweet and nice things to me and immediately ignore me for 2 weeks.
 
 I've been telling myself over and over how much I hate him and how much I want to cut him out completely.
 But it's not true...I really don't want to cut him out. I want to stay friends and I want to be someone he can rely on too.
 I'm IN LOVE with him. I love him so much it hurts me every day because I can never have him and I'm wasting my time.
 
 I'm kept up at night thinking about what I might have done wrong.
 I might have scared him away? Maybe he didn't mean all those nice things he said, he must have only said them to quell me.
 
 I honestly would rather he tell me he thinks I'm a freak and that he never wants to speak to me again...instead of doing whatever this is.
 It is pure and complete AGONY. I'm losing my mind.

I think I m done I see no point in continuing my life It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself the vast majority that feel no empathy I see all of these reflected in myself too another idiotic follower of the human condition driven purely by emotion and not by logic Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding I was born too early to escape it too Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible and I could just leave this hellhole behind and things may have been different But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of Only music and video games have stood between me and this They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it so I didn t have to deal with it But they haven t worked now for a good few months The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this Nothing I have tried has helped No antidepressants no therapy no thought mechanism has eased the pain The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man and now I am at wit s end Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid so what s the point in even trying to live with it I just want to fall asleep and never wake up never have to feel a thing again I want to be free from the tyranny of sadness and depression free from the cage of anxiety and panic I want to die,high,high

life just seems pointless im senior year i guess i ll start out with how i got to this point i started to feel down th grade around the time my grandpa was in the hospital which i wasn t close to he would come in and out of the hospital and i guess seeing him that way just hurt i dont even know why i felt that way when those words that he said when i was in th grade still lingered i still enjoyed doing simple things and still wanted to try out new things i bought a ukulele got in to drawing and tried making friends i actually met one of my ex best friend she will be coming up at the end it wasn t bad at all but i felt this nagging feeling above my head that i was able to ignore cut to th grade oh boy was that year fun thats when i started questioning why i was still even here breathing i started high school and most of my classes were filled with people from others schools which already had their own friends of groups compared to how i was in middle school i started to become real quiet my middle school wasn t that big and everyone pretty much knew everyone so it was easy for me to conversate with others at the end of th grade i also realized that i was starting to develop anxiety i would shake and my body temperature would go up amp was on the verge of passing out anyways as you can tell trying to talk to others was quite intimidating i started to feel alone and just isolated from everyone in my classes not only that i was in advanced classes and felt so stupid in all of them i couldn t even reach their level of intelligence i was dumb compared to all of them i no longer wanted to participate i would hate when teachers called on me it was the worst feeling ever oh i forgot to mention my grandpa died a month later after my freshman year started i pick up others emotions so i was sad would cry over everything and just felt like complete shit i had about friends at the time which i guess you could say i no longer am friends with them anyways school work started to pile up i started getting stressed about it and would even cry at times because i couldnt understand some of the stuff i started to develop some thoughts that weren t healthy in my head i would tell myself im stupid worthless all the teachers saw me as some excuse o a student and so on i started to just lock myself in my room and sleep i developed an eating disorder which i thought was normal at the time because teenagers right i wouldn t shower for days yet my anxiety kept me worried about how i looked imagine caring about what others think of you while you don t even care about yourself its a fucking pain in the ass i gained a friend that year but eventually cut ties with her during the summer th grade came along i continued to take advanced classes just to make my parents proud i wanted them to be proud of me and tell me that just one time turns out i just disappointed them more this is when i started to skip days at school telling my mom i felt sick and so once i even faked i was sick but it turned out i had strep throat kinda funny tbh ayways my grades started to go down i was usually and A or A B type of girl but my grades started going towards C s and at times D s I met this guy as well that i started to develop feelings for this was the first time i actually wanted to step out of my comfort zone and get to know them i still dont know till this day if it was a good or bad idea i honestly don t remember much about th grade year it seems a little fuzzy all i know is that my depression and anxiety got worse i was thinking about suicide more often and even thought of ways to do it just a reminder my parents and siblings had no idea that i was feeling down i would always act hyper and made jokes just to make them laugh i fake laughed and tried not to get them worried th grade i had only like adv class and an AP class to get myself to take a break i told myself at the end of th grade that i would get my shit together and even managed to get decent grades on the st weeks of school i started to have trouble sleeping my thoughts started to get more vivid and had nightmares i also almost passed out while talking in a group discussion because i was so anxious i dont know how many times i started to write suicide letters i would have breakdown every other month thst led me to just wanting to end it all this took place so last yeart then started everything started to go to shit the guy i mentioned earlier yeah i admitted my feelings towards him and he then started to talk to me less eventually we stopped talking completely mostly it being my fault i also lost my bestfriend i dont know what happened or what i did but we just stopped talking it hurt a lot it really fucking hurt i went days without eating and lost almost pounds i was pounds foot inchs so i finally became underweight that was the only thing i had under control my weight i felt at ease i liked seeing my ribs popping out i liked the way i looked for the first time even now i wish i would stop eating so much this was around the time finally talked to the counselor and my mom and sister came up and talked to them about how i was feeling when we walked out of school my sister just told me you should ve judt killed yourself in there i got a therapist around march i started taking medication went from lexapro prozac some sleeping pills and some other stuff i cant remember lexapro left me feeling numb i couldn t cry i couldn t feel a thing i remember explaining to my friend the feeling its as if you are trapped in the glass box and no matter how many times you try to break it and get out of there it didn t work you just yelled at no one when me and my bestfriend defriended i got a new friend i wasn t at the best state physically and mentally i wouldn t shower for a week i was just bone i would skip a lot of class oh yeah did i mention that i started skipping almost everyday i remember thinking whats wrong with me i wasn t like this how would i let myself get to this point i was someone that cared a out school even if it was challenging i wasn t one to get down over small or big things i wouldn t get hurt over one small comment almost at the end of march i first tried attempting with the lexapro i only took but i called my friends and they picked me up i spent time with them for a little while i stopped myself before i took more so im not sure if its really an attempt i didn t mention this to my therapist because you know i d get sent to the hospital weeks later i attempted again this time i took some pain killers it was at the time they were like mg per pill I just felt a little sick from the stomach but that was all I called my friend again and told her what was going on of them came over and talked to me my friend asked me if i wanted to tell my mom in which i did we ended up crying a lot she kept asking me why do i want to die why am i feeling like this why dont i see value in life do you know how shitty i felt i the person that lives in this body doesn t even know the cause my friends had called out but i started to act hyper i always do this to make others think i am doing well now they ordered pizza and we ate they both worked at the same place so they called the manager and told them that they could actually go in my heart broke a little that day i always wished someone would stay with me even when i told them the opposite they just left they believed i was doing well i ended up telling my therapist what i did a week later since thats when i was scheduled to go she ended up sending me to the hospital and told my mom that its best to do so or i ll end up succeeding although it was nice for me to not worry about anything anymore i didnt like it i wasn t with the people that i cared about all i needed was to be with the ones that cared and loved me even if they were acting as if they did thats all i needed i pushed them away so many times and i know its my fault i know i am the one to blame but i still felt even more depressed because i wanted them to tell me no i am not leaving i wanted them to just lay with me and hug me and just tell me everything was going to be okay even if i didnt believe that thats all i ever wanted june came along so school ended i tried again i tried overdosing on sleeping pills i took about this time even till this day i still have no clue what i meant to text one of my friends ah i forgot to mention the friend i gained after i lost my best friend dated my brother i started to like her a little after they broke up and she even admitted that she was kind of gaining interest on me while dating my brother i was so confused during this time though because she never told me straight forward if she liked me or not i wasn t in the best state of mind obviously so all that made sense to me was that she hated me she never liked me and just used me to gain information about my brother i had also stopped talking to my other friends and even stopped telling one of them the same one that works with her about what i was thinking because the first thing she would do is tell her anyways im pretty sure it caught her by surprise that i texted her that day and it not making any sense all i remember was going unconscious and then waking up several times i would try to plug in my phone to charge and i thought i would and would pass out and then wake up to do the same thing standing up was hard i almost fell because of how heavy my body felt thankfully i didn t throw up i hate throwing up cue to the next day i had my therapy appointment im surprised my therapist didn t ask if i was okay i was shaking a lot and couldn t focus i was still out of it and had the same feeling i had the day before but without feeling my body heavy passing out randomly and so i even drove that day which i know i shouldn t have but i wasn t thinking I can t even remember much of that day I do remember around pm though I started to text my friends I cant remember what i said or what they said i do remember getting angry and i started to get aggresive the last thing i told the friend that i liked at the time no wonder that my brother left you before that i do remember her saying that you can t help someone that doesn t want help thats all i can remember that just hit me for some reason all those months that i tried getting help seemed like nothing to her i was so fucking upset this was the same person that dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression someone that even attempted thats why it hurt so much i was trying so hard to get help even if it was hard for me to open up i was never taught to talk about my feelings so the fact that i told an adult meant that i seriously was in need of help i ended up blocking everyone and i cried so much i cried a lot it hurt it still hurts she even told me she thought of telling me that i should ve killed myself now i wish that she did say those words then i would have an actual reason i texted them the next day and told them i was sorry they forgave me which they shouldn t have maybe it was better and if we just left it like it was i still hate myself for saying those words till this day i haven t been the same ever since nothing feels real cut to th grade which is now i was planning on doing it on my birthday i wrote a note each day leading to it and i decided to do it days earlier i was supposed to start my first day at my job i called out and told my mom i was working i went to the park i was planning on slitting my wrist turned out the blade amp pocket knife didn t work so well on my wrist and barely did anything i didn t tell my friends about it and decided to just wait till my actual birthday thinking it was just the day you know my birthday came up and i was waiting for my friends to say happy birthday they didn t i posted on my story crying i wrote on the last note they forgot about my birthday the day i hated the most my birthday made me hate it even more i wasn t worthy of their time they saw my stort and felt bad and texted me they came to my house and gave me last minute gifts they felt forced i doubt they even wanted to be there cue to now i finally pushed them off for good i told them what i was planning and told them how i was feeling they ended up writing a letter to my mom like days ago and left it in the mail i was the one that went to get the mail that day i read it and i got really upset angry sad the people that i thought knew me the most wanted to send me to the hospital all i wanted was for them to stay with me not send me somewhere in which i feel trapped somewhere where they are not i got angry and texted them were involved in this one wasnt i texted on the gc where all were one the one that wasnt a part of it got upset over what i said the others didnt say anything until i said if that was all they got i started saying to tell me how they really feel about me because i knoe they are holding themselves back just because they are afraid i ll break i blocked all of them after that and now i have no reason for no longer to stay here even one of the people which were feeling suicidal a while back wated to send me to the hospital when i didn t even think about sending them there because i know it wasn t what they needed or wanted they needed to be with people that loved them and made sure they were safe i didnt get out of her car that day and told her i wasn t leaving she gave in and slept in my room why couldn t they do the same for me am i not worthy of having someone do that for me its kind of funny i was in my car the other day in the same spot we were in when we skipped school one day at that time i thought i was really alone but now now i ve actuall reached that i am alone now i have no one in the end i am the one that never deserved to be here i didn t deserve them i didn t deserve to live i should ve died a long time ago i dont know how long i ll be here there is no point in living anymore im just a walking robot at this point i no longer have anyone or anything to live for,high,high

Can t get out of financial debt Thinking about suicide Hello r SuicideWatch I have been a lurker so far but as of today I would like to express my feelings somewhere Better here than telling my family I m and from Germany My depressions and other psychological issues including being afraid of meeting people low self esteem etc have been a culprit since years now I tried to commit suicide a couple times already First time when I was last time when I was I have been in Therapy around times by now I can t really recall the correct number switched between several anti depressants and the Medical Officer I had an appointment with last year diagnosed me as being Unable to work for an unknown time and signed the papers Since then and this is really stupid I compensated this with spending a good amount of money for Gifts for my Family Ranging from Cigarettes Sweets etc to PC Games just to make them happy and kind of feel a bit better inside Anway This now led to the situation that my Bank Account is overdrawn I was able to do this since I had a small job for a year where I had an income of roughly the amount you are allowed to earn over here without having to pay taxes It was a Home Office Job I had to get up at in the morning and work for hours a day Not that much and I was able to pull it off The Bank then gave me a Credit limit of I lost the job after this one year because the company had to restructure Meh they nearly went bankrupt that s why This is what really downed me next to several other things like being single and having a lot of old friends around me in a relationship one of my brothers married I m still living at home and have to deal with it that my Mom has to take care of me help me financially but I just can t ask her for a full paycheck to help me even out my bank account I just don t know anymore on how to cope with the depression low self esteem the mistakes I made and that I actually kind of did everything to make me get into this situation I really wish there would be a quick way to end it right now without pain since I don t want to feel pain anymore Is there such a way,high,high

Question Has anyone else struggled with wanting to check out for decades m years after my first diagnosis of major depression and only recently prior two months has it become completely debilitating It feels like the normalcy I thought I felt as a high functioning major depressive maybe never was I m panicking almost non stop about fixing everything that s wrong The pain comes in waves and at seemingly random intervals This time around it s a flood of disaster the details of which are too long and uninteresting to mention here A happy ending in life is no guarantee after all eh Today I ll pick a date pick a method and write a note My legal and financial affairs are in order If nothing else I ll then stop unfairly burdening the one and only person who still believes in me I know it s painfully hard for her to see me this way and she deserves better after all the awful things that life has done to her I just hope she ll remember our good times and continue to always be the amazing person that the world knows her to be She ll shine brighter without me,high,medium

I think I just made suicidal gesture Okay So I m in grad school and it really sucks I m really not into the idea of going into academia but I don t want to quit I love my discipline and let s be real I have nothing else going for me That said I can t stand my peers or the faculty I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further given the cost I got into a language program that would be great for my CV but financially speaking I just can t afford to support myself through the summer Outside of loans I m on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don t do this I will not get my degree My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning I have no clue what to do I don t want to give up my degree but I really really HATE my program If I stay I ll be miserable if I go I ll hate myself for quitting I know what your thinking but transferring in grad school is easier said than done Last night I got into a really big argument with my parents It wasn t so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself A few hours later after I got done studying I was really upset I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it So I took my belt off fastened it around my neck tied it to a rack in my closet not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head but either I didn t think it would work or I chickened out I don t really know which it was I took it off and just went to bed So I guess my question is did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it I don t want my parents to worry about me I don t want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation But I also don t think this is something I should brush under the rug,high,high

nightmare so ya don t wreck my life and find out who i am I just called a crysis hotline and it was busy lol and I called more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times then I found another line for some local crysis centre i used to work as a telephone surveyer it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell special one time offer how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you actually that sounds terrible I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can t see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem so basically I am alone I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares it s all up to you she says wow what a thing to say to someone with depression yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me i know that my life is either shitty or it isn t based off my actions I very much know that why would I be depressed if I didn t blame myself just fucking terrible now I m just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal it s like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house well I work fulltime so that s not gonna work and I don t have vacation days and I work nights so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever well that s not really gonna work if I get up at pm and go to bed at noon pm so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life I actually don t mind my job I actually like it there it s the one safe spot in the world is work I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since but I know it s not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all and then it s just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house but why don t I just move out well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn t work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I ve maxed out my credit cards paying them rent which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out I didn t even ask them to change their habits I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration so now I m stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt I m not even hopelessly in debt I just can t leave here but I can t live being this fat anymore because nobody will love me or even even affectionitly touch me I don t even mean sex I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female you know I don t even blame them for regecting me anymore they all actually out of their way nice to me so ya whatever I guess I m taking some art classes and I found out I m very talented lol I m a very honest person in a way that s great on camera But I m fat and people don t have sympathy for fat people well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss if you just try to put them in a normal life situation people inheritly react negatively because fat people are ugly I think it too but ya I can t fix it I know people won t accept this statement but when I m on my healthy diet I feel great and am not hungry because it s well balanced and not extremely low calorie But I come home from work and it s just there is food and sugar everywhere and as soon I get eating it I want more and then i don t care because I think I ve already fucked it up for myself I might as well just eat more so I don t feel bad and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won t seem like unenjoyable effort and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don t want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get double cheeseburgers and each has calories that s calories I can eat in I dunno stop lights away from the mcdonalds and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs on top of the regular diet which is about under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around then all of a sudden I m like calories over my needs and then that s evey day and that s like all in the last hours of the day and the next day maybe I just don t care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two calorie energy drinks and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash it s just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself but if I ever try to just anything just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction I know we re in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don t hate me because I act like I think you hate me but it s not because you hate me it s because I love yes I know I don t know what the word means but I like to use it you and you ll regect me and it s easier for me to perceive it as hate and you go out of your way to say it isn t and you care that little bit and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it s just this natural reaction and attraction no desperation there isn t time to get desperate and you just say I m gonna play it cool and later maybe do something and then you get home and you remember I m almost pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she ll regect you like everyone else because you ve done that that same thing has happend dozens of times and you ve played it out like groundhogs day where you ve done every possible thing reacted everyway tried everything including not trying and it has all ended the same you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym years ago and I m actually in pretty good shape I m just really really fat I lifting and flexibility and I cycle even though it s really hard being so fat and I got down to I m which the lightest I ve been in ever even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage the first time I ve been under bmi since I ve remember checking my weight and now in months I ve thrown away all of it and gained lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food mostly it was always an issue always adding a few hundred calories here and there and now it s like you can sell everything you own get your debt to a controlable level and move out but I have to move walking distance from work because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there vechiles to work after they moved and took me with them it was a mistake to move out with them but I would have no car and I couldn t take my art classes or even have access to a gym because there isn t one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in thin ice around some shores and I m not tryhing to violate the rules it s just it seemed like a good idea I was just gonna jump and swim to shore if I could make it and that seemed like a good idea then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something I dunno it seemed lik e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone but whatever I m really tired now and I just want someone I dunno there is nothing I know nobody can help me the things I want that will make me happy I can t ask and don t have any right to ask but crying makes me tried and I don t like having to hear myself crying wouldn t be so bad if I didn t have to hear the whale it s like someone else it s like I m hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me I m just thinking wrong reacting wrong I just don t interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over or go to therapy for and all of this will start over again tomorrow but it ll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I ll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I ll be happy that s what I have to look forward to the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible,high,high

I see no real reason to go onI ve only lived years and in those years theres only heartbreak and troubles The majority of my family have suffered from depression and terrible anxiety as I have They usually turned to street drugs like meth heroin and weed Which I know weed isn t too bad but still anything like those are not the solution My emotions range from incredibly happy to miserable I m failing school because of my lack of motive and my constant nihilism I hate to play victim or blame my troubles on outside forces I feel as if lifes only going to get worst and I should just end it I failed french and I have to drop it v v I have a stream of absents from school as well thats most likely going to lead to my family going to court And if it does the day before court I ll or the day we get the letter calling for attendance I plan on shooting myself,high,high
Life is basically a absurd horror showHello I am an individual with chronic back and neck pain and some joint pain I have other health issues mental issues They all combine into a being that just thinks about dying and cursing at everything Life seems like pointless suffering and death is the end that returns my consciencousness My life would basically be going to the doctor for because I can t function without them and probably gonna need medication and maybe even become physicaly disabled if things get bad enough That is not what I want I want to set free my consciencousness from the sufferings of just existing Hopefully I will override the biological programming that DNA instils in all living beings and that is to live Just a little longer,medium,high

This is the only place I can talk about thisUsing a throwaway account because I need to get this off of my chest but I m scared of speaking out fully as people I know irl know my reddit account For the last five years I ve been slowly growing more and more sad and upset with life due to my own stupid mistakes I have a loving family and sure we don t always get along but I love them all to pieces The stupid mistakes I made haunt me to this day no one knows about them besides me and the people involved and that kills me I have so many passions I want to pursue like my singing or my art however I m terrified that if my face gets out there one day I ll wake up to hear everyone I love knows what I did I was so so fucking stupid and if I could go back I would have stopped myself It was only five years ago I found out what I did shouldn t have happened that I should have never done it and since then it s been creeping up on me and eating away at me I can t tell anyone about it who I care about and if I went to see a doctor and looked for help I d be scared someone would find out I m scared I d break down I m scared I d lose my place in college I ve thought about killing myself so many times I even tired not taking my crohns and colitis medication for a while hoping this illness would kill me slowly but kill me none the less but my mother soon found the full pill boxes and injections It feels like a huge weight is being dropped on my head I wasn t forced to do what I did I was a stupid child who didn t know what they were getting into or how bad what they were doing was I was naive and now it ll haunt me for the rest of my life however long that ll be anyways Thank you for reading this strangers of Reddit This is the first and only time I ll ever get to say these words,high,high
Just exhausted of continually feeling this way and it s not bound to get any better The past months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me In the time that s passed I ve experienced the following Experienced the end of my first adult love leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me and even if they did they d just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway Lost the majority of my friends after this and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I ve been reluctant to reach out to them Almost didn t graduate from college but barely got by and found myself neck deep in student loan debt Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another This has gotten to the point where I don t even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use Also generally work graveyard hours but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful frequent headaches Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day to a point where I just don t want to deal with it anymore I m just so tired and I can t see this getting any better The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened but as time passed I started leaning more towards it quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won t have to see them because it always ends the same way with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances I don t have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I ve regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back I did want to further my education but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring I think I m at my breaking point I don t know what to do and I don t want to tolerate this anymore I know I m on the younger end of the spectrum and there s the unknown that s waiting for me or whatever but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once I hate to think of using it as an easy way out but at this point I really just don t want to deal with the pain depression and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day,high,high
I don t want to be here I am a young adult going to school on the west coast My family all lives back east so I m not within reach of any family right now My girlfriend broke up with me because I cheated on her My friends all hate me because of what I did I hate myself because of what I did I feel like I m a disappointment to everyone around me I look to the future and see only pain and disappointment My father is an addict as was his father before him My mother is an emotionally abusive depressed individual who has never been there for me I feel that the only thing that I ve known in this life is pain and that the only thing I will be able to bring into other people s lives is pain I don t want to live but I don t want to die because my religious beliefs tell me that my torture if I commit suicide is far greater than the torment I experience daily I don t want to live and I don t want to kill myself I want to die but I don t want to do it myself I want to change but I don t want to be given a second chance to hurt people I want to be happy but I don t want people to disapprove of my actions if my happiness goes against their expectations of me I want to be able to run away from it all and ignore their expectations but I can t run away from myself My feet no longer move towards a future and I m tired of running from my past I hate myself and I feel that others should hate me too but I don t want them too but they should I m taking antidepressants and I ve talked to counselors and trusted adults but all they do is lie to me and want me to quit the only thing that I care about which is school I don t have anybody to turn to even myself I feel that I m already dead but I just haven t realized it yet I don t know what I m looking for on this subreddit because if you tell me that I m a good person I won t believe you if you tell me that everything will be ok I won t believe you and if you tell me that life is precious and worthwhile I won t believe you The only thing standing between me and the edge of a cliff is the thought that I would be hurting others and myself even more if I did end it all I need help,high,high

never been this at risk I m scared I struggled a lot throughout my life but I don t think I ve ever felt this scared for myself I genuinely am at risk for taking my own life I am in a house that has an abundance of medication and we have guns and ammunition I don t know how much longer I can withstand these feelings I m and behind a year in school I dropped out for a period of time because my mental health was so bad I thought my old friends were plotting against me so that I would die That followed a rough break up I still care a lot for my ex and he is my fp I have BPD traits but most are under control I was doing somewhat okay even with the stress of wanting to build a friendship with my ex and that heartbreak but things suddenly came to a huge halt My emotional support animal who I did everything with suddenly passed after an emergency surgery attempt we didn t even know what was going on He had a fatal mutation of a virus and couldn t be saved This happened October Since then things have gotten worse I talked to my ex that night and he was supportive but I didn t talk to him again since as I knew he had exams and didn t want to get in the way I can barely function without my cat and I ve become severely depressed I ve been binge eating constantly and that just makes me want to die even more I have anorexia I live with my family and they re putting immense pressure on me to function and go to school and do all this homework and I just can t function Not only that I m extremely sore right now from my scoliosis and I m pretty sure my period is starting I got ignored by my ex over text after wishing him a happy Halloween and asking him about exams He frequently breaks his phone so I sent it over Instagram and got left on seen I am grasping at threads in order to find a reason to live but things are genuinely so bad and rarely in my entire life have I ever caught a break I m thinking about admitting myself to hospital but I don t want to be cooped up and I don t even know if I want to live so it s kinda like what s the point On the other hand I m afraid and I genuinely feel I might do something I feel like I have a million problems I can t fix and I m drowning in school work and I genuinely don t think I want to continue living I don t know what to do Thanks for reading,high,high
"I am 25F. I was diagnosed with depression at 12, and borderline personality disorder at 23. It comes and goes, but when its bad its BAD. Things are not going amazing in my life at the moment, but also not particularly bad, either. But i feel like I am in a serious slump.I have tried therapy multiple times in the last 13 years, multiple different therapists and approaches but it honestly has never done anything for me at all.I have been on SO many different medications throughout the years, and finally am on one that helps more than the others, but still not fully. Nobody in my family deals with any mood disorders, so they are not very understanding when i do go through slumps, so i feel like I am not taken seriously and no one truly understands how bad i feel.I also do not want to try therapy again for the simple fact that i cannot afford it. I make too much for Medicaid, and even with good insurance i was paying almost $300 out of pocket, twice a month, just for therapy alone, not including my general appointments for my medication.I really only have 3 people i can talk to. One being my boyfriend of 6 years, who is supportive and as helpful as he can be, but given the fact hes never struggled with it himself, he does not really understand. The other is my best friend who is honestly not the greatest friend in general, and i feel like i bother her when i talk to her. The last person is my sister, but she picks and chooses when she wants to listen/help.I hate burdening people with my issues, and i feel that is all i do. But i also feel like I am going to lose my mind. do not really know what to do anymore",medium,medium

it only makes sense that he stopped talking to everyone waiting to die while everyone else waits for him to speak tell me it s okay to fall to let the boulder that i carry fall on my head and crush me to death tell me it s okay to give up this fucking diet and exercise bullshit when there is nothing and no one to live for anyway stop giving a damn about my grades and finances and just let it all collapse on me put up with others and it kills me just as much so kick them to the curb and call it loneliness some friend no friends your son is hanging in the basement or maybe he s running on the treadmill these things the devil laughs but at least im smiling this time,high,high

is this sh a bit of backstory i was diagnosed with anxiety in 2021 and have been on medication since i have no history of sh or thoughts about it i also have been working at a big restaurantbar for about 6 months and really dislike it but i need the money this happened at work about 2 months ago now so it was a hot day and i was scheduled to work for about 8 hours there were lots of wasps around in the outside eating area and they have been known to sting about 3 hours into my shift and i was feeling extremely anxious i found it really hard to concentrate or talk to customers i ended up going to the bathroom and after about 20 mintues i decided to needed to leave and go home all i could think of at the time was to fake getting stung by the wasp to do this i used to end of my key to twist and dig into my skin until it was very red and broke skin i then told my shift manager i have an allergy and need to go home my shift manager sent me home and immediately i felt way better and more calm looking back on it a few months later i have a scar on my arm but i havent thought of doing anything similar since i just wanted to vent and see what you guys think about this or if i should be concerned thanks,medium,medium
To the one quietly contemplating what he would miss I was like you once I had no vision of any overseable future I was blind to life and what it presented me with I was depressed and apathic nihilisticly searching for a way out I went through the motions every day I forced myself out of bed in the morning Usually i overslept with a few hours but luckily very few people could step into my shoes at work so it was tolerated I went to work and collapsed on the bed when i got home I saw no point in the totality of my neverchanging excistence and i wanted to die I wanted cancer i wanted it to end And at the strangest times your wish is often granted A day at the doctor reveiled an abnormality in a lymphenode I was admitted to the cancer treatment hospital for an operation and released a few days later Nothing to write home about really but my belief in a pointless existence had been rocked as i started to realize id be dead at the age of if this was a hundred maybe even years ago Contemplating these things i started with time to realize id actually miss the small things in life if i died I would never have felt the sun on my face again the wind pulling at my clothes The snowstorms chilling my bones and stabbing my cheeks I would never again have eaten a pancake with shugar Never smelt the clean air after a thunderstorm Id never again see a lovely girl walking in a bikini at the beach Never again hear the birds chitter over the mountain stream quietly dancing through the meadows And so these thoughts started to condense and i came to the conclusion that the things i would miss were not specific to say the pancake I would miss the very basic action The seeing hearing feeling tasting and smelling I would miss my senses And thus i knew why i was alive I knew the essence of my existence With this epiphany a new kind of sense came into being a combination of them all It can be described as nothing else than The experience I could suddenly stop when it came over me and just be Just feel the experience of receiving input through the senses It was exhilarating Sitting on a bench in a town square Riding a roller coaster walking in the woods All the things that would challenge my senses and push them further than before And my wish for death slowly started to melt away But wishes granted are often granted with a two barreled shotgun to use a different cliche than the double edged sword one The cancer of course was back and got a real grip this time I was granted my wish and i could never take it back I was admitted again the same day it was discovered and scheduled for a hour open surgery the next day After not eating for a day and drinking lots of foul tasting bowel emptying juices the surgeon came to see me to explain what he was going to do They were going to go inn through my stomach muscles up under the rib cage and remove of the worst affected lymphnodes in my thorax I was given a pill to daze me for insertion of some kind of coma inducing dripper into my spine I believe coma is preferred during these operations over drugs that shut down your nerves I dont even remember counting backwards before the void claimed me for the first time And then my world exploded I was wide open from my pelvis to my ribcage I was mangled and the pain was like a perfect storm The one that lifts you off your feet and slams you into the wall The one that rips trees from the ground and grinds your very soul to cinders I was dying and it couldnt come fast enough Two hands appeared at my side They were female and very pretty The nails were cut short and had no nailpolish They were covered in a brownish residue The skin was smooth but the folds around the joints were prominient It was the hands of a year old woman It never occurred to me to look up All that existed through the storm where those hands and the needle they were injecting into a plastic tube hanging next to my head And so i vanished into the darkness and hoped i would not remember this where i was going next I was floating in nothing and there was something familiar with the interruptions in my existence Sounds it had been called Voices dawned on me and i knew that was it Far away voices were talking A male and a female It was crude and gutteral Ugly cracks in silence I shut them out and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence There is something strangling me I realized waking up I wanted to tell the voices but i couldnt speak I wanted to wave to get their attention but i couldnt move I had no influence on this world I was a rock drowning in a river I was alone A constant high pitched tone started up in the distance The current swept me away and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence This one will be better i thought and decided try life again Are you ok Someone asked me I was in the recovery ward and the storm had abated I still couldnt move but i was able to open my eyes This is progress i remember thinking I am luckier than the last time i lived After recovering from the operation i was placed on a chemo therapy that lasted for months At the start i thought nothing much of it but i soon deteriorated into a quivering shadow of what i once was I was hooked up to the rat poison every weekday but the Thursdays were the worst Two nurses and a doctor usually came visiting with a bag wrapped in aluminium foil carried on a tray They were all wearing gloves and masks Thursdays i wanted to live more than any other day of the week I used to love the nights back then I do to this day actually They were free of the poison and it was bliss All the tubes and wires were disconnected and i felt like pinochio turning into a real boy If i was drugged enough i could almost remember being alive I could almost remember that i once could walk for a mile That i could laugh and run jump and climb a tree Almost alive somewhere There was a room on the ninth floor with some couches chairs and a tv where four patients used to sit and not talk The tv was never on They would stare at me and nod when i entered but never say anything I dont think they even knew each others names But they seemed as close as any friends could ever get I enjoyed their company even though they were years older than me Age didnt seem to matter we were all here and there was nothing to say I started to frequent this room more and more as time passed Everywhere else there were people wanting to talk or look encourage or pity It was disgusting and I hated them all About weeks had passed and a blessed night came again I quietly walked through the corridors until a man came up to me It was the first male nurse i had seen since i was admitted I hadnt thought of it before but this work place was really dominated by women He had made me cereal with milk one of the few things i could swallow without puking back up There is plenty of shugar he said smiling as he handed me the bowl Not waiting for a thank you he turned and left He d seen the night walkers before and knew what was coming The bowl was heavy and i knew i couldnt carry it far so i headed for the stairs leading up to the th floor At the first step i knew i wouldnt be able to climb them this night I had always liked sitting in stairs for some reason and found a sort of poetic beauty in having this meal here The stone was cold and i sat down with the bowl in my lap I had to spent a few moments getting my breath back Being able to bend down to sit is something you might not cherish But once you loose it you realize its immense value Dark empty halls seemed to stretch for an eternity Nothing outside mattered or was even real anymore These halls were the world i knew now the foundation of my existence I started eating my cereals letting go of one piece of my past for each bite Grinding the memories as i chewed Chomp i was climbing in a tree I could see to the end of the world i could climb into the sky Chomp i was on a swing with Eve We were weightless we were flying She was laughing and i shared in her laughter Chomp i was riding a bike I was going faster than i had ever thought possible No runner could ever catch up with me Chomp I was walking to school I was curious of what would come Excited of what we would learn Chomp I was landing my first heelflip on a skateboard I was proud i was admired by others i was accepted Chomp I was riding a moped I could go wherever i wanted i was free Chomp I was running through the woods with an ag automatic rifle I was in a brotherhood I was defending a nation Chomp I was at a party talking to Kristin I was in love Tears started streaming down my face as she vanished but there was no going back and i continued eating Chomp I was on extacy at a rave The beats vibrated through the air that surrounded me I was a spiral galaxy i was dancing flame Chomp I was being told i had cancer I was speechless Chomp i was walking into a small room of people with strange eyes on the ninth floor I was missing something important Chomp I was handed a bowl of cereals from a smiling man I was grateful Chomp i was siting down on stone steps I was sitting Chomp i was eating cereal I was eating Chomp i am chewing I am the sum of my experiences and memories I am old My whole life had vanished as i finished my last meal A calm feeling of being whole came over me and i was ready I sat the bowl down closed my eyes and then i died You cant sleep here the male nurse told me Your immune system is nonexistent and these steps are cold Lets get you back to bed And that is how my next existence started I was hollow for a long time after that It was like sensing through a veil Like listening to voices from under water Everything was far away and i was looking at reality from outside Time passed and i went again to the room on the ninth floor There were three now They nodded as i entered but seemed to look at me differently recognizing something And suddenly i saw what they had always said as it echoed in my mind We who are about to die salute you And they were right We were gladiators we were fighters and we had all been sentenced to die But each moment we had was a treasure more precious than any earthly riches We had nothing we could loose nothing we could want nothing that could ever be taken away from us Our life our thoughts our actions and opinions were no ones but our own By letting go of everything we had gained something new A new beginning where each experience is a separate existence Like an eternal supply of white paper and colored pencils We had gained life And so i write this post not only to free myself from previous battles and to wake again to a new existence But to tell you that in your next existence you will one day wake up and realize it is all better that today is a good day I promise,high,high
