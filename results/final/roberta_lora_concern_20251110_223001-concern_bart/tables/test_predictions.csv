Things are getting weirdI ve been formally diagnosed with anxiety but not depression since the diagnosis was a long time ago and I haven t been able to go to a doctor since insurance problems I kind of see my emotions as waves and notice that the highs don t last as long and the lows are getting more intense It s like every time I start to feel healthy and motivated I know in the back of my mind it won t last more than a few days to a week But something weird is happening this time Ive been feeling very paranoid these last few days like I m constantly missing something I haven t slept right I ve been sleeping for too long but I m constantly waking up nervous and anxious in the middle of the night I m even starting to hear things that aren t there I don t know how else to describe it I used to eat emotionally now I fluctuate between overeating and not eating or drinking for days But the paranoia is the worst like when you have a weird feeling that something bad is about to happen or when you forget something important It s been lingering constantly for the past few days Everything s lost meaning I feel foggy and hopeless There isn t any point in going to seek help and pay out of pocket I won t be able to afford it There isn t any meaning to much of anything these days,medium,medium

Suicide is selfish permanent solution to a temporary problem Bullshit I have heard these for years It drives me fucking insane I find it amazing people don t see the blatant hypocrisy They think it is selfish for someone to kill themselves and put their family through pain But somehow they don t see it as selfish that they expect someone who is suffering to keep living so that their family or friends don t have to suffer through the loss Like really as if it is isn t enough of a shitty deal to be depressed and suicidal they have to stick you with the guilt of being selfish for wanting to just be done with it all Unreal And I m the selfish one Oh and my other favorite Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem Yeah ok Spoken like someone who has no idea what chronic depression is like There is nothing temporary about it It is forever You might get some brief breaks from it but it s never gone for good,high,high

I want to sit still and feel peace. I want to let go of the white hot emotions inside of me. I try and try to let go and to soothe myself, but to no avail. Time after time, the cycle repeats, and I end up in the same place. I don't know why I expect things to be different sometimes. Hope seems so stupid right now. I'm trying to have it, though. I'm so lonely. And being with people makes it worse. Even those who I think I care for.

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,high,high

Sensorimotor OCD and suicideSince August of last year I ve been obsessed with the physical sensation of breathing This initially came from an immense cannabis triggered anxiety attack which then latched onto how short of breath I felt in those days Like any other affliction it seems to fluctuate from being tolerable most days to being something that makes me have multiple panic attacks on a daily basis Hyperventilation and this naturally go hand in hand since because I m unwillingly focused on every breath I take I end up getting more oxygen in than my body really needs My life doesn t have a lot going for it right now even though compared to last year I m probably over the moon I have a job after being unemployed for more than a year even though I hate work with a passion regardless of whatever job it is and am in the first romantic relationship I ve ever been in in my life Regardless of all of these positives this breathing obsession ebbs and flows to the point where the past three quarters of a year have felt like a long winded dark night of the soul If things get worse again I feel as though I want to fade to black for good I ll miss my partner I love him to pieces I ll miss the few friends that call once in a blue moon but I just don t know if I can live with this anymore I ve tried half a dozen antidepressants I ve tried eating better I ve tried exercising I ve gone to therapy and practiced CBT and nothing s worked I don t know what to do anymore I don t want to hurt my partner but I don t know how much longer I can go on living like this It s alienating it s hard as hell to talk to anyone at all about this because I know nobody who s ever dealt with this It s maddening I feel my sanity on the verge of snapping I can t deal with it anymore,high,high

Getting Worse Deteriorating Self WorthWas at the coffee shop several days ago that I go to so I can get out of the house and talked with a girl working at the counter She had heard from one of the other workers that I liked to draw and asked if I could draw I smiled and said yes She asked me if I could paint and I said that I could Nothing fancy of course I told her about how I ve been wanting to go to a place nearby where they have paint supplies to use there but I didn t want to go alone This girl responded with I d love to go I was in shock when I heard this as I m in my early s and have been rejected by girls since I first tried at I ve always been socially awkward and have just gotten more that way over the years from bullying and harassment I told her I was surprised by her response and how the previous girl I asked to go out there thought I was asking for sex and humiliated me in front of everyone in the store She gave a sad aww why and I told her I had no idea She asked when I wanted to go and I told her that my schedule is usually free so whatever time is convenient for her She said she would be happy to go at the first convenient time for her I was actually feeling somewhat happy just knowing I d be able to go out with someone and do something fun I told her she could have my number and just call me whenever she thought was a good time and proceeded to give her my number My anxiety since then has been really high consistently Fast forward a few days and I hadn t received any call or text so when I finally met her at the coffee shop again I asked her if she still wanted to go paint She told me she wrote my number down and misplaced it only to find it in her work attire She sent me a text to confirm the number and I added her to my contacts That girl motivated me to do more art in the coffee shop but my depression and anxiety constantly surround me days would go by until I gave in and tried to lightly bring up the subject of whether she had any idea when would be convenient for her Her response was I ve been really busy I broke down several days later and sent her a text saying that I was feeling really miserable and needed someone to talk to I thought for sure she was going to get irritated with me and finally just stop talking to me Her response was one of the kindest I ve ever had from anyone more so from a girl She offered to sit with me and talk after they closed the shop and she was definitely wanting to go paint with me I sent a few more texts about how miserable I ve felt just being stuck in my head and how I couldn t believe the kindness she was showing me compared to anyone in this life She shared her own experiences and I could actually relate to her At this point I started to fall more in love I guess At the end of the night we sat outside and talked I almost started crying while talking to her because the more she shared the more I could relate until another worker who I think was making fun of me for the previous incident with the other girl pulled up to us on his motorcycle and asked if we wanted to go to the nearby diner and maybe eat something I had to use the restroom so I gave in and said yes jokingly saying that if they have a restroom then sure I try as hard as I can to minimize showing any kind of problems going on with me just to avoid the anger I have from setting off stupid aggressive people We get up and meet at the diner where it s now of us including another worker and suddenly the one on one talk with the girl turned into a fucking group therapy session where the other two blatantly stated they ve never experienced the hardships I ve had to go through and shared their own stories I could see everyone was beginning to get progressively more depressed as I shared I couldn t bring myself to share everything I wanted to with the girl just to connect with her I wanted to so much but there I was locked in my fucking head fighting anger and sadness from overwhelming everyone It was about in the morning when we finally got up the guy on the motorcycle said he would be at the coffee shop to hear the rest of my story We had a small talk outside of the diner and since it was cold the girl was shivering and that one other guy not in a relationship with her opened his arms and held the girl to keep her warm I looked away and stared at the guy on the motorcycle while he talked but I couldn t get that out of my head even as it continued for a minute When I got back to the car I put my head down wanting to just disappear My anger and sadness was overwhelming partly from being unable to have a one on one connection with that girl and her hugging the guy was burned into my mind which brought more shit from my past flooding forward When I got home I sent her a message saying I shouldn t have agreed to that group sitting that it was extremely painful for me The next day when I went to draw at the coffee shop that guy with the motorcycle never showed up I could barely look the girl in the face and I sent more texts about how miserable I felt but there was no response until closer to the end of the day My depression from opening up was getting extremely bad Once again the responses she had were some of the kindest responses I ve ever received When I got home I had more conversation with her and I broke down because of her kind responses and her struggles in life were relatable Her kindness had brought my depression down and done more than any doctors or medications were ever able to I told her you helped me so I m going to help you I offered to help her pay the rent as a thank you for being so damn kind and bring me back from a bad place She refused and told me she was trying not to cry after hearing that and seeing the money At this point was extremely embarrassed standing there around other patrons and some of the other works I didn t think she understood how much she just helped me perhaps saved me so I insisted and she refused again So partly in anger I left the money on the counter of the coffee shop telling her that someone was going to take it if she didn t I was fully intending to do that because her helped meant the world to me and I refused to take it back but she came up to me with the money and told me she hadn t earned it and refused to accept it My response was how she had done more than any doctors or meds had ever done before I finally gave in and took the money back I got to my car and sent her a message that it wasn t fair how I felt useless when she refused my help I felt even more miserable on my way home I think I probably freaked her out after that incident I sent more texts trying to talk to her wanting to just be with someone somewhere NOT STUCK IN MY FUCKING HEAD Either that night or the next I left the house She had stopped responding to my texts Sent multiple texts describing how I had no idea where my life was going I told her I wanted to leave and sit somewhere to watch the sun rise I didn t want to be alone I was fucking tired of constantly being stuck in my head I wanted to tell her that I wanted to be with her more than anything All I could muster was just statements of loneliness What transpired after was me driving in the night until the sun started coming up I took some pictures of the sunrise and sent them to her with the message Even though you didn t accept the money please accept this sunrise as my thank you I was so exhausted for the rest of my trip back home from being awake all night I sent one last message saying I was going to fall asleep and hoped that her day turned out to be great There hadn t been any responses for the past day something she never let drag on and I figured at this point she either got tired of reading my shit or was simply busy as she repeatedly implied when I asked about going to paint Regardless I felt an overwhelming love for this girl and as I fell asleep I actually was able to drift off without too much trouble When I woke up several hours later today there was still no response since the night before I decided to not brood over negative possibilities and just go draw something at the coffee shop and try to relax as best I could with this depression constantly there I got to the coffee shop and the girl was there she asked me if I d gotten some rest which implied that she had read everything I sent Further more she said nothing about the sun rise photos that I sent her All she mentioned was me getting some rest I put so much effort into getting the photos of that sunrise there was a drunk in front of me at one point swerving into oncoming traffic Depression kicked in heavily and I ordered something before sitting down and drawing trying to tune out everything around me The two guys that joined us at the diner were working there today as well Through out the day I could hear the of them laughing and picked out several comments making fun of me I removed the girl from my contacts so she wouldn t have to see any more depressing things from me and I m sure there s not going to be any painting with someone else I felt myself shrinking further and further inwards Smaller smaller smaller nothing just not wanting to be here anymore I wrote in my sketchpad You asked me if I got rest that told me you read the messages I had to piece two and two together that I was talking to myself I removed you from my contacts so you don t have to read my stuff any more I thought the sunrise photos were nice If you care please speak to me in person Show me through your actions I let you in Invite me out ask me to hang out show me you care I want to cry right now but I feel a painful emptiness inside no tears just sadness Tired and sick,high,high

"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day",high,high

Coyote in a bear trapIn September I attempted to jump a foot bridge after driving six hours to reach a bridge high enough to kill me upon impact over water I wanted to die of internal injuries less of a clean up My partner at the time cheated on me while I was in the hospital recovering and then lied to me even though he was publicly chatting with the person in question and had them plastered on all their social media I hate my state I hate the room I m in I have no room at all They put me on lithium and klonopin and the only thing it did was curb my impulse to commit suicide sleep hours a day and turn my piss orange despite all the water I was drinking I finally started taking testosterone after waiting almost five years instead having to watch my greedy motherfucker of a father die of stage cancer lest I hurt the dead s feelings After a few weeks on testosterone I had a scare in which they gave me the wrong needles retracting ones and I went to the ER with the thought I had a needle lodged into my leg On top of out of state medical bills I also have instate ones and now ones coming in for a needle that was never fucking there My insurance spiked its rates another as a big fuck you happy new year to me Luckily since I left my job after telling my boss I was suicidal and losing hours of paid time off I am now on medicaid whatever it is for young people My therapist and my psychologist don t take it though so I ve stopped taking my medications Mostly because all I fucking do is sleep It smells like absolute shit every time I leave my house and have to travel from point A to B in this god forsaken area the jobs are pathetic with pathetic pay and wouldn t give me any meaning to life except another step closer to a heart attack I feel enormously excluded from my friends ever since my transition started to show more I m not invited out anymore nobody talks to me and everyone says to just reach out but when I do I focus on them and say I m all good I would drug myself heavier and drive back out but my piece of shit car couldn t make it having been in and out of the shop more than four times in less than two months once I was out of the hospital and doing ubereats for shit pay I m filled with hate and despite all the shit I ve overcome from childhood neglect and abuse to watching my father die and not feeling shit or dropping a single tear while I watched or at his wake stalking ex s finally starting my transition I just no longer feel like it s worth it anymore I m taking up oxygen and only making the weight of the world worse Nobody wants me around except for the money I inherited I want to end it but I can t work up the guts to do it I wish there was a simpler method If I went for it again I financially and emotionally could not risk failure I want to become nothing and cease to exist I m tired of this plane I m tired of getting punched in the fucking face every time I try to open a door I m tired of being the outsider the white elephant in the room just because I m trying to be happy All it s doing is making everyone around me feel terrible and walk away despite my attempts to just be happy and encourage them because I m fucking sick of being alone I m alone now and I ve always been alone I don t foresee it changing I just need to get it off my chest because no one else will listen or rather I won t let them listen I don t want to worry them but at the same time I m trying to scream out for someone to come and help me I ve sacrificed so much for others and I ve gotten shit in return So as a coyote stuck in a bear trap do I wait for the hunter to come and kill me get attacked in some new buttfuck way by someone I decide to trust because I m so lonely or do I chew my leg off and bleed to death on my own terms I have no purpose I see no purpose Except for going to school just to probably fail like my father said I would or end up in debt up to where the noose is I hate this world There s wonderful people in it I believe a lot of people are inherently good but I m just a cancer clinging onto it,high,high

Paranoid verbally abused heart racing racing thoughts I have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder That basically means that I sometimes have problems controlling my mood or my way of thinking isn t aligned with reality sometimes So I was invited to dinner with my family for Passover and everything was all fine and dandy Then everyone left and we said our goodbyes I helped my mom with the table and some other cleaning around the kitchen I asked if she needed anymore help and she said no In response I asked if I could use the upstairs massage chair and she said ok So I went upstairs unbothered for about minutes to use the chair Keep in mind that I wasn t bothering anyone and was minding my own business No harm no foul The chair has a timer on it so that I know how much time remains At around minutes left my mom s husband stepfather whatever you want to call it comes upstairs to switch it off and he starts to belittle me with his words how this is his house and that I need his permission to use it So I left and walked downstairs away from him but he just wouldn t shut up like a broken record I went to the kitchen and followed soon after I asked mom if she needed some help and NOW she said that her husband helped her out AFTER she specifically told me that she didn t need anymore help Then I continued to distance myself from him and still no talking He s like You can be seen but not heard I understand if a grown up tells that to a child but I m here Don t I have a right to defend myself if I am being verbally or physically abused even if it means expressing my point of view with a shaky voice I told him ENOUGH but he still continues to talk I m not a little kid I got the point minutes ago and he still gabbers on and on and on Then I go upstairs to the second floor of the house to get my belongings and leave But he prevents me by blocking the doorway and still rambles on I m telling you he REALLY knows how to piss someone off Then after I grab my things and head toward the door he has the audacity to extend his hand to say bye All I do is walk past him put on my slippers and leave on my bicycle In the middle of all the arguments and the created tension my mom continued to defend him Like WTF I didn t do anything to anybody and if he didn t want me to use it he should have said so from the get go So I m seriously going to consider an ultimatum either mom divorces him or I will follow through with my suicide I just can t continue to live in fear like this I thought he would change but I was just being delusional Last time I checked it was also my mom s house and she has lived there longer than he has He moved in with her back in but she has lived there for over years stretching way back into the s I m telling you right now if I don t commit suicide my paranoid thoughts will lead me to believe that he will come to my apartment and threaten to kill me I am only miles away from where they live because my mom helped me with an apartment close to her I guess for protection He can at any time take the card to the community open the door to the building and unlock my front door The problem with him is that he likes to pursue things till the very end It s always one sided in his case I don t say anything but he just talks and talks to no end The things he does to empower himself is really sick and I m the one with the disorder Never ending verbal abuse and condescending tone with him I am seriously considering filing a restraining order against him I have never filed a restraining order against anyone but he might be the first The problem is it takes time to make it official and the decision is tentative because they have to hear out not only my side of the story but his as well I m worried that the court might take his side over mine and revoke my attempt to issue the restraining order I don t want to wait to be physically injured to use that as evidence to justify my support for the restraining order He might be married to my mom and live in the same household as her but that doesn t give him the right to treat me the way he does And who knows how he treats my mom behind closed doors I m know I m repeating myself but it has to be said I know I was a guest in my mom s home but I m no stranger and I wasn t disturbing anybody If anything it was like my presence wasn t even in the house until you actually came into the room That s how quiet I was Typing some of this out in writing in my quiet apartment has helped calm my mood a little bit but I am still feeling highly anxious about the situation I don t provoke anyone and I mind my own business Don t start nothing and there won t be nothing I live by that motto P S I flipped him the bird yesterday while I was trying on new clothes after he told me to suck it in It s not just HOW he said it but the WAY he said it with a smug look on his face and arrogant tone He was obviously referring to my stomach I have body fat and I have a flat stomach with a little bit of fat around the sides but not much abs Regardless he just HAS to talk shit just to feel better about himself The things he does to boost his self esteem,high,high

I can t take this no more the agony is killing me LONG STORY SHORT So my name is Alfred Florin and I have been suffering from ocd pure o since I was I am now From a very young age I shook hands with Ocd and had anxiety problems but they were not a big deal it was present or days then it would go away without a huge effort When I was the sickness struck hard and I felt its presence so hard like it was a possession I will get there too but now let s continue the story My first ocd encounter was when I have stepped on a guy s foot when I was I guess You may be wondering what s wrong with that or what that means Well in Romania there is a urban myth it goes like this if you step on someone s foot and that person doesn t step on your back your mother dies Well there were many people around me cause it was the mayor elecrion that day and after I have stepped on that guy s foot I couldn t figure where he went cause it happened fast and then he disappeared in the crowd in an instant Well when I got home I thought at the fact that my mom could be dead cause I have stepped on that guy s foot I wasn t really scared or anything just a little worried I know it s stupid even for a year old but yeah Well I guess hours passed and I started thinking in that obsessive way that my mom will die and etc bad thoughts my chest started burning and everything I would say to fight it back I couldn t get me to believe that it s not real I have started crying and the pain made me feel like my life was ruined Well it passed really soon I guess the next day I was kind of ok I DID NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT After that experience till age I had various exeperiences like that one but it did not bother me on the long run Let me give some examples I was thinking at biomechanics and had some repetitive body movements I couldn t stop from doing them until I felt like I had hit the right spot or the movement was the right one I once sae a really f cked up thing on a website it was a soup made of a fetus Well after I saw that my mind started telling me that I would enjoy it and would like to eat it And I couldn t stop from imagining myself from eating it even though I hated these images it was pure hell cause I was a religious person and that made me feel like I had let God down Whenever I would go to church I would imagine Jesus and Mary having sex and I just couldn t stop thinking and I would get images and mind movies and I would just leave church feeling like CRAP It made me feel like I was such a bad person and I was actually crippled by these thoughts but it went off really fast and it did not affect my life on the long run I repeat I had periods when I would feel bad and depressed and felt a ache in my chest and it was just like my soul hurt not my chest I was really emotional all of a sudden I would get scared easily and cry really fast Let me talk to you abot age I had a friend at that did not believe in Jesus and we would argue all day long about religous stuff and I was explaining to him thing every single day about hours a day every damn day and that caused me a lot of stress but I really wanted to help him and I felt like it was my duty to stop his tears with the help of God Well one day I was sitting at my computer and one of his questions about god popped into my head I have tried to answer it myself but I couldn t get the answer right so I have seesrched it on google saw different responses but guess what not a single answer made me feel ok I felt a thirst of truth and the next minutes my chest lighted up little by little and the pain was getting stronger I was searching and searching for an answer and guess what That question transformed into questions per second In my mind I felt a tornado of questions making my soul and my brain hurt like no other thing in this world That day I have spent it wandering the streets cause I just couldn t sit still My chest and soul were on fire and my mind was full of questions I was walking like a mad man and looking straight into nothingness while while walking and trying to give myself a answer to all of the questions while slowly strating to realize that I was going to hell cause I started doubting God and its works and that made my chest EXPLODE and I have bursted into tears and the biggest and badeest panick attack I have ever experienced and the first My mom came home from work and I was keep telling her that my soul aches and I do not know what to do she was distressed by my situation but she was thinking that it s only a teenage thing and it will pass Nightime came and the pain and question were just king of gone but they were omnipresent Before bed I was a disaster I got down on my knees and prayed like tomorrow was the end of days but the next day the same thing happened It got to the point that I had to sleep with my mom and listen to the radio all night long and all day long just not to hear BRAIN THAT WAS TELLING ME THAT I WAS GOING TO HELL AND I HAD IMAGES OF ME BURNING IN HELL GLUED TO MY MIND AND SOUL Well It went like this for months until my father came home from abroad and went with me to a psychiatrist and thing went ok for a while but that psychiatrist did not care about me and it took years for me to understand that it was wrong seeing her She gave me the same pills all these years and we never did therapy but I had a fear of leaving the treatment behind and leaving my psychiatrist cause I thought no one would understand and I continued on for years the fifth year I was off pils off seeing a psychiatrist etc while I was seeing the psychiatrist everything was bad but it was bearable My life was shit but I could cope with it In these years i have been through all of the branches of OCD I had HOCD fobias Religious ocd blah blah I guess I had tasted all of it The Hocd wrecked my life but I went through it like a champ This last year the fifth I met Laura and my new ocd chapter began RETROACRIVE JEALOUSY IS MY PRIMARY ENEMY NOW It s not like I dont have the scars of my other ocd episodes I still was depreseed angry and full of pain when I met her but one thing I wasn t Hopeless I had a hope that I would get better I have met her march she was different she had sexual some really colorful sexual experiences and she seamed slutty She was talking to me about her sexual past and black men in her life and how she cheated on her ex cause she was horny and stuff We kissed one night and I saw something in her something special even if she talked like she did but I like her as a person she was funny and she had a nice personality We were toghether and one day I just couldn t stop thinking at these men she has been with and how she talked to me about them and my ocd started kicking after months in the reltionship my ocd came in and ruined us in a way I was unabe to please her sexualy unable to kiss her It got to the point where I wanted to break up because of it And i was at inch of doing it but we got through it and we were kind of ok not good but ok Well we were toghether i was getting ready for an exam in august when I found put that she cheated o me in june with her ex Alin several times in that month and they have been talking from some time I guess they started talking in april after I have found that in august I forgave her and was strict with her for a month so she would understand that she did wrong and it wrecked our relationship In that period an anger lighted up in me ai started talking to my ex too but nothing romantic or so just random talk I did not touch her or anything I have stopped talking to her at the middle of september cause I feel like that anger wasn t doing me any good and I need to forgive her Well everthing went really good until I found out that she has been in a club one night on the date of of september and she went with her best friend that recently got into a relationship guess with who the dude with she cheated on her ex Alin with he s called Paul she went to the club with Paul her best friend Andreea and Teodor a dude wich she has been seeing while she was in a relationship with her ex That night she got drunk she did drugs and she asked Teodor why did we stop seeing eachother and when he left she asked are you leaving my here with these crazies paul and andreea at the end of the night she was spitted on by a dude cause she intervened while he was shouting at Paul that he wants to fight him and Laura said fight me the he spitted her Teodor said Laura asked him to come back and take her back home to chill but she said that it is not true She lied to me about many things and I don t know what to believe I forgave her but after that night My ocd started wrecking my life again After I found this I contacted my ex and slept with her put of anger I did it with her twice and I regret it because I did not feel anything for her Laura found and she got over it Problem is we are ok with a new start though I don t trust her like some time ago and I can t stop asking her questions and details about her past and she cheating me how she did it why minor details anything I get an answer i feel better for an hour then it kicks again and I can t stop getting mental movies and images and hearing things about her and other man ablut her and Teodor Alin Paul and etc I really need to get back on track but it seems really hard I have told her that in order for this to work she need to stop talking to other men going to club stol doing this stop doing that etc is it right What am I doing I will go to a specialist who really cares but until then Please help me every word matters please tell me if my relationship is worth anything Would you forgive what would you do I just cant stop getting images and my brain tells me that she betrayed me twice not just once with Alin but twice with that night in the club and that I am not good enough and my self esteem is wrecked I can t even go for a walk cause everytime I do I see someone more muscular or more attractive than me in any way my ocd teels me that my girlfriend will like him cause he is better or that she look at him and admires him ai get really jealous and I lock myself into a shell Sometimes I feel like I am just like a little a wounded boy who just wants to be understood and loved and its hard because we live in a really plastic and harsh world Nobody cares about feeling no more and we all chase the money like hell Sorry for the grammar mistakes if you spot some but I am not well Thanks for reading,high,high

Do therapist ever help I am contemplating seeing a therapist but I don t actually know what I will get out of it I think I am kind of depressed right now but for the most part me wanting to kill myself was not because of depression It s a logical decision based on my own reasoning I think a lot of people see a therapist for medication if I don t want medication is it mostly a waste of time I guess I want someone to listen and maybe surprise me with an insight angle I have not thought of I am also afraid I ll be sent to a hospital if I am being too honest I m getting better but I m really just taking it one day at a time The future scares me and I don t have motivation to do anything other than sitting at home after work To me it s actually more comforting to think about dying than to live,high,high

Falling apartI m and about to drop out of university I m simply far too depressed and anxious to cope with the work load I worked so hard to get into this uni in order to get away from my narcissistic father but now it seems that I will have to move back in with him I have no work experience or skills whatsoever The only thing I ve got going for me is the fact I got straight A grades in my A levels not sure what the US equivalent is I m in the UK but that doesn t mean anything to employers I took a year out before coming to university and did do some volunteering in a charity shop but I spent most of my time in the stock room so it wasn t very useful In this economy it seems that someone with no experience and mental health issues is not going to get far at all When I think of my future it seems incredibly bleak and disappointing I ve been on an SSRI since Thursday but it s just making me feel even worse and the side effects are awful I had therapy last Wednesday but I find it hard to talk about my problems Thankfully I have my mother and grandmother back home who are hugely supportive but I can t live with them for various reasons I have no friends back home though I hate my hometown It s not far from a major city but it s still small and incredibly boring Everyone from my old high school is moving on with their lives and I m at rock bottom I have no confidence to make new friends The only social contact I have is hook ups but it never progresses beyond sex Nobody in their right mind would date a loser like me anyway I would honestly rather die than face a lifetime of unemployment misemployment The only thing stopping me is the guilt of what it would do to my mum I m her only child and it would destroy her As I say though I really can t face my current situation I can t think of any other reason to go on,high,high

"Ok I'm a 22 year old guy. In 2014 I began to improve my diet. I just stopped eating junkfood, sugar, no sodas, and just water and 3 solid meals a day. Eventually a few weeks after that I felt like a god like I woke up for the first time. Before this my mood was worse and so was my diet. Anyway my libido was never better, I lost fat, physical strength seemed to increase, mood very balanced and energy was great! I wasn't even workingout then. Even on days were I didn't sleep to good I still felt phenomenal. I enjoyed doing things in the yard and my irritablility was nonexistent, but occasionlly I'd eat sugar, or drink a beer here and there but thats it. This lasted to about thanksgiving last year. I lost selfcontrol and fell a slave to the holiday foods. Especially Christmas. So yeah I picked up pounds and my libido decreased and my energy but my mood was decent still. This last till about early March this year. So last month I cleaned my diet up or tried to. Heres the thing, I just got a job in March and pretty much I leave early in the morning and come back late at night, and I have to repeat next morning. I wasn't able eat too much. I still ate 3 times a day but I didnt have time to eat a large amount. Ever since then, my mood has shot down, my libido has gone down, now I'm irrationally angry and depressed for no reason! Homicidal thoughts and occasionally suicidal. Like I wanted to drive this lady of the road this morning for cutting me off and flipping me off and I didn't even care she had a kid with her, but luckily I maintained control and I got over it quickly. My mood bounces like crazy, I can be happy talking with a friend and then after they leave hours later, I'm depressed, then I'm wanting to kill someone, then I see something funny or distracting that puts me in a temporarily good mood. I already had an episode of me yelling outside earlier because I didn't want to break anything in my home. Last week I wanted to attack some guy just from snoring on the bus, this is a new type of anger for me. My muscle mass has decreased, I feel a bit weaker, somedays or moments I feel lethargic, hating life and fatigue others I don't, even if I sleep good I'll still feel tired even if I wake up with a good mood. I do notice I get a temporary mood boost while and after I'm eating but feel fatigued sometime after. I was thinking maybe I wasn't eating enough because I know restricting calories can cause a few issues. I changed jobs, now I'm working with my uncle who has a much better work schedule. I'm putting a bit more food on my plate thinking I'd go back to my old self, but no help at all. I don't know if I'm still not eating enough, I did increase the amount of food though. I'm not sure if this is a mental issue or a nutritional one. I'm not going through anything that would cause me to be this angry for no reason. Nothing in my life has changed except my eating habit which I'm fixing. I'm sleeping way better, and again no junk or sugar. Even years ago when I ate like crap, I never experienced this. If this not a lack of calorie issue, then WHY now? Why all of a sudden do I feel a drop in everything, I mean back in 2014 I fixed my diet felt fantastic, I get a little loose with it, try to fix it again now this is happening. I'm confused. From what I remember, I don't think I'm eating much less than I was last year, also I'm less social, like I'd rather stay in than hangout. I never was a huge social person but I still enjoyed the occasional outing. Sorry if this is long, again I'm just extremely lost here and confused as to what the source of this could be. Could being overweight cause this?? I've been obese before and it's not a thing new to me. Thanks.",low,medium

I desperately need help Hello I m a years old male college student I don t know where to begin I ll spare you my family problems I got over them I don t even know how to properly describe my situation I have no girlfriend nor I had many in the past I had two relationships that lasted less than a week when I was and the last one ended badly Six months ago I found out that my girlfriend of five months was cheating on me with two guys at the same time throught the whole period she spent with me She told me she felt pity for me and didn t want to dump me but she didn t really like me I fell as down as I ve ever fallen before as soon as she said that to me Even though I m socially akward I am also a good liar and I managed to make everyone believe I was fine confident and manly I didn t want my friends to feel bad for me so I dealt with my feelings when I was alone and faked confidence when I was with them My male friends constantly ask me for advices on how to be more like me because they think that I don t talk a lot because I m mysterious and other utter bullcrap like that They make me look cooler than I really am The reality is that I m a messed up guy who can t even talk without doing something cringyin and says that girls are not his priority to look cool just so that people don t wonder why he doesn t have one I cry myself to sleep everynight I usually sleep one to two hours everynight because of all the shit that goes on in my head Drinking wine has helped me with the thoughts and the insomnia but I ve recently stopped because I m scared of going down the alcoholic route which would make me feel even more pathetic These six months have been the darkest of my life so far All of my male friends have a girlfriend talk to me about how happy they are and I have to pretend I m happy for them In reality I just wish they all lost whatever they have out of jelousy I ve dumped all of my female friends because I m slowly becoming obsessed with not being friendzoned by girls Whenever an attractive friend of mine came up to me for advice I instantly felt like shit because she is treating me like a female friend Even newly met girls do that They don t even find me interesting enough to even consider dating me and straight up see me as an emotional dumpster The worst thing is that I actually try not to make myself view like that by avoiding giving advices and being the classic nice guy I am so not interesting that they fucking put me in the friendzone The last drop was today I ve been chatting with this girl for a couple of days she seemed interested since she always initiated contact touched me asked me very personal questions and in general her body language was telling me that she was interested I followed my usual line of thoughts by faking confidence and pretending my life was all good and interesting also because I have no interest in boring a stranger to death with my personal problems Today she hugged me and told me she loves me like a fucking brother I ve managed to put myself in the friendzone in not even a fucking week I don t know I just don t know She is now texting me and I don t want to answer her because I know she wants a friendship out of me and I do not want to give her that My pride is no more I don t want to talk about it with my friends because the way they see me is probably the only one good thing about my life I m also supposed to go to a party tonight and she is going to be there I think I ll stay home I don t know,high,high

At what point is it better to die than to live this way I ve been struggling with this condition for months now with no sign of recovery of my waking life my mind is blank completely devoid of mental activity It is a constant struggle of mine to maintain any form of awareness Additionally my short term and long term memory function at nearly amnesiac levels and my ability to focus and simply put think are at an atrociously low level My brain has a complete absence of mental activity This subjective experience is hard for me to quantify or explain but almost all the time my mind is completely blank like a zombie In a sense I m mentally catatonic like someone gave a computer the wattage of a light bulb just enough energy to give the appearance of awareness Every moment I m awake is a struggle to maintain some form of consciousness When not stimulated by loud music video games or the constant novelty of the Internet I zone out My mind is completely empty there is no thought whatsoever This brings me to my memory issues both short and long term trying to remember what I did as recently as yesterday requires a huge amount of effort Sometimes I ll be able to remember scattered details about the day before like where I had lunch but memories are scattered and non linear Trying to remember something that happened a day ago a week ago or a year ago feels the same There is just no clarity of memory I feel perpetually spaced out my mind feels foggy as though I m in a dream or under the influence of some substance I feel awake yet not awake sleepy although im physically fully awake I have trouble with social interaction because I just don t know what to say most of the time Frequently i have to stop and think of a decent response just to look normal because otherwise there d be nothing I have to say The times I do have something to speak up on I often stutter because I have trouble finding the right words to use or put them together in a sentence There are times where I ll just mentally blank out mid utterance and have not a clue what I wanted to say next I feel like I m just existing in this one moment with no past no connection to the present and no future I d rather die than live the rest of my life as this empty shell of a person,high,high

Why is the milk gone Why did you forgot to buy milk Well that s the interesting question See you were going to get some on the way home yesterday but then you remember that you need some bread as well so u went to bread house however the alcohol store was on the way to the bread house So you went there first just because you been doing quite a lot of drinking alone and if by recently you mean last year and the have this new alcohol apple flavor vodka Which was pretty cool and you brought and then forgot to buy milk so really the milk is gone because of vodka but really you only went to buy vodka cuz it s been a cloudy day and you wanted to cheer yourself up a bit and it s only been a cloudy day because of the temperature differential brought on by east moving winds and pressure fluctuations So really the milk is gone because of the weather but the weather is only there because of the atmosphere which formed about billion years ago result of gas escaping from earths interior so the milk is gone because of the earth But the earth is only there because a gas cloud condensed into the sun and the solar system a few billion years ago and all of that came from the Big Bang billion of years before that so really the milk is gone because space and time materialized out of nothing billion years ago So if that the case Did the universe always knew that billion years when it exploded formed into galaxies and stars and they gave rise to planets and planets developed ecosystem single cell life complex organisms humans human society domestication of cows the invention of coffee milk in coffee fridges and finally you that you would eventually run out of milk billion years later Well maybe If You re playing snooker or pool or whatever and you hit a ball at a certain angle and speed and if you have a good enough computer you can say where the ball are going to go right It s all predetermined If you take the same shot times the outcome will be the same times well if the Big Bang happens time over just the way it it did billion years ago would you run out of milk a times billion later And doesn t that mean that you re life is already determined Like day of your birth and death was already predicted the moment came into being and everything has to happen in a certain way just that way just like a pool game No definitely not We ve got free will right I mean just because the universe is made of of atoms bumping into each other that have to act in a certain way based on what happened before and just because your brain is made up of atoms that doesn t mean they have to do the same thing and all are the part of the same system you can still just decided to do stuff right BECAUSE IF NOT THEN WE ARE JUST BALLS IN A COSMIC GAME OF POOL WITH NO FREE WILL AT ALL MEANING WE RE JUST ROBOTS CAUGHT IN A DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM WITH JUST ILLUSION OF CHOICE BUT REALLY HAVING NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER OVER OUR LIFE DELUDING OUR SELF INTO THINKING WE RE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT TO ALL THE OTHER ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT WOULD MEAN YOU VE NEVER MADE A REAL CHOICE AND YOU NEVER WILL AND WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO NEXT IN LIFE ISN T A DECISION AT ALL BUT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE S NO POINT TO EVER DOING ANYTHING EVER AGAIN BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS PREDECIDED AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND LIFE AND LIFE IS COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS AND EMPTY AND FUCK IT FUCK MILK black coffee is fine,medium,low

I Wish I Had Never Been BornI wish my parents had one child not two I m very lonely Almost every day I cry myself to sleep because of how lonely I feel I have a lot of things to be thankful for I have food and shelter Clean drinking water But I m very lonely It s almost like a physical pain I feel like an alien on Earth I go through about my day and enact certain behaviours that will make me appear like a normal member of society But I m deeply broken inside I am turning in two months and I think I have led a good life years is a long time I never thought I would see my th birthday I have always been a loner Alone I have trouble making friends I had a few friends since high school but we ve drifted apart ever sense I used to struggle a lot with loneliness and I ve put myself out there Talked to people Worked on being positive Joined clubs Tried new things Get new jobs But everything is external I know that everything I do it is an act I will write two letter when I end it One of them is for my dad I want to thank him for supporting me even though I didn t turn out well I want to tell him that it is for the best and the end is inevitable I want to thank him and tell him that when it comes to it my departure is not something to grieve over because I would never amount to anything in life It is better to end it now before I become a bigger burden In a way it is the best time to end it In my letter I hope to convey to my family that my existence should have never happened in the first place I have a darkness within myself and I m always very very lonely I have no one There was no other reason that I was brought to this world I have cried many days and nights over this decision but I think it s for the best I have nothing to offer to the world I am nothing I used to cry and long for someone to love and hold me but I ve finally reached peace with the realization that there is reason that I will never find it I m very grateful for all the gestures of kindness I ve received in this life They meant a lot to me The reason that I ve always been a loner all my life is because I am not a person who can have it Why would anyone love and care about me The reason that is that I should have never been born I m really glad that I was able to make something of my life that would make me somewhat a productive member of society I m very lucky But I have to end it Because this is it I m sorry for the pain that my family will go through But I hope they understand that I ve arrived at this decision because it is the right thing If I were to prolong my time on this Earth there is nothing else for me other than being a greater burden This is a good thing I m glad that I ve experienced my th birthday It was good years is a long time Thank you,high,high

My friend is slowly getting worse and has made threats to kill himself I m not sure what steps to take Hi everyone Best wishes to everyone and I m so sorry that anyone has to go through what you all have gone through I myself have thankfully been able to get out of my own depression and am now in a better place My friend however just seems to be getting worse He s only Just turned a few months ago actually Lately he s been making threats I wouldn t call them threats but the word that I m looking for escapes me and saying things like if my dad s gun case wasn t locked I don t know what I would do and things of that nature very very openly to me He said once that he might do it soon if things don t get better I ask him why and he says I just can t deal with it anymore He s been very reckless lately When he was younger at around or so he got his hands on some strong prescription pain killers and benzodiazepines which he stole from family and his parents Ever since then he s loved the idea of getting more He hasn t tried any pharmaceutical opiates in years but I guess for some people the feeling just can t ever be forgotten Then he found out about Kratom Kratom is great and for responsible users it s a godsend I use it myself every once in a while and it s fantastic Great for pain and sleep Ever since he got some he s started abusing it It started out as something he did every once in a while but within a week he had said f it and started using it every time something went wrong in his life He uses it as a crutch if you will One day I passively mentioned phenibut and then he suddenly ordered some I deeply regret that He abuses this now too Phenibut is a nootropic that has anti anxiety characteristics It s notorious for its rebound anxiety and withdrawal after being abused I honestly don t know how much he s used of Phenibut but he s had some pretty bad anxiety now that he says he s off of it Now he has been talking about getting some strong pharmaceutical opiates again I tried to tell him that that road might not lead him to happiness and that he could prossibly be worse in the long run but he just retorted with isn t the goal of life to have as much fun as possible and be as happy as possible I tried to reason with him and say no the goal is the be fully happy with the situation you re in without the use of substances I may have been wrong it s fine to seek help from substances But he hasn t seen a psychiatrist or anything so at this point he s self medicating and poorly at that He s always struggled with depersonalization derealization as well And he says it s been getting worse In my opinion I think the substances he s been testing with may be making him worse in the long run He doesn t seem to want help though There s other stuff that I won t list here one of which I think could possibly be messing up his brain s dopamine system but he doesn t even want to try stopping it I mean if it could help and you re pretty desparate why not But I m not him and he s probably in a completely different headspace than I m in Also he has a LOT of anxiety stemming from the fact that he ll need to be going to college soon and honestly I feel like he s still very much a kid inside His parents gave him the option of waiting one year but he saw his other friend just decide not to go to college after getting a well paying job during his gap year Reading through this post I m pretty sure that I m not looking at all of this from the right perspective It s been a long time since I was in a situation similar to his so I m having trouble putting the shoes on the other foot so I apologize,high,high

I can t tell anyone the real reason I m suicidal I was recently put in a psych ward for the suicidal because I was stupidly dropping major hints that I planned to kill my self in hopes that I could ask for help without destroying my pride When I was put in there my family blamed it on Prozac seeing as one of its side effects is suicidal thoughts I ve talked to therapist after therapist and I told them all the same thing But I haven t told anyone why I really wanted to kill myself Not even my closest friends The real reason I wanted to die was because of a girl I know it sounds stupid but hear me out I had known this girl for years and have had a HUGE crush on her from the second I was introduced to her Many years went by she had moved back and forth a few times When she came back this time I confessed my feelings for her She said the feelings were mutual but she wasn t ready for a relationship yet seeing as she had just gotten out of a bad relationship I made sure to let her know that I understood and planned to respect that About a month goes by and she is very flirty with me Touching me writing me little notes making fun of eachother sending me hearts etc However just when I think I m getting somewhere she gets back together with her ex They were all over eachother Their social media s filled with posts about eachother and going on and on about eachother The works Now not only was I fucked sideways in this situation but she still keeps me just close enough so that these feelings can t go away And she still does all the flirty things she did when she was single She is the only girl I ve ever had feelings this strong for I can t help but love her But after a month and a half of this It didn t sting as bad it just made me very depressed and sick I was starting to get over my suicidal feelings The psych ward really helped me realize a lot However all of those feelings rushed back after we hung out We grabbed a pizza watched a movie made eachother laugh and went for a walk in the autumn leaves She looked absolutely amazing She made me happy The entire time I was with her I didn t have a single worry Nothing else mattered It felt like I was in heaven It was then I realized how much I actually love her She told me she loved me but it felt so hollow as if it barely meant anything to her I just felt so empty knowing how disposable I am We talk often and she says she considers me her best friend I obviously play along but she means far more to me than any friend ever has We talk almost every day we hangout at least once a week and she still acts as flirty as she used to but I know it ll never go anywhere It s sad to say but I put all my eggs in one basket and somebody stole it I know I sound really pathetic but that s why I lied to everyone I m ashamed that she is the reason I wanted to end my life Don t get it wrong I have a life outside of her I have friends and family and hobbies and things to be proud of but it feels like none of that matters without her I m truly a piece of shit but I guess that s why I m saying this to strangers on the internet,high,high

NumbIt s really not that I want to die But I don t want to live either Shit just feels pointless again I mean I ve felt like this before and in the end I m only seventeen maybe I will grow out of it or something but I m just scared that maybe I won t Maybe I will feel like this forever That I will keep waking up just to take a shot go to school drink even more and then sleep again I don t even enjoy cuddling with my dog anymore That s been the thing that kept me somewhat hopeful the last times that there was one thing I could feel happy about But even that is gone The last feeling I tried to hold onto left me I can pretend that I am feeling shit that s never been the problem but it feels like there s only two feelings I really have Loneliness and numbness It also gets harder to fit in I feel hated in school I m just that weird kid that tries to be liked without having any qualities to actually be likable And I hoped that writing this would help would help me feel less numb but even though I am literally tearing up I don t feel the pain I am still numb And I want to stop it but I don t know how I am just lost And also very drunk elseway I probably wouldn t be writing this I am in therapy btw and I take antidepressants so I know I shouldn t be drinking but ah well Alcohol works better than both of the above,high,high

Last night I had a dream where this guy was trying to get me to cheat on my s o who is currently abroad I used to be a shit person unloyal bitch before I met my bf but even in my dream I knew it was not okay and it wasn t what I wanted even though it was just a dream and meant nothing I didn t even hesitate saying No I love someone else even after he kept asking several times It somehow made me really see how much I m actually capable of loving someone and being able to be committed without fearing it all There had been a few incidents where guys would try to push my boundaries irl while I was in that relationship with my bf I always ignored it used a stern no and walked away and I didn t put much thought of it But again the dream even giving me the opportunity to cheat without anyone knowing I really didn t want to regardless I am pretty happy with who I have It s a new concept for me to feel it seems sort of wimpy and stupid considering I should ve been more knowledgeable of it already and generally a better person I just wanted to share however,low,low

Worried about someone i met at works bar I work at a hotel bar and this evening had a chap come back after being out for the day drinking Though he had clearly had a fair bit to drink he was mostly still in sound mind for the first few hours of our chat It quickly became apparent that that he was carrying a lot of baggage PTSD childhood abuse and a few other things He is the father of someone i went to school with about years ago Have not seen any of them in that time appart from passing in the street so he felt like he could open up a little when telling me the stories but also was very stern that the conversation was between us two and no one else He spoke about the several doctors and psychologists he had visited over the years being of no help as they just kept trying to get him to move on He then described someone under his watch being killed while explaining that something like that cannot be forgotten or put out of mind I did not so much speak but rather listened to his story and what he had to say Honestly i was very overwhelmed and could not even begin to know how to reply and he mentioned several times that he had considered jumping off a near by bridge or walking infront of a train several times in the last year I think much of this is due to him having no one he feels he can talk to at home and clearly feels he is a burden on his wife over the last years He left his phone number and said that the chat had made him feel the best he had felt in months and would like to chat again Here is the problem and i feel like utter scum even thinking this way but i do not have the time or the knowledge to possibly be on call for something like this and do not know what to do If i pass his number on or try to contact his family will it destroy any trust he may have when talking to people about this But at the same time just leaving it and hoping the it was the alcohol talking is not an option as he was able to have a well thought out talk Sorry if this is a bit of a mess its fairly early late in the morning and i am still at work any advise would help Thanks,high,high

Reviewing something everyday until I find something interesting day th day Topic Microcephaly one of the rarest disease If you have interesting topic please leave a comment Microcephaly is a condition where a baby s head is much smaller than expected During pregnancy a baby s head grows because the baby s brain grows Microcephaly can occur because a baby s brain has not developed properly during pregnancy or has stopped growing after birth which results in a smaller head size Microcephaly can be an isolated condition meaning that it can occur with no other major birth defects or it can occur in combination with other major birth defects Severe microcephaly is a more serious extreme form of this condition where a baby s head is much smaller than expected Severe microcephaly can result because a baby s brain has not developed properly during pregnancy or the brain started to develop correctly and then was damaged at some point during pregnancy Babies with microcephaly can have a range of other problems depending on how severe their microcephaly is Microcephaly has been linked with the following problems Seizures Developmental delay such as problems with speech or other developmental milestones like sitting standing and walking Intellectual disability decreased ability to learn and function in daily life Problems with movement and balance Feeding problems such as difficulty swallowing Hearing loss Vision problems These problems can range from mild to severe and are often lifelong Because the baby s brain is small and underdeveloped babies with severe microcephaly can have more of these problems or have more difficulty with them than babies with milder microcephaly Severe microcephaly also can be life threatening Because it is difficult to predict at birth what problems a baby will have from microcephaly babies with microcephaly often need close follow up through regular check ups with a healthcare provider to monitor their growth and development,low,low

I live in a country with strict covid restrictions and we are strongly encouraged to stay home. Dining in has been restricted and I have little excuses to go out besides saying I am going to a friend's house. My friends have been gracious enough to invite me over anytime I need to but my mother would make a lot of negative comments about me leaving the house in this pandemic and it just discourages me to do things/tell her that I want to go somewhere/ do something. I have been receiving negative reinforcements (snide remarks, talking behind your back, breathing down your neck parenting etc) since young and this has affected me a lot as a person and I have been trying to be a better person each day. I met a guy who loved me despite everything and tried to make me a better person too; he was my shelter and escape everytime my mum hits me with the negative shit. But recently he abandoned me and left me to fend for myself and he took the light away with him too. Today I signed up for a credit card and was nagged to no end by my mother, and was called stupid over something that I did my research for. And it hit me that things have always been like this since I was young. Everything I do is not right and everything I do is dumb and everything I do has to be controlled by her. And I am so drained. I have not cried like today in awhile; I know when it is a depressive cry. I need to leave this place and environment. I need to. Sliding back down the rabbithole",medium,medium

This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved part This has just happened to me today Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go bitch pleeassseee Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger It s not that I plan to kill myself but instantaneously I think in my head I want to kill myself and immediately next thought I would think OMG don t be stupid that s not going to happen That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent The problem here is now I don t really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone What happened today was I bitched to a friend at work via my personal email and their work email I do say friend because I m not venting to them because it s my best friend or anything it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work and isn t very trustworthy as you are about to find out I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment which had bits of people are lying to me again I want to kill myself I feel faint so forth Not the first time I told him that in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I ll self harm if I went outside and he did nothing Literally nothing He read it and didn t even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me I was literally just upstairs Anyways the point of that side story is that this is normal So back to the main story I wrote those emails early in the morning then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep After lunch my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police OK sure Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them The police came What they knew was Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I d self harm suicide and they were worried because I haven t sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive They have mixed in some truths with lies I sent an email true The bit where they make a big deal out of it a lie I had no phone calls or emails from them that day really they could ve contacted me if they wanted to However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it The point is I was fine I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day so the doctors didn t think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could ve done so against my will There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of care or worry who says they are doing things that they are not It s hard to tell most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn t right It s just better to trust your instincts People can let you down or betray your trust I m slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me someone with a history of mental illness seen a psychologist Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment but the police literally can t do anything else it s the doctors who decide Doctors at the hospital aren t going to just blindly listen to that story and going to the hospital doesn t mean that they ll keep you there against your will Why did my work place decide to lie I don t know They could be genuinely worried they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance It really doesn t matter They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves As for my friend I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing I honestly do believe if I died he d shrug it off I ve told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before but getting personal messages like whatsapp not just emails forward off to work Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm want to kill myself wanting them to watch me die wanting him to regret not helping me What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help He did that more than once actually At the same time he s pretending he s a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans He is like a human version of the workplace If I can kill myself I d make sure he gets haunted by it I used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more thinking I could get back at them,high,high

"I do not even know what to write here or where to start..Excuse for my English proficiency as its not my first language.For the past 5 years I had toxic parents and I have been in toxic relationships. My way of thinking about life, my will and reasoning were drastic and still are. The way I dealt with deppresion were drugs, cutting my wrist, risking life while walking on the edge of a building. A few years ago I tried to drown myself underneath the ice, hoping that I would not find the exit if I decided to live ( as I was almost drowning I found fisherman's hole through which I was able to break through and survive )I would not call myself dumb as I have created a few businesses (which failed eventually as I did not invest enough time and money) and now work as a programmer in a company which pays me good, but I failed my native language exams. I will not get my diploma and I will not enroll in the university. My mom recently went into psychosis which is not getting better. it is really hard to decide how I feel about that as I hated her most of my life, but we had our moments. My dad seems depressed too, I have two younger sisters and it is really hard to see him and I struggle to take care of them. I keep failing my driving exams. When taking them I start to feel really anxious and just stop the exam as my clutch leg starts ticking uncontrollably.I cannot stop thinking about suicide and my morality about it. I know that I have to support the family, live for my friends too, but it just overwhelms me.Now at nights I just drug myself until I pass out while listening to music and it is the only way I can keep my thoughts away from suicide. I have tried a few psychologist, they did not really help me. I do not know what to do. it is so hard to stay alive.I just wanted to, I dunno, share my pain or just talk to someone.

Nietzsche for the Interested and Depressed Let me begin by dispelling a common misconception Nietzsche is not a nihilist If you associate him with nihilism dear reader it may be easier for you to understand what I am about to say if you pretend that you have never heard the name of Friedrich Nietzsche I find that many individuals come to a point where they stop look around and realize that they are a mouse in a labyrinth hunting for cheese however not only do they seem to be losing the game but they don t quite see the point of even playing They find that everything around them is an false image So much phoniness surrounds them with no escape Then they look at themselves and find that they have nothing to live for Congratulations friend if this is you you have stumbled upon the dark truth of man You have made it half the way the way there but I feel you have one more conclusion to draw that will return purpose to your life Beginning with the arguments of Plato Socrates and other Greek philosophers the original purpose of man was to follow a telos a goal to seek the purest form of the self For these thinkers there was a pure form of justice of triangles of logic and of man that were concealed by images projected by the objects themselves and by culture and only through argumentation can one find these Forms in a sort of team effort This sort of thinking provides at the very least a basis for morals and is the foundation for the character we try to instill in children Remember even before you started school how your mothers tried to teach you to be honest and kind as though they were inherent characteristics of man Eventually people began to question the existence of these Forms such as Immanuel Kant Friedrich Nietzsche Joseph Conrad among others Each of them provided their alternatives to these forms Likewise you seeker of truth have found that the forms in and of themselves are lies and it is here you Nietzsche Conrad Holden Caufield and Hamlet have found common ground however it is time to move back from the abyss and find a role and participate in the grand play of this world Nietzsche provides a solution for this issue Beginning with the given that ALL morality is a fiction a construct of society rather than attempting to distinguish truth from fiction the distinction must be made between fiction and better fiction Fictions range from an appreciation of Mozart and the Golden Rule to playing hockey or going to the club But with no grounding for even this quest for fictions it begs the question Why bother with these fictions The answer is That is life A life consists of a collection of actions of doing of being of finding whatever interests you KNOWING THAT IT IS NOT TRUE Football for example consists men running about attempting to move a pigskin and tackling each other but millions of people have adopted this fiction and made the rules a part of their lives Conrad expresses the pursuit of better fictions as turning to work Work is any activity that produces a better understanding of the self and that provides joy While science has discovered that we are a bunch of atoms you can do nothing with that information Unless of course you are a biochemist I haven t expressed all that I would have liked due to homework that I ve been putting off please comment with questions comments hate love criticism and I will try to answer accordingly TL DR You may have realized that the truth is we are a bunch of atoms however the point of life is not necessarily to find truth but to find more ways to enjoy life and provide substance for it Look at Maximus Pryme comment for a more focused analysis of Nietzsche than my rambling essay,medium,medium
Feel like i dont wanna go on anymoreI like to do art music and all and those keep me alive But what hurts most is being so down to the point where i couldnt Even do those things anymore I feel trapped and shit I know its mostly mental but i feel like shit I feel unhealthy even slowly developing shitty habits I dont eat like I used to and I havent been genuinely happy in such a long time I wanna quit school for my health but i cant so that adds to my pain I dont have much peoppe to talk to because i say the same shit over again and no matter how many times i try to get better i keep falling apart Im just so sick and tired I have genuine intentions i have been trying my best to become a better person to at least make people smile but in the end depression is too overwhelming I feel like i have nothing I feel like my parents dont understand though i know they want the best for me Its just crazy I feel like im going crazy too Its been a long ride and i really feel like giving up I know it s a cowardly thing to say to some but im human after all Maybe my dreams were too great for my situation Ive had so many traumatizing experiences and nobody i know really relates It just sucks I dont know how to keep going anymore,high,medium
One last shot before i make the final decisionM throwaway for obvious reasons amp x B After spending several months deperately trying to find a plan or another way out of this mess i haven t come up with a single viable solution so i will try to post this somewhere for someone to read maybe even care Story Suicide and depression have always been in my blood my father hanged himself when i was just and my big brother jumped in front of a train when i was It s important for me to say that i have had a good life my youth was not a place of depression or despair at all I had friends girls and i did really well in high school despite almost no attempt I had a quirk however that still destroys me to this day i have this tendency to push people away in a very dramatic way when they get to close That naturally do mean that i speak to noone from my high school days or even before the majority have explicit hate towards me Anyway the story of how i am where i am today During studying for my B Sc https B sc i got a relevant part time job on the side and i absolutely hated every minute of it I made the choice to finish my degree and basicly take extra cources regarding topics that cought my interest and i could ses myself pursueing a career in Since my B Sc https B Sc is in economics and business administration i had the opportunity to influence it to a certain degree Fast forward to when i completed my B Sc https B Sc I was incredibly lucky to get enrolled into exactly the master s degree i had intented on top of that i met the girl of my dreams Everything was lining up perfectly and the plan was made Study like a madman spend time with the girl and apply for relevant part time jobs or internships rince and repeat every day And i did However my grades were going down the drain and despite several interviews i did not get any job months into my Masters my self esteem is non existent and its taking a toll on my relationsship Since my GF would never even think of leaving me at the time she was always a bubbly person and her life was progressing quickly for the better she put things on hold to help me get up again This were something i could not live with i have no intention of holding anyone back or make their life a compromise so i decided to leave her I still remember the last thing i said to her at the time This is the biggest mistake i have ever made in my life Fast forward months things are going even worse i completely realize that soon have a close to worthless degree and cant get a job and i am ashamed to even see my friends who s lifes are lining up perfectly However one day a hear a silent knock on my front door Its my now Ex girlfriend with tears in her eyes she tells me she loves me and i am the only one she ever wants to be with i tell her i love her first time i ever told anyone We get back together The next months are horrible i start seing a psychotherapist without my girl knowing I am diagnosed with depression anxiety and sleep deprivation I get medication for all of it For some reason every second is pure agony to me and i eventually plan my own suicide January By November I decide to leave my now ex girl to lessen the blow of me passing away Going all november and december planning my suicide while doing my exams I somehow decide the give life another chance It s hard to explain but people around you can sense when you doing horrible i got random message from friends telling me i was a good guy and other encouriging words out of the blue despite no one knowing of my condition New years eve i get a long text from my ex girlfriend that she loved me she will never forget me that we might me some where down the line in a better place One week after i decide to go to her place just the way she did for me in hopes of a sweet reunion However things go really dark She is home with another guy She s angry at me she s says she hates me She tells me that she called the cops Right after she deletes and blocks me from any form of contact and social media One month later she s engaged to this succesful rich and handsome guy seemingly as happy as she wll ever be She loved me until she found something better The months after are tough i plan another date for my suicide July I continue to write my masters thesis and try to meet new people I just delivered my master thesis its horrible final nail in the coffin for my GPA I managed to get no part time jobs or internships despite applications during my studies I have applied for close to full time jobs the last months No interviews The girl of my dreams are getting married to a guy who is everything i tried to be but could not By October i will be out on the streets with nothing but debt My friends are doing well and i am ashamed to see them I once heard someone say that suicide is only a viable option when there is no hope for a better future I believe there isn t Even if i get a job to scrape by I will have to live a miserable lonely live because of the decisions i made I dont believe i can I still want to emphasize that i have had a good life However i do not believe there are any more happy moments for me Spoiled i know Sorry for not so well written english and the wall of text I expect nothing but it certaintly does not hurt to write it out,high,high

Not meant for this worldI ve been coming to the conclusion that I was simply not made for this world I am irrationally empathetic especially with those closest to me I have a nature of literally only taking care of others and not myself and I get severely disgusted whenever I do nice things for myself Sometimes I ll go days on end of not eating or drinking simply bent on the thought of my desire to help and care for others My body can t take it anymore Shit hit the fan pretty bad for me when the virus started to break out across the US I was forced to move from the first place I had truly called home college It was my first year there away from an abusive and neglecting family that had abandoned me once before People genuinely cared for me at the college I was at and I felt a sense of well being that I had never before experienced in my life The virus ripped me out of my dorm and sent me back home to an older brother and father that are constantly on edge ready to explode The last and only thing I could put my hope in were my grandparents My grandma is the most loving and caring person I have ever met and she is easily my closest friend My grandpa always provided me the greatest advice and support One week back at home continuing the spring semester online I got news that my grandpa was hospitalized for a severe and complicated medical condition To add on my grandma s knees gave out and she too was hospitalized for a close to death heart attack I immediately went over to be with them in the hospital and I would go on to take care of them back at their home for the rest of the semester It was by far the most stressful time of my life Having to stay on top of schoolwork provide consistent care for my grandparents and manage my own health heart and mental issues was extremely difficult But I was more than willing to do anything for my grandparents because of all that they had done for me After a tragic fall and a brutal season of hospice my grandpa passed At that point I couldn t take it any more I promised myself years ago that the pain I felt after my other grandpa passed I was not going to go through it again I was going to do whatever it took to not have to bear with another loved ones death And so here I am now I was not strong enough to care for my grandpa and I failed him I failed my grandma for not being the kind of support that she needed I don t deserve the right to live because of my faults I ve just been so numb ever since he passed that I completely have no idea what to do,medium,high
I will never feel loved When I was younger I didn t mind not having any relationships and just hanging out with friends was enough now I just am thinking more and more about relationships with the other sex I m pretty awkward and don t really have a lot going for myself these days I mean who wants to get with someone who has no job no car not many friends and basically has no life experience or motivation to do anything I life It is what it is I guess and I m probably just gonna be alone forever and buy a dog and just chill watching the world go by I have always been a loner and probably always will be which sometimes I am fine with because I enjoy my own company and enjoy doing stuff on my own time without having to run it by everyone else I suffer from depression anxiety and panic attacks along with learning disabilities I guess you could say I m more of a liability or a burden to most people which doesn t help the relationship situation because everyone wants a finished project instead of a work in progress and that s cool people have standards and some people know what they want out of life and what they look for in a partner but sometimes the standards are set too high we re your looking for perfect person which obviously doesn t exist because we are all flawed to some extent I usually just drink a lot to help with the pain inside my mind because the buzz of alcohol helps me picture love basically alcohol is the only thing that helps me feel better and think I m loved which I know is probably not healthy but when your at the bottom you got to have some coping mechanisms otherwise you won t be able to go on with life This is basically me a nobody with no life who is left behind everyone he ever knew in life and has no motivation to do anything in life and has a lot of problems I just wonder what love feels like because it seems to mean it doesn t exist,medium,medium

The thought of the end is the only thing that makes me happy I m not entirely sure what to say I often find myself lost for words but now I need them more than ever I have been depressed for a while now and I have tried oh lord have I tried to get rid of it to make it disappear I no longer think I have the capability to be happy it seems almost impossible I m going to apologize in advance for the inevitable essay but this is my first post and I have a lot of things I need aired I need someone to hear me to listen to me before I explode First of all my mother died when I was she was and died suddenly Obviously there was a lot of heart ache sadness and so on the stuff you would normally expect from anyone who loved their mother My father worked away so my sister and I never had a stable home sometimes we lived with my Nan and Grandfather other times we would stay with my Auntie and then occasionally my other Nan would look after us My mother s mother was a wonderful person I finally allowed myself to open up to someone and she took me in with open arms She was the only person who would tell my father when he was wrong She died when I was To this day seeing my Grandfather cry was the most heart wrenching thing I have ever witnessed I then found a wonderful boyfriend he treated me like I was everything but of course my best friend didn t like sharing my time with someone else and then she left my life too I still miss her It was at this time that I had noticed that my eczema had started to get worse and nothing was curing it I took my skin problem to a doctor and was referred to a dermatologist He was baffled and had no idea what it was tried different tests and treatments but to no avail Since then I have been to various doctors around the UK travelling far and wide to seek treatment My condition got even worse my body was is covered Itchy and sore Later that year my uncle died and then so did my Grandfather I started to think it was all my fault and that maybe I was a curse to my family I tried to commit suicide three times and carved the shit out of my thighs I stopped eating properly because I thought I was enormous I weighed kg My boyfriend could no longer handle me I was erratic and self destructive He left after two years of suffering me It was at this point that I had really decided that life wasn t for me I was in pain all day every day because of my skin I had to leave school after my GCSE s because the pain was unbearable and I could hardly motivate myself to leave my bed I then got diagnosed with a new illness called Myasthenia Gravis for those who don t wish to Google the disease it is simply something which makes your muscles incredibly weak to the point where it is hard to walk eat and sometimes even talk I am now on steroids which is helping but the condition isn t curable I am just hoping that it will go into remission someday On top of all this I had to look after my year old sister since my grandparents were no longer around to do so Huff I am starting to feel like I am writing this for the wrong reasons I feel like I m writing a sob story and that wasn t what I wanted I ll quickly explain what happens after that I decided to get myself better mentally tried so unbelievably hard finally felt like I succeeded got my boyfriend back after a year of trying moved out of my house and into my boyfriend s parents house because my father was verbally abusive and kind of got my social life back on track But here I am now Back where I started Rejected all of my friends again Too afraid to leave the house My boyfriend is wonderful but I feel like he can t give me what I need I sit here every day feeling like there is a massive empty space inside of me I m desperately trying to find something to fill it but there is nothing I want nothing from this life anymore If I knew that I could die tomorrow without hurting my boyfriend or my sister I would do it I would end it I have no one to talk to because I am too afraid of losing my boyfriend again and I don t trust anyone else I am poor as shit because I had to leave school because of my illnesses and couldn t get a job for the same reason The government is also unwilling to help at all I am now kg heavier than I was before because of my medicines and I feel like an elephant I am terribly unsatisfied with the way that I look I have seen a glimpse of happiness and it is totally not worth the effort This sounds incredibly gay I have no idea who I am anymore and I am so scared for my future I just want to curl up into a ball and fade away I have tried to leave out my father in all of this because even thinking of him makes me angry however I will tell you this that man can go to hell for what he has put me through I am not living I m just wasting time TL DR Was depressed then happy ish and now I see no point in living,high,high

Girlfriend has tried to commit suicide twice in a monthHi everyone My girlfriend is an absolutely wonderful person with an absolutely horrific past She has gone through things I would not wish on my worst enemy She suffers from severe depression and bipolar Lately she has been feeling very worthless because of her job and not having a degree She was on the right track though she enrolled to go back to school to become a Vet Tech Things seemed like they were getting better But late last month she made her first suicide attempt I rushed her to the ER and she was sent to Inpatient for a few days It seemed to really do her a lot of good They changed her medication and set her up with a counselor Things were going fine for several weeks but yesterday we got back from a really nice vacation and as I was trying to go to bed she was in the other room writing her suicide note and taking about pills I had a bad feeling so I went to check on her and she was really out of it I rushed her to the ER and she will be there for a few days until they can transfer her back to inpatient I just dont know what to do She lives with me because her family is horrible I am her main source of support But I also struggle with anxiety and depression I can barely take care of myself I am also fairly young I have a decent job so I can support us both but it is so tough I want her to get help but I feel that having her at my apartment is not the best for her since I work so much I feel like im tearing myself apart worrying about her all the time And after this last attempt I am going to feel so uneasy leaving her alone anymore I constantly worry I am going to come home one day to find her lifeless,high,high

it s rude to have guests over if you re deadmy brain keeps yelling at me that i could just take my entire bottle of zoloft right now if i really wanted to and i could die and it d all be easier i got diagnosed with bpd earlier this week but i has to be wrong because no one has said anything for the over years i ve been in therapy i m a bad person i already know that and i m not crazy i saw this video of a woman who talked about gt writing letters to people in her own blood lt and like i m crazy i guess but not that crazy i m just thinking about dying and i realize no one would miss me and the people who say they would are probably just lying to me because everyone leaves and why would anyone anywhere ever try to help me or actually care it s just fucking ridiculous imagining that anything good will happen when it never will the only thing keeping me from doing it is that i have a guy coming over to build my pc with me later and i think it d be kinda rude to invite someone over and then when they show up you re dead i mean that s giving them an experience they weren t asking for and would probably fuck them up for life amp x B if anything this is all just a stupid feeling that s gonna pass later and by the time he leaves i ll be fine and i don t wanna come off like an attention whore like i m sure everyone thinks i am but i know no one is gonna respond to this it s just easy to yell into the void i guess,high,high

There s a bridge near my new house On Tuesday morning I woke up feeling exhausted My head was pounding with a headache my nose snuffed up my shoulders hurt my chest was tight my back was aching I cried I cried hard I cried about the rash consuming my legs I cried about how I have little meaningful relationships I cried about how I assume people think of me I cried about my job And my living situation I cried about being different I pulled myself together for a moment and decided to go to a walk in clinic Something I ve been putting off for months I went downstairs and jumped in the shower And I sobbed while washing my hair And screamed and yelled at myself and the world not through anger or hate but because of my inability to change or more so the self sabotage that I routinely commit I dried off avoiding my reflection in the mirror I microwaved some chicken fingers and drank a bottle of water I watched a YouTube video about a board game And then I cried some more I called the local mental health crisis centre where I ve dragged myself to in the past because they ve called me twice in two weeks and I haven t returned either of their calls I scheduled a meeting with a counsellor for two weeks from now knowing damn well I might not make it that far I don t have a doctor but I know what I do have and undiagnosed mental illness Or I m looking for a crutch Something to label myself so I know it s not my fault for putting myself in the positions I do At this point I was dressed and ready to leave my house I put on my sunglasses and headed out but I didn t head toward the busy main street or the clinic I started off toward the bridge A pedestrian bridge towering above jagged rocks and a river with an unforgiving current I walked slowly and confidently down the street toward the park housing the bridge My mind ablaze with the thoughts of ending it The image of myself laying upon the rocks for hours My lungs filling with blood Cold Scared But I turned at the last second Left instead of right And just walked for hours I walked until the road ended and I was exhausted Then I walked back on the busy main street Watching the people going on with their days Only stopping the get a pack of cigarettes which I had quit two months prior and a coffee And then I went home The thoughts are still there but I have them in check again To die another day,high,high

"I have had a funny feeling lately. Kind of unusual. Its like I woke up from a nap kind of late after a long day of work.When I awoke it was already dark, and suddenly my dark apartment felt extremely dark. And the Normal solitude I am accustomed to became so intolerable. It almost felt like a panic attack in a way.Yet my heart was not racing. Yet I felt on edge, and so so very alone.I busied myself with some quick chores. Suddenly a friend of mine messaged and I messaged them back quickly. They even called and its like I was so thrilled to talk with them for awhile and the feeling began to fade.I just do not understand it well.I have lived alone for several years nowand I am accustomed to it even prefer it at times.And yet waking up suddenly this evening the feeling of being alone felt like a prison. Completely intolerable.I was curious if anyone has ever felt anything like that. I know I have been a bit depressed latelyIm wondering if some of my anxiety symptoms are returning perhaps in a different way. Anxiety and depression about solitude?",medium,low

It feels like it s creeping up on me not sure how much longer I can go on with it It s been exactly a month since my mother died at the age of I always considered myself to not have to worry about the scenario until I was in my s but here I am dealing with it at the age of I ve been criticized and pointed out at how well I m coping with all of this happening for me but deep down inside I m hurt like the rest of them I m just desensitized from all the quarrels problems and depression leading up to it not to mention nightmares almost every single night since then It used to be just my mother myself and my brother all living together My father left because of a relationship dispute some time ago when I was younger but he has still been there for me But since this has all happened it has felt like nothing but control over the situation He doesn t want to support me and my brother financially while he s the only one with a job right now and he can t support us socially because he lives in another city The most he s done is tell us to get a job and start manning up to the responsibilities that my mother used to take care of but to be fair neither me or my brother have had the willpower to do anything since I want to go and see a grievance counselor with my brother but procrastination depression and anxiety has been getting the better of both of us and I doubt my father would be willing to help in that regard I feel really broken right now Unable to work and keep up in today s society Everyone s pushing us forward telling us what to do how to do what we need I feel it s only a matter of time before either me or my brother hatches an idea and it plays out like some sort of dramatic movie I asked my brother today how is he feeling today on a scale from being like any other day to being that he knows today is his last He replied I replied although that s probably just the desensitization talking and I m probably more closer to or I feel like this is all revolving around money It doesn t feel right at all especially considering that my mother used to get paid spousal support and she d spend that money on me and my brother It now goes all back to my dad and haven t seen anything since I ve tried speaking up against my dad about this but the most he does is hold what little he supports us on right now over our heads and asks if we want his support or not I don t know what to do anymore I don t know how to live I definitely don t know how to help myself A lot of these things I would have asked my mother to hold my hand and help me do them She would give me so much support through it until I was able to do it myself but now all I get is tough love,high,high
Long Story Need supportI ve been depressed suicidal for a long time but it s gotten worse over the past year It started last year I chose my best friend to be the one to take my virginity because I trusted him He felt honored that I had chosen him and it was a big deal Unfortunately I got a really bad ovarian cyst so we couldn t do it right away We promised to wait until I was completely better He broke that promise when he started dating his cheating girlfriend a few months after She has another boyfriend and she s cheating on him with my best friend and she has made excuses for not wanting to break up with her original boyfriend for my best friend The fact that he broke our promise really hurt me A few months after he started dating her I was sexually harassed on my way home from school I was on a public train during the winter and this guy started harassing me Another man defended me However the offender proceeded to threaten the guy by saying he was going to shoot him He didn t pull out a gun but the threat was there I got out of the train as soon as the doors opened After that I wanted to see my best friend for support I told him what happened and had asked him if we could meet up over the weekend the incident took place on a Monday But he decided that spending the weekend at his cheating girlfriend s place was more important than helping me I couldn t keep my feelings about everything anymore and I decided to talk to my best friend about it We got into a fight over it It turns out that he had forgotten about the promise we had made and that has permanently changed the way I saw the world People always say to think about your loved ones and how they would feel if you committed suicide but after what he did I couldn t help but think that if it was so easy to forget a promise that big how easy is it to forget someone s existence If I committed suicide no one would miss me They d simply forget about me my abusive family my friends everyone so it wouldn t matter He also tried justifying him choosing to stay at his cheating girlfriend s place over supporting me but the thing is it s not like she was in trouble or in need of support or anything He also didn t have work I needed him and in a moment of need he picked his girlfriend over me which is something he promised to never do but I guess he broke that promise out of desperation considering how many failed relationships he s had He said if I had considered if the guy who harassed me was bluffing about the gun Of course I had considered it and so did the police however threats of using a weapon are taken extremely seriously Plus I didn t know if he was bluffing or not He could have been but he could also have been serious I told him that work is understandable for not being able to see me during that time but going to his girlfriend s house instead of helping me during an important time is not and that he can go to her house at any time He said Still it s what I chose to do cause I wanted to We fought some more I did hurl a few insults here and there and he said he s not going to talk to me for insulting him for spending time with his girlfriend We eventually apologized and made up The thing is the damage has been done and I m still hurt by everything I haven t completely forgiven him either I can t look at the world the same This combined with living in an abusive household and being made of my family and family friends about me eating I m skinny has taken a toll I think about suicide almost all the time and I have no one to talk to I ve tried antidepressants but the ones I ve tried so far haven t worked for me so I m still looking for the right one I see a psychiatrist and a counselor at school but it s summer break and I can t see anyone now especially because I live with a narcissistic mom I ve attempted suicide a few times during the summer including on my birthday I can t stop thinking about suicide I don t know what to do I ve contacted hotlines a few times but I don t want to be a nuisance and they re not always helpful Nothing seems to be working anymore I want to die I wish I was never born I hate the world I don t want to be here anymore,high,high

I don t know what to do anymoreI m a junior trying to take two AP classes and a concurrent enrollment class all at the same time while being apart of activities and working hours a week I just can t do it anymore I can t quit my job because I need the money feel too guilty to accept money from my mom my parents are divorced and my dad doesn t really help out with money stuff and my parents won t let me quit unless it gets to be too much In my mom s eyes this is just a normal part of adolescence and I m handling it fine I also can t really decrease my hours because I m already working just about the bare minimum I was in an honors type program for the majority of my education up until I entered high school at which point I began taking AP and college level courses This year I m taking a total of AP classes and concurrent enrollment classes as well as electives I can t handle all of the pressure and I don t have enough time to get the things done that I need to I m clinically depressed but don t take antidepressants Due to my course load it s gotten to the point where I don t even have time to sleep or eat meals which is taking a toll on my mental health I don t have time for friends or hobbies I miraculously made it this far in high school with a GPA but I also put too much pressure on myself to preform well in school This means that its really hard for me to give myself any kind of break because I just can t justify it I don t know what to do anymore In August my suicidal thoughts got really bad so I went to my doctor and started seeing a therapist For a while school started to take up so much of my time that I didn t really have time to be depressed but now I just can t deal with all of this It s just too much and I don t know who to go to anymore or how to alleviate any of this In recent weeks my suicidal thoughts have been sporadically returning I don t know what to do and I m scared,high,high

Am I crazy or just sleep deprived So I ve been told that I have a very keen sense of smell as I can smell something cooking from across the house when no one else can smell it but sometimes I smell things that don t make a ton of sense like smelling root beer when I m alone in my room with no soda in the middle of the night and I just heard what sounded like faint whispering like the kind shows will play when they re trying to create a creepy ambiance but idk it could have been a combination of people moving around and a dripping faucet mixed with my paranoia I didn t get a lot of sleep last night and I don t tend to get a lot of sleep in general could it just be sleep deprivation I saw a therapist a while back and the whole out of body coping mechanism thing came up because I d been having a lot of that and he asked me if I d been smelling things that didn t make sense because that can mean olfactory hallucinations which can relate to psychiatric problems that tie into the out of body thing but I said no at the time because while I figured I probably had I couldn t think of any specific instances But that whole conversation kinda made me paranoid Am I fine I mean probably,low,medium

I don t know even know what I wan t anymore I am soon and I have never kept in touch with people I ve met I don t have any friends I m the oldest of my two siblings I never feel like I fit anywhere I work I get along with everyone because I m scared I might indirectly hurt them and I m more reserved than most people but I always felt like the odd one out like I should not be here the people I even talk regularly if you can even call it something like that which is only at party s never anytime else I was always picked on from my younger school years to high school and college but I didn t let that bother me as long as my siblings were doing fine I can only hold a conversation for more than a few minutes with either family or from my younger siblings who introduce me I still never talk to anyone I can t find the words to strike up a conversation with anyone I even feel safer and more relaxed if I can not talk to as little amount of people as possible I am constantly getting a nudge from life to go out and do things Now I ve grown up a bit more since I was younger I just want to be an ordinary guy but i don t know what that even means I think as I feel I ve done all I wan t to do I don t feel like celebrating or attending birthdays weddings anything like that I sit in my room with my door locked and just sleep I get so sad and feel like such a stupid asshole that people are dying everyday and I m just feeling like I wanna just die I ve been close to doing it but I can never push my self all the way I m not sure if I m allowed to list them here I hate my self so much it hurts but I know that if I do I would leave my younger brother and sister without a brother and that tears at my heart that I could feel so selfish but I feel like I ve done everything I ve wanted to do I feel like there s nothing there left to keep my life flowing down the river of time and it s now just a pointless struggle to exist everyday It might sound weird but feel so sad when I eat or drink anything or when I even walk or lay down I feel like I ve killed something that my eyes cannot even see like I m taking something away from the universe by even being alive I ve seen others posts and feel like I can finally unbottle these feelings I ve had for awhile I could never express I always have had to have bottled up feeling like I could explode and collapse in tears I ve always tried to keep to myself afraid to hurt someone s feelings by saying the wrong thing or inadvertently being the thing something that would lead to someone being hurt I m honestly not sure how long I can keep on day after day just drifting before I try ending myself again I m not looking for friends or pity just needed to write this to see if it helps,high,high

Suicidal Mental issues MDD SA military alcoholic etcI m using this as a way to unload so excuse the walls of text Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this I appreciate it I am early s male in the allegedly smart branch of our oh so glamorous military I have a house to myself I m stationed in Europe I have money almost k in the market a car paid off in April a motorcycle a cat who is a huge dick and pees on all my fucking cloths Pretty sure she is really a daemon of some sort and being a government employee I don t do a fuckin thing and it s pretty hard for me to be fired No I have never seen combat I m a cyberspace operator fucking stupid which is what the AF calls sysadmin for servers fucking year old laptops running winserv what a joke I digress I imagine a significant amount of people would kill to have what I have And here I am on a Saturday night drinking bourbon and wondering when the time comes to blow my brains out if I should do it outside so there s less of a mess I ve been in almost years now and I m on my second assignment A dream assignment My first base was in flyovercountry USA Good people and great place to raise kids but shitty and boring for young people But at least there I had people I could turn to people who would fight for us people who knew more than me I thought coming to Europe would be a major upgrade I couldn t have been more wrong My office is filled mostly with FNGs Our only NCO is a fuckwit I like Sgt Fuckwit as a person but he she is a terrible manager Does what he she is told even if it s unreasonable and would NEVER fight for their troops Doesn t know a MOTHER FUCKING THING about computers And this person is in charge What s that saying about never being the smartest person in the room Yeah I m the only mother fucker who can set up our equipment But most days we all just surf reddit and imgur I do about minutes of acutal work a week And by work I mean pointless military bullshit like SAPR training and how I need to not rape people Anyway I ve been in therapy for over half a year now for major depressive disorder social anxiety and being a threat to myself Also have OCD Schizoid traits I was hospitalized last year for a week because I was seriously ready to kill myself My doctors are pretty cool I have a good rapport with my shrink But since I couldn t be fixed to an acceptable level within the time allotted I am being medically discharged Short of serving and getting retired it s the best way to leave I ll get something like of my base pay for as long as I m fucked in the head Still want to kill myself I picture myself living in a shitty apartment no job bored miserable drunk etc I was also diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder I was told not to drink for months at which point I could return to responsible alcohol use afterwards I complied mostly to prove them wrong but also to see how I would feel sober As you can imagine it was terrible not being able to drink especially when everybody else is The cocksuckers lied to me though told me that I was still too much at risk after the and that mixing antidepressants and alchol is a no no Like I give a shit I tried their ways I stayed sober did the CBT kept a fucking diary and so on The best advice they offer is find a purpose and distract yourself Still fucked up Still want to die Oh and because I VOLUNTARILY seeked treatment I was referd read forced for alcohol abuse treatment Because I was was in that I am automatically getting marked down on my annual performance report In the grand scope of things it doesn t mean shit but GOD DAMN what a fucking kick int he balls I save the fucking day countless times setting up that fucking eqiuptment but nobody gives a shit I m mintues late to work and all hell breaks loose I get written the fuck up some shit that says damaged the unit s mission capapblities http i imgur com lMNMAf jpg mintues late to surfing the internet at my desk Whole fucking squadron stops land the fucking jets can t do jack shit till fucktheusaf is sitting at his desk looking at cat pictures Moving on It probably comes as absolutely no suprise that I m single I was talking to this girl last week Met her she seemed nervous I thought things were going well It was like she changed her mind in the course of a mintue or something Tried texting her but she s done I always feel so fucking stupid afterwards ya know Like embarressed with myself for even entertaining the thougth that this time will be different Then tonight I find out that my friend who barely tries and doesn t even give a shit either way got fucked some girl last night I know I can t compare myself to him apples and organges But holy fuck did that shit sting A kind of envy that pierces my fucking soul like a red hot fireplace poker And ya know it s not so much that I m alone It s that I can t overcome the human nature of needing someone It isn t even about sex it s about that Caritas the non judemental love the feeling of mattering to someone Shit maybe I wasn t held enough as a baby or something I just think to myself okay fine I don t get to have anyone That s shitty but fine I ll accept that Can I at least be content alone No I need to feel lonely and miserable huh No matter what I read and where I search I won t find any answers and I can t make the pain any less huh That s fucked up When I do kill myself I ll do my best to explain it wasn t being an unwanted social retard that killed me it was not being able to just fucking let it go I m unwanted Fine Life goes on right No I feel this pain until the very end I killed myself because I couldn t fucking get over it So fucking weak And now it s time for me to freshen my drink Thank you for taking the time to read my bullshit,high,high
I m just tiredI could go on and on about how shitty my life is In reality it s not It really bothers me how I complain how my dad died And how I ve lost a lot of important people in my life Death fucked me up But it angers me to know that even though I ve been through a lot I still have an easy life Just because my sister is transgender and autistic and has so many behavior issues it doesn t ruin my life Sure it makes it hard And how my dad was a dumbass and fell off the god damn roof trying to repair a leak when I was But when I go somewhere to buy something swipe my card and don t even feel the need to check my bank account I always think of the children who have nothing How my car though used would be a monument to those somewhere else I am truly grateful for everything in my life How I ve lost so many friends and loved ones but I still have the privilege to get help And have a therapist and a psychiatrist I feel as if my depression shouldn t exist I have been given every single opportunity in life for greatness Yet I am still tired The final nail in the coffin was this exact day last year when I received the news of my childhood best friend and neighbor passing away in a car accident It broke me Not even I wasn t even a shell of a person My soul was nonexistent Everything I stood for and believed in is meaningless We all work so hard to fight just to die Immediately my ed came back and i was put on antidepressants I had to see my therapist and psychiatrist often My mom turned into a narcissistic asshole who had the audacity to tell everyone on the street her husband died for some pity She used people who attention She made others pity us and what hard lives we ve had as I sit in my half a million dollar home with AC and running water I don t know I feel like everyone who s died in my life and my ed my self harm how i was bullied out of my school it feels meaningless I have a god damn iphone I have no reason to be depressed I don t even feel anything I truly am just tired of living And not even that I crave death I just hate existence To inevitably die and be worthless ash and just a mere memory to those who cared about me How those people too will die and my existence will be nothing in the spacetime continuum How everyday I get up to grieve to work to study to have a perfect life just to die and becoming filth I just feel unmotivated to live How I hate my body so much that I am too afraid to have sex with my boyfriend How I feel like I look like a man How I am so undesirable and so so mean Oh I m not a good person and I know that It s as if my existence doesn t benefit the world I don t feel like a burden or that I need to die I just want to I hate this feeling of working towards nothingness And how I miss my loved ones so much I want nothing more than to just lay in bed and close my eyes forever,medium,high

Could anyone give me advice I ve had psychological problems for as long as I can remember and I ve reached out for help so many times but no matter what I do nothing changes The first few times I asked for help I told my parent I was depressed This was when I was barely a teenager and she just did the normal parent thing of saying What do you have to be depressed about Then a few years later I started self harming and not attending school My school made me see a psychologist for low attendance but they said I was fine My Mother told them about my self harming which I m sure they already knew about if and this psychologist said it s just trendy and that her son does it because he s a Goth Those words makes me cringe to this day My Mother took me to my GP anyway and they refused me to refer me to any mental health service and gave me a leaflet for a mental health service of which I was not within the age range I later dropped out of school I started drinking to deal with it then having strange symptoms derealisation depersonalisation I was having panic attacks multiple times everyday and completely socially isolates myself for a few years I felt terrible all the time and was deeply disturbed by my thoughts When things got a little better I decided to go back to school as I had no qualifications and went on to study a course which could get me into University studying a science related degree I found the work stupidly easy and went through with good grades By the time I was on my last year my mental health was deteriorating quickly I could no longer concentrate or function at school or in any other area of my life I went to my GP and they asked me some irrelevant questions about my Father none about my symptoms apart from weight loss gain and sleep Then refused to give me SSRI s I went home and some time later my memory is a blur I tried to kill myself I ve now had two serious attempts at taking my life and I m positive there s no way for me to get help but if I don t get help soon I know I m going to try again And I know it will likely work this time I ve tried to get help so many times I can t even leave my house anymore I don t know what to do Nobody is taking me seriously and I have no idea what s wrong with me How can I get help I ve even tried reaching out to people working in the NHS Nothing comes of it I have people who depend on me and I don t want to put my potential to waste but I m running out of time and I ve tried everything I can I don t even have the emotional energy anymore I m not scared of dying and the idea is quite appealing to me regardless of my mental state so if it happens it happens I have multiple mental health problems as well as sensory processing problems relating to a neurodevelopment disorder I have and just existing is torture to me Even when my mental health is okay I want the suffering to end I m so so tired I just need to know that I tried for the people I care about and my own philosophical reasons And I would do anything in my power to turn this situation around If anyone can offer any advice to me then please leave a comment Anything you have to say will be helpful to me,high,high

I was born a burdenI ve always felt like a burden Whether it be the medical bills to the food to the clothing I ve just always been a detriment to my family I don t live lavishly I let my sister and mother and father live the life they can Part of that life includes reminding me how much money I ve l c ost my parents My mother has always been this way and up until recently I had just had to deal with it I grew depressed and eventually turned to drugs and alcohol However I always kept a fine GPA and stayed in tune with what I was good with and kept working on my various side projects That became too much for me and I looked into moving in with my father for the time being due to the fact that my mother had become unbearable My father a much more timid spirit could continue to talk to me in a serious conversation instead of devolving from worried to screaming like my mother I ve gone to many different therapists to help with family problems depression and some mental troubles I was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier last year and instead of helping me my parents decided it was in their better interests to ignore it and because of this I currently have to wake up in the morning and suffer every second while I m awake until I sleep which turns into a hour turn and toss fest until I wake up and don t have the will to try sleeping again To get to work and school my father helped me buy a car No longer can I tell if he continually reminds me of the car s price and how much he could ve done for himself with the money I want to pay him back as soon as possible but I am in no position to even start dealing with that matter My mother can t be trusted She goes out of her way to make my life harder She will call and text me every hours asking if I m available for dinner or some sort of meeting where when I decide to meet her she will spend as long as she can doing her best to remind me that she gave birth to me and it was the worst mistake in her entire life I no barely eat at this point because I m afraid to walk into the kitchen and make food out of ingredients I didn t purchase and I m barely making enough money to pay for school and gas as it is I cry on average or times a day but I think it s just a bad habit because I haven t gained anything from it yet I still consider suicide every day but it s not feasible when considering the position I am in It s selfish I read that suicide has a greater chance of hurting me long term over killing me If I attempt suicide I d probably mess it up and end up becoming a figure that sits in bed all day and drains my parents money on medical bills If I do somehow succeed with suicide my parents will end up having to pay my funeral expenses At this point in life I m slowly building up the money so I can safely move away and cut all contact with my family Maybe I won t be happy but they can be I m lost,high,high

took half a bar of xan i was hella loopy and shit and got really depressed the night before i made a pretty bad cut and i wanted to go deeper i stumbled for my box cutter and cut i reached fat i was bleeding a lot but i wasn t panicking i put gauze and wrapped it up rly tight i called my friend for around minutes and all i remember was saying i m gonna die over and over again i vividly remember his disappointed yet calm voice saying you re not going to die idk how but i hung up i don t remember much after but i know i took the other half and blacked out with no other memory of what happened i have videos of me on snap talking to myself saying shit like i don t have any real friends when i woke up my head was killing me and my cut was still bleeding w yellow shit coming out of it too i was really worried of infection the night before my dad saw my cut and just put triple anti biotic and medical tape on it so that s what i did for days i told some online friends and they were really worried especially my boyfriend they all were telling me to go to my parents and get stitches but i didn t have enough strength to the first day the days passed and i was getting worried yellow shit was still coming out of it and i got paranoid it was infected so i told my older sister who s she was really worried when she saw it and she made jokes about it that kind of made me feel better but hurt sometimes she decided the best thing was to get my parents i was panicking and didn t want to do i got her to get them downstairs they asked if i did it to myself i said yes they began yelling at me fueled with anger my dad was squeezing my arm and touching my cuts that hurt like hell my mom was the most angry i held back tears but their yelling is what made me cry she was cursing at me making me feel like shit for waking them up it s all a blur really but i remember saying i just feel like a burden my mom laughed and said i was being dramatic and kept saying omg that s how i felt though like a weight being dragged around constantly needing help that i don t ask for my mom made me sleep in her room my dad on the couch like always i begged to just sleep on the couch or in my sisters room but she just said no which i understand i couldn t sleep that night her room even in our old house makes me uneasy i m wide awake my insomnia didn t help either my dad took my phone i was grounded from seeing my friends my room etc i just wanted a hug support from them but what did i expect my parents have always been abusive idk why i didn t guess they d make me feel even shittier to make matters worse both my psychiatrist and therapist just moved so no more of that my pills have been needing refills for weeks but it never happened they never took my depression seriously i ve been diagnosed with depression anxiety ocd add an insomnia i withdrawal from my meds and drugs like weed and xan the next morning i woke up early like early i spent the day watching the office i just wanted to laugh my mom of course got angry but didn t do much about it i changed my bandaids on my own my parents didn t bother with it too much even though it was at an extreme risk of infection i asked friends and strangers if it looked infected and read how to keep it clean there was still puss coming out which wasn t normal i asked my mom but she blew it off i didn t know what to do but keep cleaning it i slept in my sisters room that night the next day my day had bought spray on liquid bandage that i ve never heard of i found out later it should be used for minor cuts he sprayed it inside of the cut i have a high pain tolerance but i almost cried he kept pinching my cuts i told him i could do it but he kept denying it i put on more medical tape and it hurt all day i regret telling them so much my friend recommended calling suicide hotline to get cps involved but i couldn t do that to my younger sister so i never did ive been feeling pretty empty even right now my cuts have healed pretty well but my mind has blocked out a lot of the memory of what happened my friend the one i called the night of told me yesterday you know you said something the night u made that cut that really stuck with me you said you weren t even scared or anxious you just did it cause it felt so good is that true i was shocked at that i didn t know what to say i knew it was true but i didn t want it to be i told my boyfriend and he was really scared he told me imagine how scary it is for me trying to have a life w you and not knowing if i can cos idk if youll be alive i felt awful the first deep cut i did i told him he was focused on how he felt and how much i hurt him it sucked but we ve gotten through it don t get me wrong he s absolutely amazing and everything i could ask for i know how hard it is to handle something like this i m paranoid a lot he s going to find someone better or he s lying that he loves me he s always reassuring me though i feel bad for having so many problems he has to deal with i ve been feeling the urge to cut and do xan more and more i haven t though i m trying to get through it i feel hopeless and constantly tired all the time i wish to be dead at times wishing i could disappear the times i ve tried killing myself and fail i feel like i can t do anything right i cant wait to move out of my house i want this all to be over i m so scared constantly i feel like no one cares and no ones going to read this if you did thank you for sticking to the end it means a lot,high,high

Just need some mental help here Not sure how to go on So i ve dealt with depression for a very long time Nothing too severe the majority of the time but sometimes it just spikes and I get happy at the thought of not having to deal with Life You know I got laid off at the beginning of december after having a shitty paycheck for taking a week off due to being sick and as you can imagine I ve run out of money I ve had in my bank account for around a week and a half now after having to pay for a traffic ticket that wasn t really my fault That s what they all say and I m living off of one box of brown rice I found in the back of my pantry I thought I had found a job that could get me through until I found a real one and I was elated but it turned out to basically be a scam I ve made a grand total of for hours of work and I wont even be getting that for another week So you can imagine going from elated to absolutely crushed has ruined me both mentally and physically I don t think I left my room today other than going to the bathroom It s and I haven t even had a drink today And to top all of this off Apparently Hulu can overdraft my bank account even though I told chase when explicitly asked to NEVER let my account be overdrawn So now my bank balance is And I ll be charged a fee for that which I wont be able to pay because I ve only made dollars So there s another fee on top because of that that I won t be able to pay And on and on and on Added to this the fact that if I want a real job at any point in the near future I need to go through college getting myself further into debt even though I don t even know what I want to do for a career anymore I just don t see the actual point of being alive when all I am is unhappy or happy but waiting for a problem to present itself What do Help,high,high

M Finally deciding to get my writing out there I made a website and am unbelievably proud of myself right now I ve been writing all sorts of things for the past year or so and kind of just letting it let me heal and think deeper about certain things It s done so much good for me mentally to get things out I cannot even describe it I lost my grandpa who lived with me in December and writing I was working on a pretty long piece already about something indescribable Life maybe and I ended up incorporating my grief and emotions and processing his loss through the piece writing helped a lot Especially writing about memories that I can go back and read and remember him like he s still here That piece isn t posted anywhere yet I m still going over it and adding and editing and processing One day probably soon I ll release it But that s just kind of a background to what this post is about I made a writing website where I ve posted most of my other pieces and am always adding more and eventually adding the one I mentioned above I used to be really into coding and put it down entirely a few months ago I was making video games not websites so the fact that I made an entire website from the ground up makes me really really proud It s nothing special but I like it And if any of you guys like reading or art you d maybe like what s on it I ve described most of my writings as essays about ambiguous topics that would be inappropriate to write in the standard five paragraph essay format and are way more properly represented through fiction storytelling That s just some Others I describe more like paintings I cannot paint or draw for the life of me so I use writing to paint I hope that makes sense Don t worry if it doesn t Anyway I ve rambled too much I d love talking to literally anyone feel free to message me or comment or anything you want I appreciate it Thanks for reading my post lt here s the site https www bjwiestwriting com https www bjwiestwriting com this is the first place I ve posted it so I m a bit nervous,low,low

Have you ever had a relationship with a suicidal partner and been able to have a good relationship with him her when things got better Hey guys Throwaway account fyi My girlfriend and I ve been together for the last years She s always been depressed since I met her I tried everything to help her but a couple of months ago she tried to commit suicide Luckily I understood something was wrong and could seek medical attention so she could survive Since then I m still doing everything to keep her alive and get better Sometimes it s good some times it s back on the suicide trail She is seeing a psychiatrist and is also medicated I ve read a lot of people writing on different subs about an SO who was suicidal And every story I ve read has ended in ways Suicide and Breakup Now I love my GF and I m living on the hope that she will get better and we ll have the life we deserve with each other But recently I ve started to think if it s actually possible together after everything I ve never read or heard someone stay together after everything Sorry if I ve miswritten anything English is not my mothertounge Tl Dr has anyone lasted with a suicidal partner until things got better,high,high

Considering it Hi all this is my first post I ve been having suicidal thoughts for some time now something that started like years ago I m about to turn and was diagnosed with GAD generalized anxiety disorder Lot s of things have happened in the last eight months as i graduated from med school i finished a five year relationship and tried to start another and my father had a stroke that left him with sequels i currently live with both of my parents This isn t easy for me to write as i feel not only as am a failure but that i m ashamed of myself I don t think i m worthy of anything of value and all effort is futile As my long term relationship was getting worse i got to meet a girl and started to hang out with her around the same time my father had the stroke Never did i cheat before as i was very loyal and had ethic above everything but something really happened and i did I felt awful after but couldn t stop seeing her Few months passed and we got to a point to decide what we should do I called it off as did nt wanted to hurt anybody two months later after finishing the long term relationship i called her and we met only to go out and have this weird date Long story short she s seeing somebody and mentioned that might be the biggest mistake of her life but i have to chose him and the relationship between us can t be for now After not seeing each other since then anymore we re contacting by mail at the moment i miss her ok so there s that My father is not getting better and also has depression so even though i m trying to help him recover nothing seems to work Most probably he won t never be the same I do have friends but i feel like they don t get me Im exercising almost everyday I also go to a psych and im on pregabalin for gad I play guitar and i m trying to record what i can I feel like im doing my best and it s not enough Honestly i don t know where to go o what to do I feel that i only have myself and that it is not enough I m thinking on stuff to do like a bucket list before i go i don t know anymore,high,high

I went out for my final walk the other nightFirst of all apologies for the extremely lengthy post I m years old not that it should matter mental health is an issue at any age I have no friends to confide in and my family is broken and the ones that listen don t offer great advice years ago I tried to take my own life by jumping off a bridge I fell about ft hit water and was instantly knocked unconscious I woke up in hospital the next morning surrounded by doctors and my girlfriend from the time I ve had a rough past all kinds of abuse sexual physical mental alcohol and drugs The tipping point for that episode years ago was when I fell in love with said girlfriend at the time Who actually wasn t quite my girlfriend yet and caught her with her ex We were a thing at the time but hadn t made anything official Small things like that have been known to have a massive effect on me Well r SuicideWatch I would like to say I m an enlightened man But unfortunately I left that woman months ago Things weren t working and we weren t happy anymore But rather than try to fix it I ran away Over the past few weeks I ve began to miss Christine name changed for anonymity really very badly I found out that she has a new boyfriend with whom she is happy on the th of November I went out for my final walk Unfortunately though I had planned to jump from a bridge I neglected to think about which one and as it turns out there are or within a square mile radius of my home None of them are high enough And so I m sat again words revolving around my head over and over Except now I m thinking of various other methods The point of my post wasn t so that people would read it I know people will And I know most people will probably try to console me,high,high

Had a life and everything that entails lost it due to medical mistakes and after years of suffering and being alone I just want out But as you all know that is easier said than done I had a great career was super healthy and fit had a beautiful and smart fiancee who showed me she loved me every day then when more and more medical crap went wrong at the hands of shitty doctors I lost my job and insurance and then all my savings my fitness ability to do anything I enjoyed and the last thing I had this woman who loved me more than anything left me I haven t felt good for about years I am Haven t worked for and haven t had sex for I am the guy people make fun of when they say old guy who lives with his family I don t live in the basement but that s only because it s too full of crap I hate being here and have no privacy and they hate me being here I have been fighting for SSDI for a couple of years now and at this point even maybe winning it won t change that much for me in the big picture and since I have had such shitty lying doctors I have doubts about my ability to win because my records all cover their asses not my ass My conditions won t get better and maybe worse so there isn t any hope if a recovery just mitigating the pain and effects I have nothing to offer a woman and I have a lot of pain that would make sex difficult and probably weird for her so I don t see the year dry spell ending anytime soon I have thought about checking out off and on through the years but just kept going for some pointless reason Fear mostly of screwing up or hurting the handful of people who care a little though they would be hurt far out of proportion to how much I actually mean to them now because they are all drama lovers I have tried therapy and meds but they don t solve the underlying problems so it s just more side effects and hassle with no real results Just fucking tired I cannot see any practical reason to keep going I am sort of past the point of being willing to keep suffering every second of my life so other people don t have to feel bad I decided it wasn t noble to suffer when they don t really care that much it s stupid and selfish of them to expect me to suffer so they don t have to think about it I am really REALLY fucking angry because I had a great life It was stolen from me by greedy fucked up doctors who lied in their records the And their insurance companies who have lobbied to put award caps in place make it really hard for people to win legit malpractice cases anymore since law firms won t help on contingency unless they will get big profits So greed ruined my life in effect and kept me from getting compensated Angry hurting lonely tired,high,high

I am tired I am tired of trying TLDR I hate myself Trauma Depression Bipolar Anxiety I want to kill myself but I can t bring myself to do it I ll start off by saying that I most likely delete this post sometime after posting it I guess I just need to get some stuff out I am years old I m working full time in a career that I worked very hard for A job which brings me much financial security and in some ways brings me some semblance of fulfillment I have an amazing boyfriend who loves me and wants to marry me I have a few good friends I have access to mental health care and support But I still want to die As a kid I grew up in a family of alcoholics and drug users My dad died when I was years old and I grew up with many of my most fond memories of him being drunk and trying to break into the house he broke into the house twice actually My uncle then died of drug and alcohol use On top of that my mom was also an alcoholic and I suffered through years of psychological mental and verbal abuse I frequently have recall memories of my mom yelling at me about how fucked up I was Or how I was fat and ugly Or how I was a bitch Or how I was a slut I was gaslit I was made to believe for a long time that my life with my mom was perfect and I was the one making things difficult by being a drama queen My mom rarely let me leave the house aside from school or going to the grocery store Her being a protective parent did not allow people to pick me up friends or parents so I spent much of my time alone on the weekends and during summer For a long time my mom was one of the few people I hung out with and really she was my best and only friend for years she was my entire life I had no one else It was use against the world During my teenage years I began to show signs of anxiety depression and bipolar looking back on it I can see where I showed signs of bipolar disorder but I was never diagnosed I began self harming and thought of killing myself I would take copious amounts of sleeping pills to sleep and be in a fog during my school days A few times I took more than pills in an attempt to kill myself obviously it did not work High school was some of the worst years of my life I did not think I would make it to the age of years old Now I m I hate my job the job I was supposed to love so much My job brings so much stress and anxiety I no longer see why I went into the field My administration make me want to scream They make my life worse My job makes my life worse I wake up every morning dreading that I have to work My boyfriend is great but I know he deserves so much better Who wants to be with someone as fucked as me Who has baggage like I do My past affects me so deeply and affects my behavior which affects him I have few friends I feel like I am living for my boyfriend but like I said he deserves so much more I want to be everything for him but I do not know if I ever will be I feel guilty because I do have a good life but I still want to die I want to die I want to stop hearing my mom s voice in my head I want to stop being a burden to everyone I want to cease to exist and I want everyone who loves me to move on and find other better people to fill my space in their lives someone more deserving of that space I m struggling with the fact that I made it to my th year it feels so weird to have made it when I thought I would be dead by It s jarring to say the least I don t know how I am supposed to make it any further The future seems so dark and bleak Honestly I don t even see a future for myself I don t deserve to live I am a burden on this earth I just need the courage to do it I apologize to anyone if this post seems rambling I just needed to get this out,high,high

"anxiety and travel anxiety i am new to the anxiety world and unfortunately it has come on so strong and intense this year my fiancÃ©s family travels and i had my first trip with them this february to breckenridge i ended up with acute altitude sickness hospitalized lost close to 12 pounds in five days and spent weeks recovering now i am anxious every time i go anywhere further than an hour from my home we leave for scotland in three weeks and for reference i am with them this weekend two hours from home with the most severe anxiety and depression symptoms iâ€™ve ever experienced to the point where iâ€™d like to go to a hospital just so someone can sedate me 
 also my fiancÃ©s family is wonderful they in no part make me feel any anxiety or stress and are incredibly understanding 
 i am hopefully seeing a therapist this week as well as my primary care doctor to see what to do i suffer from high blood pressure as well which introduces another scary factor into the anxiety cocktail iâ€™m facing i take atenolol beta blocker and amlodopine daily which is actually supposed to help the anxiety however i think iâ€™ve just soared into the next level recently 
 any tips and tricks are appreciated i have an oura ring to track my stress but sometimes feel like i get so wrapped up in the data i stress myself out more 
 
 apologies for the novel typing this out actually felt very therapeutic and calmed me down

I want to kill myself next month on my birthday Turning I have some sort of mental illness I don t know what I have a few theories but I d hate to self diagnose It use to be manageable I had a very loving girlfriend who use to help me and make me feel better I was always open about myself to her but I wasn t very open about my darkside until towards the end of our relationship She realized how bad it was Likewise she also suffered from mental illness and along with that she survived through various forms of abuse throughout her life She broke up with me because I made an egregious mistake which though wasn t built on bad intentions was horrid in its affect I hurt her and I can only hope that she gets better I love her so so much We re trying to be friends but it s obvious that it hurts her healing process to talk to me She was the only person who I felt ever actually cared for me She was the one person who I ever felt emotionally secure with She was the one person who I felt actively cared for me and my well being in that she would worry about me and check up on me Now I don t have her and now I have nothing Its my fault I just want to hug her I hate the way time works When something happens it happens and theres no way you can change it My relationship with my parents is strange My dad is an alcoholic and probably bipolar Sometimes he and I get along but when I m being myself he often calls me weird strange retarded pretentious etc He does it jokingly often times ganging up with my sister on me but it still hurts I go along with it and laugh it off but it hurts He s suicidal The only time I ve seen him in two months was for Thanksgiving I m worried he is going to kill myself out of loneliness as he has no one as well and that it would be my fault for not having seen him recently My mom is very nice and cool but for some reason I just hate it when she talks to me I know one reason is because when I do rarely get emotional she talks to other people about it or makes a bigger deal out of it than the situation warrants or tries to pity me which I also hate I don t like it when she knows things about me because she tries to solve it and because again she tells people about it or will use the information to embarrass me at family events which are already tough for me My sister hates me I think Really I think I m a burden on everyone s life in my family but I m trying to avoid platitudes I think she hates me because she always gets pissed when I talk She ll whisper with my mom when I m out of the room about how inconsiderate and lazy I am Recently I came out of my room to the living room to try to socialize with my mom and sister and when I was responding admittedly annoyed by whatever the fuck she was just huffing and puffing and gritting her teeth at my mom as I talked to her and finally my sister said What the fuck is your problem dude To which my mom said Hey no cussing And then my sister said Just talking to my name Implying that any conversation with me will devolve into her cussing at me My mom laughed School is awful I use to have good grades I was in the gifted classes up till middle school Starting getting sad all the time and lonely and my grades began to slip Went to an awful middle school my th grade year and dropped out to go to school online within a quarter of the year The next year I had to transfer over from the high school that would have taken in the middle school I went to and instead to a different school Because of my transfer student status I have to have above a C in everything and less than absences All of this was doable but my depression got worse this year as the year progressed and my grades got worse and worse and my attendance got worse Now I have three D s Two of which can be feasibly increased to a C The point being that I will most likely have to return to my jurisdiction Go to a school where I won t belong and know no one I ll miss her at school I ll get even more depressed I know I ll start to skip I ll have even less emotional support than I do now So I have no one No emotional support No sympathy from others No friends Nothing I ll probably have to move schools which is one of three connections I have to her the other being our jobs we work at the same place and social media texting I lost the one person I ve ever truly cared about and that has ever cared about me and its because of me and I hurt her I m losing passion for the one thing I think I m good at My birthday is in a month and I will have no one to make me happy All this is temporary but it shows a pattern I am mentally ill in some way I will always struggle and I am too cowardly to continue trudging if I am alone Sometimes I fantasize about running away somewhere warm and just dying alone Taking refuge in my own soul Completely unbothered by other people Not expecting the love of others Just knowingly dying by myself I ordered four books on amazon James Joyce by Richard Ellman fairy tales by ee cummings Catcher in the Rye by J D Salinger and Lust for Life by Irving Stone and I m hoping they will all come in before my birthday so I can read them beforehand If not then I will read what I can But I really don t want to keep doing this I don t like it I m not happy I don t think I ever will be nor do I think I deserve it I m just done,high,high

I m sad and the lights have gone out Idk if this matters but year old female in post secondary school diagnosed double depression social anxiety eating disorder anorexia restricting or nos it s being debated bpd which is also debated ptsd being debated with bpd and complex ptsd generalized anxiety don t know why psych hasn t mentioned this Self harm but not currently active Today I did something I never thought I would do again I turned out the lights Since September I have been unable to sleep in a completely dark room due to some scary experiences I had been having I have very bad insomnia and at the time nothing was working I would be stuck in state of extreme tiredness but mind too active to sleep Nothing seemed to help My mom gave me Nyquill to try in addition to my prescribed sleep meds that the doctor couldn t change The nyquill helped for a bit but it got to the point I was taking sips a night which is about mg mg of the drug It became too expensive and i switched to the pill form which was cheaper sleepez which also didn t help So I kept taking more and more to the point I would take up to a night at mg just so i could sleep for a few hours Of course this isn t healthy so what I was essentially doing was overdosing to the point of getting weaker and eventually passing out every night because it was the only way to sleep When I did this I would hallucinate And would lie in bed terrified of the creatures and figures that would appear in front of me Since then I have had sleep meds switched multiple times still not helping and I have not fallen asleep without a light being on since I was too afraid I would see them again as ionly saw them in the dark so I would have a light that would light up the room enough for me to see around it on everynight I always feel the need to lock my door and close my bathroom door not completely with a tiny crack in it at night I haven t been alone in the dark since then Until tonight Tonight I was lying in bed feeling overwhelmed about life and how I realized that there would never be a happy ending for me There never was going to be I told my boyfriend I wanted to have a break for a bit in reality I would just like to break up with him but I feel like his depression would get worse if I did I tried breaking it off many times over the time we have been dating But he always convinced me to give him another chance All along deep down I knew it would end in disaster I always knew I would die soon and I didn t want him to be even more hurt by me I do love him but he s holding me back from the one thing that will bring me peace The best moment of my life was last September The moments before I woke up in the hospital The moments where I couldn t see anything I was comatose Unresponsive Couldn t breathe and my blood was poisoned my stomach bleeding from the inside I had attempted suicide which would have been lethal if I had not been caught in time I don t remember doing it I don t remember the feeling of dying or the feeling of someone discovering me conscious or the emt s taking me away Nothing I wish I knew When I woke up and realized where I was My first thoughtr was I was so close I was so close to achieving what I wanted for so long It was perfect Not feeling anything having no thoughts no worries for a while I wouldn t trade that for the world Yet I was forced back into a nightmare I have been living in for years I guess you can say I m resentful of that But the doctors think I m doing better thats what matters right Everytime she says im doing better and i just stare So I must not be as bad as I was before Yet all I want now is to die I want this all to end and I know how to do it I ve been prepared for a while and have just I don t know not had the motivation I guess I ve been too tired and sick and I m tired of being sick and tired anymore I m tired of having to keep up with conversations or activities I found at least semi interesting in the past I barely go to class I mostly lie in my bed and use the computer And that I don t have paticence for anymore I can t concentrate my stomach always hurts and im starving but I don t want to eat because I ll be fat and ugly but if i don t eat my headache will get worse and I won t be able to sleep But my head always hurts and I can t sleep anymore What s the point The light is off and I m stuck in the dark and I don t think that light will ever turn on again Tell Brendon I love him And that I always loved him Maybe in another life we could have had our happy ending but it s not this one Tell my family I loved them all and that I m sorry My snuggle buddy will need someone else to sleep with now Don t let them make her sleep alone I m not afraid of them anymore They can come for me and I won t scream I won t fight I just ask that they make it quick and take me away from this hell EDIT I m using a throwaway because my boyfriend knows my main reddit account name,high,high

 While visiting my parents this weekend, I opened a box which contained painful memories. One was so many letters and cute things from my courtship with my ex-wife and mother of my child. I’ve been able to come to a place where I don’t fully blame myself for the end of my marriage. I get that it was both of us, only I did the acting out. Of course.
 
 What is more painful tonight is that my mom kept every letter my college ex girlfriend wrote me. Reading back, it’s so easy to see the pure love she had that was so hard to see then. She was also the one who took the most emotional abuse, when I was at worst and had absolutely zero self-awareness. All these letters and pics showed a genuinely good person who did not deserve any of what I subjected her to, and that is difficult.
 
 It’s been over 20 years. I since had a 14 year marriage which ended, have a ten year-old son, fell hard, and have gotten up. I have my pain, but I now manage myself better than ever. I have a partner of three years I treat well. I just feel for this woman who so clearly loved me, but got the worst of me, tonight.
 
 We last had contact in about 2005 or 2006. It was still loving and caring, inquiring about each other’s friends and families. I know she has three kids and a good life.I tried an FB message about eight years go which was never read - no assumptions made. I want to say how sorry I am. She loved me so goddamn much, but I also don’t see the use. The right thing is to cherish what I have and not repeat this a third time in my life.",medium,medium

I want to end my lifeI just need to vent I have no one I can tell this to I moved back home to my grandmas after a stressful two years of college and a failed relationship due to drug addiction on both parties We were both insanely depressed I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse I miss him so much it hurts He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard he s doing better but I ve decided to go no contact but I miss him so bad maybe I ll do minimal contact once he s feeling better I ve had suicidal thoughts in the past but it s gone out of control since moving back home My life has no direction or meaning All I do is bother everyone My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus Getting out of bed is insanely difficult Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me I know it s my head playing with me man I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it It s hard making friends and I don t want to bother my friends down here I had a decent job paying me an hour but it was insanely stressful when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me dollars an hour It s definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me My thoughts eat my alive I hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel x worse The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didn t want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end We smoked after and chatted for a bit Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours It felt so good to be high again Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore I got no sleep and my emotions are completely out of control I m usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day Housekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there I told them to call them because I was busy but they stood behind me for minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because they re english is bad and they wanted me to do it they were communicating with me just fine So I snapped and said what do you want me to do Did y all call them like i told you they said they called the gm and my boss but they didn t answer their phones and they left a voicemail So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her I said I only called her because him and the other boss didn t answer their phones and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldn t tell us to call them whenever they aren t there if we need help if they don t want to help So what s the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I can t help them and to please go away I had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling It wasn t meant to be a suicide note but I did mention how I wanted to do it Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested I want to drive far away listening to music until I m tired then I want to drive into a body of water and drown I don t know when I ll do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work I m too coward to shoot myself or hang myself I don t want my family to find me If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees I thought I closed the word document but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasn t attached to my body So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at last night and I m wondering if that is why Why else call me at that hour Maybe I m overthinking So now I m thinking should I not show up to work Maybe have a me day I don t even know how to have a self care and love day I m just too scared to go to work I don t know if anyone would even care to read this I feel so lost and lonely If anyone wants to talk I d be so happy to,high,high
"Hello fellow friends 😄
 
 I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.
 
 There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?
 
 For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 
 
 I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:
 
 ""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""
 
 To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""
 
 So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: ""There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?""",medium,low

An empty chair at all the tables Reddit I don t know There are a thousand reasons to post and a thousand more to delete these words I realize that a lot of you are here to mock people like me People that complain and I realize that there are some of us who take so much for granted Who don t see what we have and dwell in the past I realize I may be one of them though I still look in the mirror and find nothing staring back My greatest moments are the mornings that I wake and can t remember who I am or why I am where I am For a small window of time I have a lot of reasons for why I think I am the way I am and they might not be an excuse I understand that But it s the only thing I can think of to get myself through the day My dad died That s all I can start it off as From junior high up to my twentieth birthday he was an alcoholic and my mother relied on prescription medication like Atavan Methadone He was the only sane parent but we cared for my ninety six year old grandmother his parents long out of state to avoid responsibility and he lost himself in the alcohol Now that I am older I don t blame him You need one way to cope and he lost the war My mother goaded him on with her bullshit She stole from me She took credit cards out under my name We moved three times a year until we finally left state From California to Texas hoping that he would fix himself I won t forget the day he died It was Five Six days to thanksgiving We had just returned from Texas left him in a trailer he bought on his retirement because my mother talked him into it I won t forget how he reeked of piss how he d lost so much weight due to some Illness or when we d drive by the trailer park every day Take him to get groceries Clothes He d always be in the driveway drunk unconscious I hated him For beating me For not being the man I knew growing up For abandoning my sister and I when we needed him the most None of his family helped us Until the day he died My grandparents found him Dead Sober for two weeks and then we fought Told him if he forced us to give him his money he would drink and we wouldn t see him again He called the night before he died Asked my sister and I to visit him Have pudding When we arrived the duct tape was up The police were guarding the trailer and they wouldn t let me see him My grandmother his mother Hugged me Said my mother better take responsibility for what had happened I was too shocked to understand They all came flooding in Family Just for the funeral after ten years of silence Ten years of not giving a shit and suddenly they don t want pissing games A week later Thanksgiving had passed They wanted to see us for the holidays Just me and my sister Just to tell us what we did wrong What they saw when they found him How they found him And to tell us word for word That we did not try hard enough They call themselves family and until now four years later It has all been the same No one is genuine I fail at every turn Twenty three No college career The only person I care about tells me I care because they re the only person that has been kind to me for years I am only a good friend I can t come back from the debt of carrying my family while my parents were unconscious for months on the couch at seventeen I can t do anything Death is not an option It never was I am afraid of the darkness The ever lasting sleep Of pain But I want it A reason to stop because I have seen what life is What true nine to five married family every day life can do to you I don t want to do it,high,high

It gets worse beyond death y o divorced male here With one beautiful son and he s god sent That being said he is a real problem as I cannot handle the thoughts of how he will have to go through with life when I discharge a shotgun in my face I ve considered taking his life as well in order to spare him I am a completely and utterly hopeless romantic I married my ex wife after threatening to abort our child we had an abortion a year before we had our son The divorce and custody trials are still not over have lasted over years and has put me in debt to my family trust for over I met an absolutely beautiful and exquisite individual over a dating app about two months ago She fills me with joy and is the most remarkable woman I have ever met She gave many different types of messages over the past few weeks which have all been predominantly reassuring This week my emotions boiled over a bit and I told her how much I want to be with her Our phone call last night concluded with her telling me in essence that my emotional overflow has created a small rift between us and she is in need of the emotions to be removed from our equation I haven t slept all week as I ve felt like I ve been losing her due to the fact that I have baggage and am otherwise more invested in this than she is I ve looked all my life for someone like her I detest the concept of not putting all my eggs in one basket I ve already hooked up with someone else since I met her to do precisely this and I thought about her the entire time it made me hate myself and want to purify and thus has caused me to overextend my affection and quite honestly appear to not have all my ducks in a line in addition to how emotionally distraught I was in our most recent conversation I have a year degree and apply for better jobs on a daily basis but to no avail I am living in a high income area and am no better off than I was a decade ago I have a huge issue with capitalism and coming from both a conservative and military family am routinely crucified verbally for my lack of personal motivation to seek and act in ways that will project my son and I forward I have suffered from extreme depression since adolescence took every antidepressant available in high school and self medicated with marijuana for a decade I can t cope with my situation let alone another great romantic loss any more than I can cope with the fact that I ve never felt capable of overcoming the gravity of my emotions As a single parent with full custody options for seeking help are all but plentiful especially with an ex spouse eager to reverse the custody situation who also happens to be in very dire straits financially Assuming I am compromised enough to even consider the destruction of my life and even that of my sons to spare him pain my only real issue is with God As a frequent lucid dreamer and someone unable to recover from the daily perils of life through an inability to sleep without working through significant karmic events I routinely deal with the aftermath of sins such as murder am imprisoned or am otherwise finding myself in a deep state of isolated suffering when I dream I am very much aware of the fact that there exists a life in the ether and the truth is that my life in the ether is worse than it is in reality I hate God for the situation that planet earth is currently in and has been in for thousands of years I hate that I cannot be at peace having lived a life where I ve tried to be considerate of others and truly feel that there is no escape whether i commit suicide or not I ve felt this way for decades and I ve deteriorated to the point of complete anguish where I truly wish to destroy my life and the lives of others as I see the human struggle to be so fickle and grotesque my mind desires seeking the dark web to sign murder contracts and then as I let my thinking spiral I return to a state where I realize that I truly have no desire to hurt anyone but to completely erase all aspects of myself entirely No memories no essence no soul Total obliteration and liberation through the end of what has felt like truly a life of magnified suffering I don t know how to end this because again in my mind there is no end no matter what action I take but I m so sick and unorganized that it has effected each and every person involved in my life,high,high

Inevitable Turning in hrs I completely wasted my s by adapting the hermit lifestyle I stayed at home playing video games watching anime or wasting hours on end living in an MMO I think the major turning point was at or I found out that my fiance was cheating on me Not just in the normal way but picture this Imagine finding out that the wedding that your fiance is planning is not to you How did I find out On Myspace if you even remember that of all fucking places On top of that she and who I thought was my friend fucked behind my back Since then I ve turned to alcohol to numb the pain Over the last decade I ve had my share of ups and downs but the valleys have been long dark and never equaling the peaks When I was about I ended up in the hospital because of a date with Xanax and schnapps After that I was diagnosed with severe depression Fast forward to more a more present time Off antidepressants for years yr salary plus day per diem house truck getting out of debt and things are looking up right No not exactly Growing up in the lower class I ve learned that money isn t everything material possessions don t mean shit I m still alone and slowly realizing that all my chances are gone I mentioned earlier about the whore but that wasn t my only encounter with love I ve been involved with two others but one only used me for sex and the other just got away Just to make things fun lets throw in candidate number four Someone whom seemed like a perfect match Smart pretty shared the same hobbies Yeah you know the catch is coming She was engaged to my best friend On top of that they were living with me After a long and emotionally draining love triangle I accepted what was happening and they got married and eventually moved out I haven t talked to either of them in years Lets come a little closer to the present day about months ago the one who absolutely destroyed me texted me Stupidly I carried the conversation I mean I thought I was finally moving on The messages eventually stopped until two months ago I can t remember if I made contact or if she did I knew that this is a toxic situation and I should ve distanced myself from it but I just couldn t help myself About a month ago I came the closest I have ever been to actually taking my own life sending apology messages to my mom and sisters The last thing I want to do is cause my family grief Now to me sitting in a hotel writing this sorry sob story Conversations with my ex continue knowing there will never be a future between us Absolutely no self esteem to even look for anyone Let alone a tinder account that has gone nowhere The feeling to finally end it is getting stronger by the day I m at wits end here I travel of the year so the comfort of home is a rare escape that I almost never have and I think it would be so much easier for a stranger to be found dead in any given community that I am found in I just thought it would be nice for someone even just a random person on the internet to read just a small portion of this fucked up dream before it is forever silenced,high,high

Think I have finally mentally snappedThis week has strangely been the one to push me over I finally got a chance to hear from my biological family Don t expect anyone to understand how it felt to see and hear them for the first time in a year When I left they had no idea of the real reasons My mother tainted them all with vile lies about me This week they all head and saw the truth but I m not sure if they can realise the whole truth Been in quarantine since early March before the official lock down It has destroyed and torn my mental health apart Every inch of progress I made has gone The darkness has won and consumed me by now I can t keep wearing a mask It s full of cracks holes and crumbling away Even a simple disagreement lead to a massive break down for me Ended in tears I couldn t control nor feel I want to honestly say fuck this Give me a gun so I can end myself Give me anything to end this I don t want to fight anymore I m done with this bullshit of a life All I m doing is ruining everyone else s lives I don t want to drink eat or sleep it s a waste of time and resources I can t see myself living till the end of the year It s shit how whenever I feel anything I mindlessly cry I want this hell to end,high,high
I hate myself and this worldOn my main I got into an argument on another sub with a bunch of guys celebrating about suicide rates among a group of people I said it was disgusting and that I wouldn t wish suicide on my worst enemy They called me a pussy and pathetic I see so much hate and ignorance everywhere It makes me depressed Nobody bothers to think rationally or educate themselves it seems Do people just wish the worst for anyone that disagrees with them now Then there s the people and animals around the world that are suffering And the people around the world that are just evil I saw an article recently about KIDS who did some truly horrific things to some animals Then there s me I hate myself so much For countless reasons I want to go inpatient but it costs so much money and I am not worth that much That money could be used for something much better,medium,high
How do you describe how bad you feel xpost from r getting over itI am AWFUL at putting how I feel into words A lifetime of trying to hide my mental illness from others and distract myself from how terrible I feel has left me with an inability to explain it to others and a skewed idea of what normal is amp nbsp Long story short I was diagnosed with Major Depression and General Anxiety disorder at I m now and was later diagnosed with Chronic Major Depression Recently I was rediagnosed with Cyclothymia like bipolar lite I guess which I had never even heard of My new psychiatrist said that the S S R I s I ve beem taking most of my life are like fighting fire with gasoline Shit I think this could have been avoided if I knew how to identify my symptoms and talk about the specifics of how I feel amp nbsp Anyways the main reason I m asking is because I had to bail on another social thing this weekend because I was having a can t even get out of bed to feed myself kind of day My boyfriend was concerned and a little upset that I didn t go with him He stopped by and could see that I obviously wasn t going to be able to go but assumed I was sick Like not mentally sick but the kind of sick that makes sense to people who haven t had a mental illness amp nbsp When he was asking what was wrong I was at a total loss about how to explain it to him I ve had some really intense suicidal urges lately but I ve chosen not to tell him about that for a number of reasons I ve only told my therapist and psychologist Once someone knows my dark secret it will color how they see me as a person for the rest of our relationship I don t want any of that and I also don t want people to walk on eggshells around me Also I just don t think I have the courage to say Oh I ve just had a nonstop loop of intrusive suicidal thoughts for the past months that has left me beyond exhausted and hanging on to my sanity by a thread out loud amp nbsp However feeling suicidal isn t the only thing I m feeling right now that hurts I just don t know how to explain it in a way that other people will understand or in a way that doesn t make me sound completely nuts amp nbsp When I try to put words to how a rough day with depression cyclothymic whatever the fuck i really have feels it ends up sounding really weird and vague and not something I d want to tell other people who don t get it a k a basically everyone amp nbsp It kind of feels like a constant stream of painful disgust that is welling up in my chest and neck and head The only way I can think of to describe this feeling sorry this is about to sound super weird is like imagining there are worms thousands of them churning inside my chest and throat It s beyond gross it s inside me part of me I can feel them wriggling but there is absolutely nothing I can do about them So I have two choices ignore them the best I can and distract myself somehow by getting high as fuck unconscious or sometimes games or movies will work short term or think about them and completely lose my shit because it s so confusing and horrible amp nbsp If I choose the distraction route everything gets foggy it s basically impossible to think deeply about anything I either get monkey mind and feverishly flit from one superficial thought to the next or get really dissociative and spaced out Everything aches and feels heavy moving feels like trying to walk upstream in a strong fast current I feel ugly and angry and worthless and like a genuinely bad person who needs stay hidden I want everyone to just fuck off and leave me alone because it s impossible to explain how I m feeling while I m feeling this way Not being able to convincingly tell people that I can t handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying just adds another layer of shit to deal with amp nbsp So anyway if you re willing to share I d love to hear how you describe how you feel It can be how you describe it to yourself or your therapist if you have one your friends significant other whoever Don t worry about sounding weird you might end up striking a chord with someone else or coming to a new realization if you re brutally honest I really think being able to put words to how we feel will help us feel less alone and help gain insight into our symptoms amp nbsp TL DR Words are hard especially when you re mentally emotionally whateverly compromised How do you explain how you feel,high,high

It just seems like the right idea at the moment Hi reddit I ve lurked a while and things in my life have lately come to a fever pitch I feel trapped by everything and I don t feel like I live in a world where I m truly free anymore My relationships are burning me alive and even my friendships feel porous and deceitful I could use the kind words cause I know there are no answers I included my poetry I don t know why I guess to seem like an individual worth encouraging I can t escape the overriding feeling that everything in my life is rotting Thanks for your time I m a well traveled man with a stride and a plan to wander less near from so far But nothing I will see or ever have seen beats back the Big Bang in my yard See Williker Tidds who lived with his kids was a bootlegger hot off the south and when prohibition brought in inhibition Ol Williker whistled his mouth and said Jesus H Christ boy these people these people All looking for just a load off Now run back and forth and stay drunk on the sly While the cops they retreat from the law And though the money all goes up the expenses hose What if one could handle the weight Could one make such a still that its liquor would fill Every Sub Mason Dixon Line State Well Jehosephat Joe I know just where to go there s a rock that fell out of the sky And its shiny and hard and not an inch of its charred even though ten foot round the brush died And the sound it creates when you hit it or knock it is softer than you think it would And the air doesn t smell like there s burning in fact the scent surrounding s quite good But its steel like and feels like a distant vibration a rail for a train yet to come And its cold as a spring even though the damn thing is just cookin right there in the sun So he brought in a team and they all got the rock to sit stark on the back of his trailer And he hammered and blacksmithed and worked on great sheets of the asteroid thinner and paler And with tireless zeal and a few hurried meals Tidds fashioned a splendid machine And he stuffed it with grains and he churned up a batch that he knew would be sweet strong and clean But when the day came to cash in on his game Williker gasped cause he wasn t sure If inside of the still floating round in the mash was a light so bright and so pure that a glance would set ones imagination on fire and the soul too would in rapture burn For the colors contained in that shimmer or glimmer would take a gods mind just to learn And he swallowed and watched with a glow on his face and a helpless look right in his eyes He said Mercy what what is that and then went inside and turned off the light But at night he rest stubbornly and the thoughts in his head Ran around in insomniac roar And when he sat on the edge of the foot of his bed The light glowed outside of his door With a start he stood up and ran right to his still which emitted a casual hum and the light that shot out from the top of the tank lit the night like a placebo sun And his shout was so loud that was wife the old cow woke and waddled outside just to yell But the second she saw what dropped Willikers jaw then so too Etnas jaw promptly fell For the tank had been melting for quite a long time and the whiskey had boiled away And the brand new universe just sat there shining at the end of its very first day Theres a lot going on in universe spawn some things that you really can t know Like the sound planets make when theyre bumping and thumping as the galaxies they re inside grow And the trillion quarks making zillions of sparks as they bristle and crystal collide And the nebulas blooming and supernovas booming for young stars are too doomed to die And just hanging in air over two wide eyed stares the universe gained dimension and size And its growth was quite slow But quite steady and so in a year the Tidds moved lest they died For their house had been burned by a baby red giant like a superball coated with lava And their vase was erased by tiny black hole and some meteors got on the guavas And the living conditions grew dimmer and dimmer in the town where Williker lived And as land was devoured while men scattered and cowered People knew that something had to give For insurance adjusters had no clue what to write when the house was clearly just gone and replaced by universe golden and glowing and taking more insured houses on Then the government came with their titles and names and declared the small town a lost cause And in haste the whole state had to evacuate said the brand new ex states new state laws And for year after year the grand spectacle grew Until Tennessee was just an orb That hung twinkling high like a jewel in the sky Looking for a new state to absorb And slowly we retreat with the back of our feet hot from The Fires of Wondrous Creation But we all kinda wish that the need for the booze hadn t set up our own immolation For the commune we live in at the edge of the world while it numbers a billion strong Loses faith as the land that we have slips away and may be gone before way too long But there s hope in my heart for the world and its arts because the future is exceedingly bright For inside of the Big Bang the suns live so close that their day is no different from night And I m not really scared I m in love with my fate swallowed whole by the future constructive But maybe sometimes in the back of my mind i wish drinking was much less destructive,high,medium

A rant about something I d loved but left because of circumstances This is gonna be a long rant because nobody irl really cares at this point I apologise in advance if it upsets anyone or gets too negative I m stuck in a miserable moment right now Have you ever had that one thing that you loved but left behind yet still think of Every Fucking Day It would be tennis for me I stopped playing it three three and a half years back and I still miss it every single day I changed academies thrice before ultimately leaving the sport altogether even though I loved it so fucking much and was lost without playing it It started to get associated with unpleasant memories and pathetic conversations and just it was bad I ve tried going into another sports like swimming boxing mma but ever have that one thing that ruined you for everything else Those sports were great but they couldn t quite match up to the spot that tennis had and will always have in my heart Every time when I score good or win an award or something all of my relatives start asking what I want for a gift that I have to say the name and they ll get it and internally I m just like Please get me a good coach Someone who isn t fucking four hours away or cares about how much I weigh or will go to the extent of breaking my racquet because I didn t buy one from their relative Literally all I want is ONE coach to actually care about me and my game Who doesn t give a fuck about me being a girl or that I am a kilogram above below what they want me to weigh who is genuinely invested in improving my game I will honestly go to hell and back for them but fuck man just ine nice coach I really can t blame anyone my family both immediate and extended tried I m very very thankful that they cared enough but the distance was too much to travel in a single day going and returning I still play once every few months Usually I m just in my room shadowing movements Sometimes I get in these bitter and sad spells but y know shit happens and that s that Either way I hope you have a nice day,medium,medium

If you were would you want to live If you were me Ok I m I used to study medicine but that didn t work out Then I got a job in the city which I loved and a few months later everything changed I was Basically I started hearing a voice never did drugs or anything and I had this voice control me ever since I know it sounds like a bad movie but this voice can control everything I do and say It made me lose my job It stopped me going to the gym and being healthy It makes me smoke every day It doesn t let me get another job or talk to a girl or exercise My life is watching tv twitter reddit all night until am in the morning Then waking up at pm and going out to get a coffee alone Then watching t v again until am the next day Medication has been tried and doesn t help I saw a psychologist but I guess it was too much for her because she said she wasn t experienced enough lol So imagine right now you can no longer work be in love you have to smoke which you don t want to and you can t exercise Your life is tv It s like a prison Would you want to live like that It s not enough for me I have a loving family and a couple of friends but it s just not enough I want a job and my own place and love but I will never have it because this voice won t let me Btw thankfully this voice has never made me do anything illegal or dangerous,medium,medium
I feel ready but I m not brave I m ready to go now I feel it I imagine this is what older people feel like I feel like I have lived this long life but that s because it s been hard I have PTSD I m a pussy though cuz I never went to war just with myself and my life Every time I cry it bring back every other time I ve cried and every bad feeling that came with that crying so whenever I do it it goes out of control I m in a relationship thing and I m not sure if I m being abused or if I m abusive l it s probably both but when I say we should separate I m a evil person it s not like he wants the same life I want I m not even sure why I m writing this I m definitely not going to be here in years I have this feeling that me trying to get a second degree and a better career will still not work out in my favor as it didn t with the associates in business or working in mental health I want to do it right now but I m so scared but I need to be with my grandmother she loved me the best and I ve missed her this past years She left me here like this though so I m mad oh and on top of everything I m a black female HAHAHAHAH what a wonderful life to be living now at days google says black woman are the least desirable of all women and we still fall behind Asian men on this spectrum my dad has never been a good parent to me because I made a bad decision to not live with him at and I have like no friends of my race because I m not the average so I can even find any sameness in my race I feel like I have to prove I m black enough to receive black love and community it makes me anxious if I can t afford to tip because I am black my hair fell out too I could keep going but I m feeling like crying now and I m supposed to wait at least more years but idk if I can that long maybe I ll be brave someday,medium,high

I just had the strangest reddit argument so far So on my alt account I started a discussion about a game and that one dude wrote an entire essay with Caps Lock and each other word being a swear insulting me I barely understood it but managed to make out his actual points and replied without being toxic It went on and Im pretty sure he broke his caps lock Finally someone backed me up telling the guy to stop being unnecessarilly toxic I replied to the nice guy and tagged the toxic one saying it is good advice and asking why was he toxic in the first place He then replied and quoted Sun Tzus Art of War about using effifient tactics against enemies I m not sure wether to laugh my ass off or be worried about him not being in aggression therapy,low,low
I don t now why I just suddenly got angry I was browsing r crushes and found a post about somebody s cat dying and her crush just saying I m a dog person and crap That reminded me of a story of my own I went on a trip to Sudan with my family we lived in this huge house because river there we were pretty wealthy and if you ever went there you now there would be multiple wild cats So there was this little cat we found in our house it was drinking some water that we had soon it feel asleep under some wood While it was asleep we took it inside our house when it was awake it was quite scared and didn t trust us but after we gave it some food and water it started getting comfy with us We kept it vaccinated it gave it shelter food and water the normal stuff for pets Until my shit sister dropped my cat she smacked it and It didn t get back up though after a while I saw it in our room on my bed sleeping next to me though we I got up it started running as my parents yelled at me to get it out of the house I refused they forcefully threw my cat out of the house she came back running to me they grabbed it again and closed the door quickly I looked for her later but she was gone And about year later My parents chose to show my a completely different cat and claimed it to be my cat I could imagine it being killed by dogs or dying somehow but MY PARENTS COULDNT BE NORMAL AND DECIDED TO SHOW ME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CAT And what did I do I stayed quiet because my dad would ve yelled at me or just kept trying to say it s the same cat This pissed me off and I am in bed right now with my pillow full with tears I just want to say to you pet owners out there keep em safe because you won t know how long they ll last Bye,medium,medium

F Verbally Abusive Ex and A Poorly timed ReboundI m not entirely sure where to begin only in that it s been almost months since I broke up with my ex of years Throughout those years he was verbally abusive often yelling at me telling me my thoughts made no sense and were stupid and then often neglecting or abandoning when I need help During those years I had miscarriages my father passed away almost a year ago now I had a cancer scare and have been told it is likely I will not be able to have children I ve remained strong throughout these crises but now it seems to be all coming to a head I broke up with my ex in October because I had enough with being forgotten and neglected He was often flirting with another girl and spending a lot of time with her When we broke up I felt like it was only a matter of time before he started dating her because of this I made a dumb mistake and started dating one of my really good friends whom I ve known for about years He is absolutely fantastic and understanding and yet I feel nothing I am numb I got accepted into graduate school I ve taken up about different hobbies and I ve got to make some deeper connections with old friends and family I m also seeing a therapist Nothing seems to be helping I miss my ex desperately I am moving out of my current apartment and all of his old stuff which I m throwing out has caused me to break down again and again I don t really feel anything right now I just want to escape all of this I know time is supposed to help heal but I ve just been feeling trapped and alone I ve talked with friends and my current bf nothing helps take away the pain I feel I just feel like a fuck up like I lost all purpose in my life Please just talk to me,medium,medium

Never thought I would use this years old addicted to heroin and meth for almost months now Last month I became the caregiver for my mother who was in a nursing home with a disability Due to her memory problems and nobody in charge of her care watching over her finances she was eventually given eviction notice I took over as her primary caregiver as there was no one else and I wanted her to be home I m not I that was the right thing to do A month and half later she now lives in neglect My girlfriend who is living with me mishandled my mothers finances this month I put her in charge of that I view it as my fault I ve also used her money for heroin and meth It s essentially all gone no bills are paid I was planning to go to inpatient treatment due to probation yesterday but my ride fell through and I don t see a chance of having one in time to satisfy probation and not be dope sick upon receiving suboxone Right now I m not seeing this as fixable In addition to current situation I have extreme anxiety which cannot be properly medicated due to my drug use I ve tried to receive adequate care for years I m non functional now I also have a month old son I love very much He s the only person or thing I can think of that brings me to tears Waiting to be sure my girlfriend and mother are totally asleep At that point I ll be taking a shower and dressing in comfortable clothes Then I ll be going to the basement which is equipped with a storm door If I find it too hard to cut myself and die of blood loss I ll be hanging myself I ll be sure to leave a note that states to take my body out through the basement door instead of up the stairs through the living room so my mother won t see my body being taken away My girlfriend will find me I would have more to say but when you realize these are your last minutes hour it s hard to bust your brain for an internet post,high,high
