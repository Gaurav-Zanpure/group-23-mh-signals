Oh where to begin I ve been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth This caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird out there bad ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me But I just shrugged it off and kept on going Then in middle school I started getting bullied couldn t walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy Then I was homeschooled in th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit But I just kept going And then in th grade I went back to school and finally made friends People still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me But I actually made friends Then in high school everything got better at first I had tons of friends who I considered family I wasn t being bullied to my face And I was actually happy Then my second year of high school started and BOOM insomnia I became extremely irritable I was sleeping in class wasn t shaving dressing like shit and so on Well I didn t know this at the time but my cyclothymia lesser version of bipolar disorder had kicked into th gear What makes matters worse is I was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist So I was getting medication But can you guess what meds I was getting Just anti depressants And for those who don t know ADs cyclothymia or bipolar disorder in my case hypomania What fun Basically for years I was mostly hypomanic I m sure you can all guess what this was like Well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance this got mistook for narcissism And a certain true narcissist didn t like this So he went around to all my friends who I considered family and told them I was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me Which of course I didn t I saw almost all of them as my equal And then it gets better he decided to assume that I was also a liar because I mentioned that I fell into a firepit when I was a kid and melted my hand together But there s no scar So I must be lying Even tho it did really happen I ll find a way to prove it to you if you don t believe me He told everyone this So practically overnight my family was gone My insomnia had gotten to the point where I was staying awake from straight hours and to cope I turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep The fallout is obvious So I m left alone addicted to xanax going fucking mad from sleep deprivation and I dropped out of high school months later I had a nervous breakdown cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder I start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls Smoking tons of weed to cope Struggling with xanax and ativan And I have no one Not a single person What s the point None of you will read this far down my rambling to read this I ruined everything But no I m apparently not allowed to be happy or have friends I just ruin everything,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I need to get this out of my chest Well hello I don t even know how to start this post but I will try I have been lurking this sub for some months now it has helped me a lot to forget about my situation but I can t keep running from this and I really don t have anyone to talk about this so I m going to try and vent a little in here and maybe it ll manage to be therapeutic Everything started a few years ago and I don t want to bore you with all the details about my life those are more suited for a psychologist but the gist of it is that I have always been hated all my friends tend to treat me like trash and even some teachers and family members did this so I started to become a cynic while I got left out and started to live life in solitude All of this didn t really bother me it was so typical that I just started to normalize it until eventually I became very depressed Alone and with no one to trust everything started to fall down on me my life broke apart and I desperately tried to cling to something to keep finding meaning a reason to live the sad thing is that all of that wasn t the tip of the iceberg I just kept holding on trying to be strong only to be met by weakness It started to get worse as I entered High school everyone found groups meaning something while I got left out once again Eventually I managed to find some friends that still treated me horrible they hit me and verbally abuse me I kind of drifted apart from them as the year started but the pandemic happened I went inside my house I stopped seeing people they stopped talking to me on a regular basis and I just got left alone once again At first it wasn t hard but life kept on going strong with me time and time again it kept dealing low blows the months kept advancing and I just felt like I was stuck in a blurry mist where everything just sucked We fast forward a bit probably around months or so where I started to show symptoms of a disease called APL I don t want to enter to much detail but basically I get micro infarcts in my brain and it s practically a miracle that I haven t lost my speech ability or my walking ability It s just random anything could happen ranging from hallucinations to turning into a vegetable And well I got diagnosed weeks ago my life style had to change and I lost the few things that helped me hold on to life those little hobbies that helped me escape for a few moments from reality they are just gone now and I don t have a clear picture any longer of how to keep going The weird thing is that I m not scared probably the only thing preventing me from ending it all is my stubbornness to admit defeat against a life that put plenty of cards against me So that s why I m writing this essay here today I just felt like no one could help me anymore so I m relying in complete strangers to help me grasp my new reality and well yeah keep on going Maybe this isn t the right community to write this but I just hope that I can find some way to find meaning to life And well if you managed to get here and didn t get bored with my life I thank you for reading me I know it doesn t mean much coming from a complete stranger but I can t offer anything else so sorry so yeah this is the post I hope I can some day find something but until then I guess I m going to just say goodbye and thank you Thanks for coming to my ted talk,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

just a little vent I really just needed to talk to someone aha sorry if it s the wrong flair I m new here so about two years ago I got diagnosed with minor autism at first I didn t think much of it as it wouldn t change who I was and it never will but others didn t think the same I ve always had troubles with school I don t think it s difficult I just think it s incredibly boring like so boring I would rather do anything else in the world than go there so I ve spent most of my school days at home rather than at school and now finally my parents had something to blame it on don t get me wrong I love my parents they re really nice but they seem to not understand that all their comments about my autism being the cause for all of this hurt me almost every single adult I ve met who knows about my autism seems to assume that I must have troubles with EVERYTHING just because I m autistic it s always annoyed me but for the past few months I just can t take it anymore I don t hate myself I love who I am but I hate my autism if everyone stopped making such a big deal out of it then I would live the perfect life not really but much better than this hellhole every time someone comments on it I m close to breaking out in tears because of how done I am every time they tell me something new I have troubles with I don t understand how they always forget about everything I DONT have troubles with they NEVER talk about the good things about me only bad things I literally taught myself English from just staring at a computer screen all day school didn t teach me anything but no that s not important cause I must be a complete idiot because I have this label under my name I cry myself to sleep almost every single night just thinking about how much better my life would be if I wasn t like this and I know you might just say but just go to school it ll fix your problems thats not gonna help I don t even know why I don t go most of the time I just can t anyways thanks for tuning in today for anjas ted talk have a nice day,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

The worst most meaningless life is still better than no life at all At least you still have the chance to do the things you love Even if it s only eating your favorite cereal in the morning watching that tv show book you love so much over and over again and waiting for the next sequel falling asleep while listening to the rain drawing at am while drinking your favorite tea etc etc I guess what I m trying to say is life is not to be seen as a whole Life is the little moments you love so much you look forward to everyday YOUR little moments MAKE life If someone would ask you what you love about life those little things would probably not even cross your mind because you see them as meaningless But then again what exactly has meaning in life Everything is meaningless Feeling content while doing the things you like doing is at least for me the ultimate form of happiness and meaningfullness And one can only be happy while alive,Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous

My friend is slowly getting worse and has made threats to kill himself I m not sure what steps to take Hi everyone Best wishes to everyone and I m so sorry that anyone has to go through what you all have gone through I myself have thankfully been able to get out of my own depression and am now in a better place My friend however just seems to be getting worse He s only Just turned a few months ago actually Lately he s been making threats I wouldn t call them threats but the word that I m looking for escapes me and saying things like if my dad s gun case wasn t locked I don t know what I would do and things of that nature very very openly to me He said once that he might do it soon if things don t get better I ask him why and he says I just can t deal with it anymore He s been very reckless lately When he was younger at around or so he got his hands on some strong prescription pain killers and benzodiazepines which he stole from family and his parents Ever since then he s loved the idea of getting more He hasn t tried any pharmaceutical opiates in years but I guess for some people the feeling just can t ever be forgotten Then he found out about Kratom Kratom is great and for responsible users it s a godsend I use it myself every once in a while and it s fantastic Great for pain and sleep Ever since he got some he s started abusing it It started out as something he did every once in a while but within a week he had said f it and started using it every time something went wrong in his life He uses it as a crutch if you will One day I passively mentioned phenibut and then he suddenly ordered some I deeply regret that He abuses this now too Phenibut is a nootropic that has anti anxiety characteristics It s notorious for its rebound anxiety and withdrawal after being abused I honestly don t know how much he s used of Phenibut but he s had some pretty bad anxiety now that he says he s off of it Now he has been talking about getting some strong pharmaceutical opiates again I tried to tell him that that road might not lead him to happiness and that he could prossibly be worse in the long run but he just retorted with isn t the goal of life to have as much fun as possible and be as happy as possible I tried to reason with him and say no the goal is the be fully happy with the situation you re in without the use of substances I may have been wrong it s fine to seek help from substances But he hasn t seen a psychiatrist or anything so at this point he s self medicating and poorly at that He s always struggled with depersonalization derealization as well And he says it s been getting worse In my opinion I think the substances he s been testing with may be making him worse in the long run He doesn t seem to want help though There s other stuff that I won t list here one of which I think could possibly be messing up his brain s dopamine system but he doesn t even want to try stopping it I mean if it could help and you re pretty desparate why not But I m not him and he s probably in a completely different headspace than I m in Also he has a LOT of anxiety stemming from the fact that he ll need to be going to college soon and honestly I feel like he s still very much a kid inside His parents gave him the option of waiting one year but he saw his other friend just decide not to go to college after getting a well paying job during his gap year Reading through this post I m pretty sure that I m not looking at all of this from the right perspective It s been a long time since I was in a situation similar to his so I m having trouble putting the shoes on the other foot so I apologize,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Here s my rant about being miserable and depressed It helps to write it out even if it makes me cry more Basically everyone but my boyfriend and parents think I m pretty much fine including my professors school friends My boyfriend knows I m extremely depressed and suicidal and my parents know I m as bad as I was when I was which implies the same My therapist probably knows I m suicidal but I promised myself years ago when it was this bad before I d never go to a mental hospital again voluntarily because it s extremely traumatic for me I stopped seeing her because I don t want her to involuntarily commit me Specifically going between now and early January is an over my dead body type option because I ve been procrastinating grad school applications and need to finish them all by early January Going to the mental hospital literally rips away my support system and coping mechanisms completely such as talking to my boyfriend going on Reddit playing video games listening to people on discord sleeping as much as I want eating food I like etc The hospital also makes it so I might not be able to graduate from college on time or get bad grades which would mean I d have to reapply to graduate programs which would be enough to make me actually do it I m a good student and have a and a in my major which is great I have a really competitive internship in my field of study lined up for the spring in addition to my prior related work experience I love my field and feel like I m actually helping people My professors love me and almost all of them are willing to give me a letter of recommendation for grad school which is great The problem is no one would fucking believe that I m constantly suicidal and taking a semester off isn t an option I have a disability hearing or whatever it s called in March I m scared it s going to come out that I m very suicidal and I ll be sent off to the hospital again Like I m in a catch be re traumatized and potentially have to go to the hospital again and not graduate on time or have them not understand the gravity of the situation The guy who s the judge clearly doesn t get mental health stuff in my opinion based on previous times I ve talked with him It s like either go full NEET be hospitalized not regulate myself and they take me seriously or try to make a future for myself and be less suicidal and they don t take me seriously at all Being able to hold down easy credits of coursework that requires maybe hours of work a day and hrs a week internship isn t the same as being able to hold down a hour a week job My boyfriend is fucking incredible and the most supportive person aside from my parents I ve ever met I can t imagine life without him The problem is I feel so utterly inadequate because he has a physical disability that makes it so I have to do a lot of the chores like taking out the trash doing dishes etc yet I have fucking meltdowns that I can t control like crying fits if I m asked to do almost anything most of the time I get so short with him and lose it over tint stuff because I m so constantly miserable It s not intentional at all and I love him so much and do my best to be supportive of him I m so afraid of losing him yet I can t fucking control myself He can work and stuff thankfully at least and works in a well paying industry that he is really talented at I ve probably gained lbs in years easily from depression eating I went from pretty toned hourglass shape lifting weights x a week and walking tons around lbs at and about a size to now maybe a size x and lbs I m covered in unappealing stretch marks I haven t brushed my hair in a month or two so it s extremely tangled and knotted I struggle to brush my teeth I wear dirty clothes for weeks at a time I shower maybe once every three weeks I wish I was kidding I have very little interest in sex or anything like that but I try to at least once a week initiate something with my boyfriend because I don t want him to leave me He basically says it s not necessary to do this but I just don t want him to leave me I have a lot of weed because I m in a legal state temporarily and it s one of the only things that helps I don t take other medication because since covid I literally can t remember to especially not twice a day Also the old medication made me have shitty side effects like being difficult to orgasm sleep hrs a day made me extremely nauseous and didn t really help that much with my mood I ve tried basically every medication in the book I have a really weird case and rarely get concrete diagnoses I think I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder if I had to guess after being a former psych major for a while plus the diagnosis I ve heard from former psychiatrists But I ve also been encouraged to be tested for autism by a psychiatrist which I also think could explain a ton That s basically how I ve been doing It kinda helped a little to write out my feelings so thank

I m sick of all the bullshitHello I am a year old Marine Veteran and a Korean American No ones going to read this shit but I wanted some place to vent my anger and frustration I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar type and am very anti social to the extent that I have only spoken two words for six months I barely post or write online I try to improve myself with empirical evidences in mood enhancement such as exercising trying new hobbies taking cold showers and taking social classes to improve my awkwardness with other people Yet even with these initiations I am looked with hate and dread from the other students at Penn State York Campus My professors who are psychology professionals look and behave as if I am a retarded deficient human being Often they would skip or cut short of my input during seminars and other students would groan in silence I still hear it everytime I talk I feel I don t belong but I need these classes to fucking graduate I have committed numerous acts of suicide on various occasions I used methods such as overdosing on someone else s prescribed sleeping pills hanging myself with a noose and attempting to jump off a bridge I push any relationships away because of the fear of getting emotionally damaged and being used When they proceed to ignore me I blame myself because I believe I do not deserve good people in my life yet I want a social connection My family rejects any conversations when I feel depressed and feel suicidal They proceed to get furious and tell me to shut the fuck up I do not have any friends literally and I am fucking tired of these emotional rollercoaster rides monthly I tried to fit in with the Americans but they berate me because of my skin color in Pennsylvania state of brotherly love my ass I tried to make friends with Koreans but they cast me away for being too individualistic rather than having a collectivistic mindset like them I feel like an ignorant unintelligent bigot with no future because I live at home with my father while paying for the house and utilities I m tired of no progress the stupid fucking lie that life gets better and i am tired of hope Also if you are from Penn State York and reading this which I highly doubt FUCK YOU I ll see you in hell,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I don t know how to dream anymore and I want to give upI don t know what happened but around the time I was something clicked in me Within a day I completely lost my ability to dream about a future I stopped trying in school I lost normal habits showering regularly cleaning my room brushing my teeth and lost all responsibility under the impression I was never going to grow up so there s no use keeping those habits Now I m and I completely fucked myself over I don t have any social skills don t have a job fuck I barely even have teeth anymore because I haven t brushed them in so long half of them are broken or corroded No matter how much I tell myself I want and need to get help I know I ll never be able to push myself to get the help I need Everything became so much worse when last year I ignored a friend who desperately wanted and needed help because I felt too awkward around someone who was just as depressed as I am and they ended up killing themselves which I ve blamed myself for for days straight and now I straight up hate the one person who was there for me through it all All I can do is distract myself from the bad thoughts by watching videos and playing video games I even force myself to take large doses of sleeping pills to the point where I can t even feel my own face because if I m left alone with my thoughts sober I start to convince myself that it isn t worth it anymore I know this is all taking a huge toll on my mother because she s forced to support me through all of this but whenever I consider if I should at least get a job I worry the added pressure will just push me over the edge I don t remember what happened to me when I suddenly changed like that but whatever it was took away my ability to dream took away my drive for living and all my passions and I just wish I could go back in time and prevent it from ever happening,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Progress Update, Seeking Help"
Feeling on the vergeI ve been dealing with my depression off and on for a little over a decade I m now and have started taking anti depressants again Celexa after taking them for the first time when I was My stomach is pretty weak and the meds Effexor before took their toll on my body causing almost daily morning nausea which just brought me lower and lower so I stopped after a few weeks Currently dealing with the same symptoms after starting it up again and it s absolutely crushing me My suicidal thoughts have become almost daily now and its wearing me down I started a job last year as a part of my school program that I absolutely love and is a great fit for my lifestyle flexible hours independence When I worked there as part of the school program I was the happiest I had been in a long time not remembering more than a day or two I was down the entire month span I was there Coming back to school has brought back my moods and I feel as if I have checked out emotionally mentally from thinking about school which is causing me a lot of problems with trying to finish my classes I ve failed multiple classes in the past due to mostly laziness on my part but even now that I ve been given a second chance to retake them I m throwing the opportunity out the window I opened up recently to my fiancee about my thoughts and she is obviously concerned and made a comment about noticing my behaviour since we resumed school She wants me to continue and even my boss said it would be better for me in the long run if I decide to look elsewhere for work but we have already discussed about me staying there for a few years of work at least I want to do right by my fiancee and even my mom I want to make them proud and graduate but I can t keep my head above water I feel like I am constantly sinking and watching myself helplessly struggle Nights are spend yelling at myself in my head about things I should be doing but i can t seem to muster the strength to follow through and work on things I know I need to These constant suicidal thoughts grown from my depression are ruining me some days making it so I can t even leave the house let alone my office which is my usual recluse space I m lost and want to make everyone happy and proud of me but I just want to give up,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

am I the cause of my own demise Never posted on here before and I m not sure why I feel the urge to now I used to cut myself all the time in my head I did it for attention I wanted people to notice and ask me if I was okay so I could say that I wasn t and they safely tuck me away in a hospital for crazies and the doctors would spend months trying unsuccessfully to break through my emptiness The reality was that I was so scared of people seeing my cuts that I hid them the best I could despite having hundreds at any one time my family had no idea until I flipped out at school I was sitting in some stupid class I think we had a relief teacher it was a class where you could sit and talk with your friends and do nothing and the teacher wandered around doing sweet fuck all I don t know why but I grabbed a Stanley knife and sliced into my arm multiple times I remember it stinging so bad because there were so many lighter cuts underneath them I laughed I felt like I had something to prove A boy saw the blood and told the teacher she came over and I said he was lying but she wouldn t leave me alone so I pulled up my jumper sleeve and screamed at her to fuck off as I ran out I don t remember what happened next but my parents were told about it and I d left the school grounds The school councillor found me and for some reason I agreed to go with him to hospital He took me to be evaluated by a child shrink I barely said a word and I didn t look at him once I felt like I was in a trance the air around me felt so cold and heavy It was decided that I was perfectly sane and didn t need any sort of help what so ever The councillor took me home and my parents asked to see my cuts before never mentioning it ever again So anyway I continued to lead a destructive lifestyle most weekends were spent wiping myself out with a bottle of straight bourbon or vodka I hung out at local music gigs with my friends many of them much much older than myself I did things to the extreme because it made me popular not always in a good way I went out of my way to stand up for my behaviour so if someone in our extended friends circle thought I was a dick I d push and push until their close friends liked me and they d eventually give in and treat me nicely too Meanwhile I was a straight A student my parents worked a lot they didn t pay much attention to my schooling my grades weren t bad so they didn t give it a second thought In fact they saw me as being responsible I often babysat my little sisters one of them from when she was only a few months old I wouldn t abandon them or throw parties or anything but I did play horrible mind games with them and they d never tell because I d scared them into believing that was worse than whatever I d tricked them into thinking had happened was happening All of this stuff it was selfish I wanted to be the rebellious renegade cool kid but my parents and to a point my teachers were fed this bullshit goody two shoes image that they fell for This is how I got away with never doing my hometown handing in essays late wearing incorrect uniform everyday never doing exams never paying attention spending most of my time in the classroom yelling and laughing and making excuses Looking back I can honestly say that I am amazed at how much shit I got away with and that I finished school I found comfort in typing to a select few male friends for hours upon hours I often developed crushes on them but they never went much further than sex i was young and they were often in their early s One guy in particular sticks in my head not sexually or anything we never even went there back then in fact he broke his hand after punching a tree at his birthday party because he felt so bad that I was so attached to him at the time So that was my first real broken heart our friendship was awkward for a while and then I moved away and we have barely spoke since As a teenager I threw massive tantrums but I didnt realise the extent of them until the last few years when I discovered that I have black outs where I am in an uncontrollable rage I remember my parents holding me down at to check for track marks on my arms I must have been pretty psychotic for them to accuse me of being a junkie Teen angst I assumed but years on my episodes have only gotten worse This is already a stupidly long story I don t even tell this to my shrink so I ll summarise the rest quickly my family moved several hours away when I was in my second last year of school I hated my new school I felt so stupid and lost and uncomfortable I got pregnant had a secret abortion and never forgave myself I moved back and lived in a granny flat with one of my sisters Finished school but things just went ever the same I d discovered drugs Pills and speed My school friends didn t understand I moved back to the city near my parents The guy I got pregnant to had hung around and I was living with him until I realised I had only stayed with him because I was a mess after the baby thing he got abusive when I left him not wanting my parents to judge me or seem weak I kept living with my ex filing in my weekends with raves and a rebound guy One thing that did impact my life at this point was ghb considered a dirty scum drug I had a big crazy image to build to ensure I was popular in this new scene it was easy I had nothing to live for I hated myself for what I d done and the more I partied the less I had to stop and deal with the consequences I ended up in an ambulance times in weeks I passed out and woke up in some random guys bed with him fucking me I ran away and went back to the club I met a guy that loved going out too but knew I needed help so he wouldn t let me out of the house no matter how much I kicked and screamed We went out for a year but we were bad for each other we substituted ghb with speed and were still taking ghb when we could I spent destructive months after he left me in pieces My friends saw the tantrums one night male friends tried to stop me from hurting myself but I am stupidly strong in these rages and I managed to smash my head into the concrete several times until they let me go and then I ran and ran and don t remember the rest Ghb was ruining me again I met a guy from the rave scene I didn t think I was ready to leave my ex in the past but I decided to give it a chance So glad I did best thing that ever happened to me We moved in together after only a few weeks and years on were engaged I don t want to disclose the finger details in this time but I will say that whilst I m a better person we still give in to temptations just as often and I still have anger issues but until recently I hadn t wanted to hurt myself like I do right now My sister died a short time ago Overdose But on opiates It s not real to me it confuses me I can t make sense of it I don t want to deal with it I was diagnosed with ADHD anxiety disorders including mild OCD about a year ago Since my sister died my OCD is my way of coping things that used to be funny but necessary to me now physically hurt if I don t do them or if I do them wrong I can t help but think that my childhood desire to have people feel sorry for me paved the way to becoming that person Sometimes I wonder if it s just all in my head if I don t completely believe that I m sick how will I ever help myself When I get angry I often black out my partner tells me what happened each time I ve tried to jump out of his car at high speeds on a freeway drank bleach tried to grab a gun off a police officer hit my head so many times it s not funny taken pills blah blah right now it all seems like a good idea I feel so selfish It makes me feel worse,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood

What the hell do I do Hello This has taken me time I gather that this is not a very well read subreddit but I don t where else to post I am on the brink I do not want to be here any more however I do not deserve to be depressed I should be happy with my life but I want to die This makes me feel worse Here comes by story All my life I have been one of those mildly popular guys Never have I belonged to the elite of those popular but neither have I ever had to feel a lack of friends and neither have I have had to search for friend In short having friends have always been a given for me and I have even had friends who expressed jealousy because I had it all I had smarts I always had top grades in school yet I had friends among the cool kids and I always had girls However about half a year ago I started feel like shit I went on a trip with my then girlfriend We went to Cuba for vacation which we could afford because she worked in the travel industry and we could get very cheep tickets On the way there on then very flight I started to feel extremely nauseous bordering on unbearable nausea but we were only some minutes from landing so I pulled through When we arrived I didn t feel better and my nausea kept on albeit at a diminishing rate After a few days I felt fine Back home Sweden I felt almost fine but I would start having these bouts of nausea while at work These would sometimes result in me having to go home from work After a while with this I saw no other option than to go to a doctor This doctor told me that what I expressed seemed like nothing but stress I accepted this diagnosis as I at the time was very stressed out as I had my master s thesis and my work at the same time so I decided to wait things out Eventually my master thesis was finished and I passed and I had only my work to deal with But my nausea never ended At one time me and my then girlfriend went to the south of Sweden to go to a party This would normally entail two hours of train but because of whatever fuckup the train was cancelled and we had to go by bus I took extremely ill during the busride At the time I thought it was common motion sickness but I have never in my life previously been motion sick and I grew up on boats and on cars I shouldn t suffer from motion sickness Nevertheless I ascribed my sickness to motion sickness but I fell ill for more than two weeks Luckily we caught a ride with a car back to our home town which was horrible but better than a bus ride but back home I didn t get better so I finally started to think my ailment was psychosomatic After this I would frequently have bouts of what I can only describe as anxiety My doctor prescribed hydroxine to me which helped momentarily and I am on it now as I write and I feel fine My relationship with my girlfriend finally ended as she went on a semester abroad I felt nothing but relief as I could finally focus on my self I no longer had her to think of I contend that the failure of our relationship was due to my constant depression and not to her leaving I was supposed to go with her but just couldn t Here s the bad part As single I ve been extremely successful I ve constantly have had girls I ve slept around and I have even had offers for long term relationships Yet I have never been happy I have been extremely unhappy I am extremely unhappy I write this from a throwaway but any one of my friends who happen upon this post can easily identify from my circumstances My point is I am extremely unhappy I return home from having been offered to sleep with a girl yet still I did not want to i seriously do not believe it to be related to my former relationship I simply do not want to live any more I am severely depressed I suffer from random bouts of nausea and anxiety which I personally subscribe wholly to something psychosomatic Still I am very much aware of the fact that I do not deserve to be unhappy I have everything going for me I have a great education and girls throw themselves at my feet yet whatever happens I want to die I return tonight from a night on the town that resulted in at least two offers of coitus but I want to die I always want to die I usually am not suicidal I have no wish to end my own life I just wish to die But tonight something was different I think it was because I met an old crush of mine and my failure to ever get with her got to me but never the less tonight was the first time I ever wanted to end my life I am fully aware that the above text does nothing but convince people that I should not even be depressed But that is my problem I am so fucking depressed and the fact that I know I shouldn t be just makes things worse I hate myself for being depressed and I think I should just man up and so thinks everyone I ve told about my troubles But it doesn t work I am so fucking depressed and for the first time ever I want to end it all I just cried and I don t know why I want to die I just want to die so badly but I don t how to do it painlessly TL DR I have no reason to want so but I hate myself and I want to die Please r SuicideWatch Why do I feel like I do Why do cry at the thought of stepping onto a plane why do I want to end it all Why do I want to kill my self just now and how can I end it all I just want to feel better I speak to you rather than just going to a bridge because I realise I do not deserve to be unhappy but I am Please help me,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical

what can I do to help my friend my friend has been struggling with suicidal thoughts for years and has tried to kill himself at least twice that he s told me of he has a lot of financial stress his family took him to an inpatient care thing once and the hospital kept him there for days and charged him him a huge bill that he can t pay and his family won t help him besides this he has just had a really really terrible hard life and struggles with mental illness as well I feel so bad for him but whenever he vents to me I don t know what to say I want to make sure I am being as supportive as possible I know there s probably nothing I can do to help but I don t want to do anything wrong or not good enough i m just really scared for him His mom has to get an abortion recently and today he told me he feels jealous of it because he wasn t aborted Things he says to me are terrifying He is such a wonderful caring talented person with so much ambition and he has so much good to offer the world mostly i just let him vent at me when he s upset but all I can ever think of to say is yes that is really horrible I m so so sorry you feel that way and i hope things get better I wish I could help you I feel like this is such a stupid and generic thing to say but I don t know what else to do I am not good at speaking and i don t have a lot of life experience so it s hard for me to talk to him and relate to him sometimes but i just want to make sure I am not doing anything wrong I try to reassure him sometimes that when he gets insurance from his work soon and can see a therapist things will get better but I really don t know he has the means to kill himself whenever he wants he takes medication that requires needles so he has those around it s scary,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Is this actually DBT or is this just bad therapy for depression My therapist s response to I wish I could die without affecting anyone else was Well that s impossible Of course people who love you would miss you I would miss you It would be devastating That seems little short of guilt tripping I won t say it s totally ineffective but I kind of expected more from a DBT intensive therapist Or does DBT assume that the greatest motivation is positive attention Because it totally leverages the therapuetic relationship like it means more to me than anything else in the world Like Sorry you re ok and all but you re just my therapist I don t even know you Self harm has been officially unamed unacceptable and is punnishable by hours of no contact no phone coaching Phone coaching the thing they re supposed to try to get you to use instead of trying again to kill yourself If somebody s so desperate they re self harming possibly with intent to kill You can totally fix it by leveraging the need for continued attention against the need to feel better at any cost For the love of god why is there the assumption someone really just wants attention more than anything and if they get it for being good presenting as asymptomatic and not for being bad symptomatic they ll stop self harming or attempting suicide being symptomatic You cannot just manipulate me out of being suicidal That s not how this works I came to DBT for a robust empirically proven form of therapy that is supposedly heavy duty or industrial strength or whatever Supposedly perfect for severely depressed chronically suicidal people That s what I came for but I m not sure what it is that I m getting It assumes people are illogical attention motivated children above all else While I m not some mastermind genius I find that pretty insulting What do I get a gold star for each day without self harm too I know Let s go full out in behaviorism and do a token economy s I m studying psychology and neuroscience and this shit does not jive with what I ve been taught to expect of DBT I m disappointed really Flat out salty That and it s full of jargon that I can hardly begin to parse out My therapist says I need to work on my Committment to Living like it s a proper noun or something Oh and Mindfulness as a cure to everything including all misery of existence I don t like mindfulness I actually kind of hate it and the deep breathing bullshit too It doesn t work I don t like this toolkit I don t like this therapy and I hate this life Treatment resistant depressive Nothing works Not even a little,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I just set everything up for my second attempt and took everything downHi I previously tried back in November by jumping stories and surviving because I fell on a tree but I have brain damage thus I have a lot of trouble using the left side of my body I have some trouble walking and I can lift my left arm to my right shoulder but no more The doctors say I will have permanent damage in my left arm and I may never drink again because of becoming an alcoholic since my brain doesn t have as much control over alcohol as it did before I know I m lucky and the damage could be much worse but I still feel like I fucked myself over for life My girlfriend has been very supportive and has been through it all with me She clearly loves me which I appreciate very much But the real question is how much can she take If she decides that she can t handle this anymore and ends our relationship I really think I ll attempt suicide again and succeed this time Because of this fear I set up my note in the kitchen on my phone with myself beside the stove to emit carbon monoxide indefinitely with no pilot light But I couldn t go through with it for some reason Maybe because of my antidepressants Anyways I just wanted to let everybody know my story and I m still here,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Progress Update"

Difficult thoughtsSo I m in one of my crisis and just came across here while trying to find something to get my mind off of everything So I guess I ll just post away and hopes it helps a bit So I had a friend She commited suicide in and I got to know only in I was in my last year of high school when I discovered and I had a fight with her Stupid reasons really Mostly not agreeing on stuff that really wasn t important When I tried to talk to her again to apologize or something I got the news It was heartbreaking and I wish I could have done something anything I mean we were both pretty alone at life really And just like that a person that was one of my only friends was gone just like that Nothing I could feel other than the pain it left that I could never talk to her again That all I have now is fucking memories So you d think due to my experience that I d learn something I don t know But even all those years later I just did not forgive myself I m not particularly alone and I KNOW there are people that care That they are with me and all that Still even when people say that I m worth it or whatever I can t seem to believe it All that comes through my mind is how much I fucked everything up for basically nothing and how nothing I could ever do would revert that It s so stupid but yet every once in a while it becomes so heavy and I just don t know what to do I think that I m not worth it That it d be better if everything came to a stop But yet I do believe in the words of the few people that say they care no matter how hollow they seem when I think about it Basically yeah I don t know Honestly I just feel like utter shit and usually I tank this shit alone as I ve always did And I see where it takes me I just wait and see like the stupid coward I am Anyway I m sorry about this I m not sure it all made sense but this is how I m feeling this is how I usually feel when late night comes around and I can t just so something to make it go away Anyway I m sorry if this bothered anyone I just needed to let this out in a different place in a place where I don t have the certainty people will just say that I should let it go already,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Long story please read and comment I have been feeling extremely suicidal as of late to a degree where I now dream of all the possible ways to end it I typically dream of my old apartment building and jumping off of the pool deck on the top floor I have lost a lot of things in my life and I have struggled with a lot and I just don t have the strength anymore Back story follows I was born into a loving family a terrific father a loving mother and my older siblings and twin brother Well my father found out that my mother was an alcoholic who would drink incessantly and it didn t get this way until my older brother s drug problem started getting worse Well after my father begged my mother to stop time and time again he decided he had enough and when I was my dad left my mum turning her occasional drinking into incessant drinking My twin and I had to live with my alcoholic mother and did all of our lives and the drinking never stopped years after my father leaves my older brother dies of a drug overdose and this makes the already bad drinking into a horrible habit starting as early as or in the morning and being smashed by I didn t know that my mum was the way she was until about th grade I entered middle school a fat loser because I had no friends from trying to care for my mum who always told me she was sick Well I entered and was made fun of all the time for my ears which were a bit large for my head at the time I have since grown into them I was bullied at school and came home to be bullied by my mother and if I was lucky I would have dinner typically I only had breakfast because we had no money for lunch and I could have some bread for breakfast As the years passed the drinking became worse and in th and th grade I attempted suicide a few times not really sure how to actually end it Each attempt failed obviously and each time it angered my mum but we never got me help from the quack I was never diagnosed with depression which I knew I was depressed and we never did anything about my urge to kill myself In my sophomore year I met a girl I thought I loved The relationship was great at first sex all the time and worries later I had never been in a real relationship so I thought this was how it worked We had sex all day every day She was a year older than me so when she left for college things became a bit rocky and I wasn t stable enough to deal with it at the time Shit went downhill and we broke up a few times and eventually went on a break around Halloween time in It was on this break that I met the girl of my dreams It was at my friends birthday party whose birthday rests on Halloween We met up and I was absolutely blown away by how unbelievably beautiful she was We began talking and we had interests in the same bands the same way of thinking the same type of humor We had a blast that night and we flirted cuddled and ALMOST kissed but I realized that would probably be in poor taste Y see my ex the one who said we should take a break never actually broke up with me she only said we should be distant for a bit not that we are broken up so I felt really guilty about everything I had done with this amazing girl who we will call Jill I couldn t confess to Jill what I was thinking I was too scared and pathetic to do so so I broke ties with her Well I found out my ex was fucking a lot of other guys AFTER telling her about Jill and her being pissed at me for even having had feelings for other girls Eventually the bitch ex and I break up and within two weeks Jill and I start dating Jill blew my mind every single day with how fantastic she was she was funny witty extremely smart and exceptionally beautiful I woke up every day and realized I have something worth living for now We were happy all the time and within a month I told her I love her and she said she loves me too that I am the most amazing person she has ever met in her life I was head over heels for her every day was fantastic because she existed in my life and every day was great despite all my other problems because in my life problems don t escape me Well about a month ago she dumped me because she didn t want to be tied down for the time and the shitty thing was I was going to propose in a few short months to be exact I know it is corny but I was going to surprise her at her college and find her in class or wherever and just kneel down and straight up propose to the girl of my dreams my soulmate if you will Well after she left I realized how bad my problems really are and how much worse things are getting now that I have put them on the backburner My debt for school is mounting ever higher and I don t know how to take care of it My college fund has been drained almost entirely and I failed two of my courses this past quarter because Jill dumped me and because I was terribly sick for a month Well I have to wait another months to take them again and I don t know what to do My mother is kicking me out because of my bitter mood even though I don t say a thing to her she also let me know that I am a loser who has done nothing with his life and fucked up the only job I had My Dad is breaking his back to help pay for school and because of my commute and the hours the schools have I can t get a job no one in my area will take on someone who can t even guarantee weekends I am not into drinking or doing drugs because of everything that has happened in my life and because my family obviously has a problem with addictions aunt is a drug addict grandma was too another aunt was also a drug addict My problem is this I have spent so much of my life in denial that now all the deck is stacked against me I have go to a school that I hate doing a major I despise and the college won t let me transfer about of my credits and I have no money to start fresh somewhere else My mother has slipped back into her old demonishing state where she lets me know everyday what I am doing wrong and won t let me stand up for myself My ex Jill is extremely happy now that we are broken up guys are constantly flirting with her on her page on facebook and constantly trying to hang out with her and none of my friends even give enough of a damn to call or ask me to hang out I have been strong my whole life dealing with my mother and having to take care of her and sacrificing my own personal life to make sure she doesn t fall down the stairs in a drunken stupor and get herself killed I was strong when my twin got into a car accident that almost killed him and I was strong when my twin decided to start drinking like my mum does My mum is clean now but she still abuses the fuck out of me and I can t be strong anymore Jill tells me she loves me that she wants to get back together someday because she sees me as her soulmate but I don t think I can just get better and not be sad about what she did to me I don t know what to do anymore I don t even remember what else I should put on here because there were so many problems in my life Please I need some advice I dream about killing myself every single night and all day every day I can t help but imagine how much better life would be without me being alive I daydream about my Jill being happy with everyone else and not caring about me anymore I don t get any support from my friends my dad tells me that I can t dwell on things and my brother would never understand The only person who does understand is my female friend who lives in Canada I am literally on the edge right now and I am so close to just ending it all and calling it quits Please I need some advice TL DR My life sucks my mother was an abusive alcoholic who wouldn t feed me for days at a time my father was never there because my mother wouldn t let him my brother took up drinking one of my older brothers died of a drug overdose I have no aspirations and no plan for a future and the only future I saw myself having walked out on me because she didn t want to be tied down right now I am on the verge of killing myself and need some advice otherwise I will just go through with it,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood

 I'm tired of having ugly ass arms because I was raped and sexually assaulted multiple times and didn't know how else to handle it other than by taking a blade to my arms every night hoping that maybe I went deep enough this time.
 
 I'm doing things without even knowing that I'm fucking doing them.
 
 I'm tired of zoning out without even realizing it like during a hair cut and only snapping out of it when I slice my inner knuckle with my shears.
 
 I'm just tired. I'm fucking tired. I'm ready to be better. I'm ready to stop feeling like shit every fucking day of my life and to stop being trapped inside my head.
 
 I'm tired of my fiance being the only reason I even want to stay alive. I want to be alive because life is good, but I can't enjoy it and I can't find any other reason to be here other than him.
 
 Lol, and now I'm holding back tears because typing all this hurts so much and he's sitting right across the room and he's dealt with me crying enough this week so I guess it's time to finish up my drink and light another cigarette and hope that maybe I won't feel like shit tomorrow.","Mood Tracking, Seeking Help, Progress Update",Cause of Distress

Today was badI really don t want to get into it There have been a few close calls I ve held a gun to my head and a rope around my neck but i ve always failed to follow through My coworker and I did everything right today But we still get reamed out by the boss I don t know why i m so angry I thought I would be able to calm myself like I always do after a rough day at work But today just keep getting angrier as the day goes on I m enraged but i don t know why I know I m not going to kill myself I know i m not I feel like a fraud posting here like There are other people that need to vent I don t even know if i m going to hit the post button Other people that need to be talked down from the ledge I joke a lot about how I might kill myself Nobody ever takes me seriously I make sure of that I do know that joking about suicide can be a sign that someone needs help I can t afford professional help though I always ask people that joke about suicide if they need to talk Nobody has ever taken me up on my offer but I do hope that they would come to me if they needed to My biggest fear is that some day I might kill myself on accident When I have that gun to my head I may be so enraged that I just pull the trigger and then nothing I don t want my parents to find me I really don t want to die I don t And I think I have my emotions under enough control to not do anything stupid I thought at least I am not going to kill myself I just need some room to breathe I think I just can t stop crying,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I keep trying and nothing changes Warning Long Post I m going to describe my situation I m and will be this March I did a year of college and withdrew because I realized if I went to a city or state funded school it would be far cheaper and just as good an education than the college I was at But at the same time I realized I wanted to move out of New York Either way over in interest accruing debt from that measly two semesters of college I urgently needed a job of course to pay rent in the mean time I lived in Brooklyn for a year in two awful living situations with crazy roommates I couldn t move back home because my brother has severe violent anger issues and has used racial slurs including the n word in the past and my mother is a horrible alcoholic That was years ago in Since then I have gone through more applications trial runs and interviews than I can count With no degree and no specific skill or experience I have applied to mostly stores and some restaurants in that time I ended up moving back home with my mother and now she pays rent for my brother s apartment in a town over Not because of me because she kicked him out The longest job I had was as a cashier at a Stop amp Shop for months I worked full time hours most weeks more than hours a week but they thinly skirted the system so as not to give me healthcare I ended up quitting because they gave me hell about using the bathroom Seriously the people who were supposed to cover me would refuse to let me use the bathroom and would call me on the loudspeaker when I had only been in there a couple minutes It got so bad that I could never relax enough to pee Damnably I still have the problem to this day I ve tried everything I quit the job in April almost a year ago and well before that the urination problem started Frequent urination I m positive it s from the job I have never struggled with this before in my life It doesn t feel right anymore if I am exercising I have to go at least every minutes so I don t exercise anymore The doctor told me it s psychological and told me to see a therapist More on that later I was denied unemployed benefits blamed by them Can t get food stamps because I don t meet eligibility since I don t pay or more of of my expenses Yes my mom and her father pay rent but she does not give me any money She used to and then stopped entirely I can only survive with the food pantry in my town Since then I ve applied to so many jobs I ve lost the people I used to talk to because they started blaming me saying I wasn t doing enough and it was my fault too No friends I m a virgin which I don t care about I don t compare myself to people and I hate the predominant culture that assigns value to such things anyway always have I m so poor that dating and relationships are impossibly distant anyway I don t talk to my mother anymore at all She is an alcoholic that neglected and abused me and my brother our entire lives and feels zero remorse and blames and vilifies me for every little thing every chance she gets Her father physically assaulted my brother and flat out told me the one time I tried to reach out to him that he doesn t want to see me or ever deal with my problems Needless to say he drinks and verbally abusive to his wife too He took my mother s side when I left home at one point because of how bad my mother was house hopping with friends I no longer have before I went to college My mother is a compulsive hoarder and the entire apartment is a mess so I ve never had guests over and it s hard to cook food I m vegetarian so all I eat is oats cereal spaghetti and occasionally frozen vegetables But even that is hard because the kitchen is such a mess and if I tried to clean it she would scream at me for throwing something away or make it messy again and blame the mess on me My father is out of the picture the last time he emailed me he blamed me for leaving college and doing nothing He has a new wife and daughter and lives in Japan Needless to say I don t think he deserves to know how hard I ve been trying against the grain of everything I don t drink smoke or do any drugs of any kind Never have never will Never had the slightest interest in it This makes me even more isolated almost everybody at least in New York City does I d rather be alone than be friends with any of them no question The only way I could theoretically have a life again is if I find a job save up earn money to move out I knew it would be hard but I don t mind working at least hours a week standing all day focusing on the job waking up early and coming home every day when it s dark I m used to it I have a great work ethic and am polite to everyone Just recently I lost two jobs at a pharmacy and waffle shop in my town Why They just Didn t Like me They refused to give me an explanation I kept myself busy the entire time took notes was diligent and polite to everyone And nothing Just now my mother threatened to evict me Unlike my brother who was drinking and fighting with her I keep to myself She threatened to kick me out because the neighbors in the apartment make up lies about noise I know the noise is not coming from me because I am always quiet but she believes them Wants me gone Has talked about air bnb ing my room She never loved or wanted me and only sees me as a problem and a burden and would prefer me dead More money and space for her I try not to think about how horrible she is because the opposite of love isn t hate it s indifference I need to just focus on my own life finding a job to be my own independent person and focus on things that matter to me As I told her before she is not my mother So I feel nothing but once in a while in push come to shove situations like this I have a nervous breakdown So one time the police came because a neighbor called them because I couldn t stop screaming and crying But that had nothing to do with the noise complaints this was recently and after them I m positive I don t want kids I got a vasectomy from Planned Parenthood They gave me weird energy and so did the doctor I saw later about the urination Your average person thinks you ll regret it or you just got it because of the way YOUR parents were In reality I am not bringing a son or daughter into this world that has to deal with the problems of this world They would have to deal with all of the political social and climate resource related problems in the world They wold have to deal with heartbreak loss work suffering have the possibility of an accident or unbelievable agony from illness know they will die And at the end of course die I can t look into the eyes of my beloved child knowing they will die I don t not believe in God or the afterlife I KNOW that God or the afterlife doesn t exist Biologically people are dead and dead for good There are enough people that know they are alive and know they will die Theoretically I could be just as happy without kids and a family I have no idea how with all of this but I volunteer every Friday in Brooklyn taking a commute that is over hours both ways It s not really surprising it s my only connection to the outside world because I have no friends here in the suburb I grew up in and am stuck living in now I m not close friends with any of the people there though and it s led to nothing I never tell them about all of this and occasionally if someone asks how I am and I say anything less than great they would think I don t appreciate what I have since I don t pay rent Some of them like me but it s nothing if I can t get a job to move on with my life which I can t Every day is unbearable Theoretically I am a like able person but none of it in practice matters After all is said and done the final question is why do I not see a therapist Why not talk about this to them instead of this website One word medication I had a bad experience with one that I had since middle school who got so fascist about it he would refuse to talk to me unless I took it Which I did one mg pill of Prozac In case you didn t know that s the smallest possible dose of a mild antidepressant that takes weeks to kick in or taper down from You can laugh at this I took one pill and my balls started to hurt My body literally rebelled against it That was how much I was badgered into doing something I didn t want to do He wasn t a psychiatrist but he was connected to the one I saw who prescribed the Prozac So I quit both of them This was soon after I left college in I know most psychologists therapists would be the same way Blame me Something is wrong with me I don t know a lot but I know they are wrong I know how intelligent polite self motivated I am Every problem I have ever had has been reacting to external circumstance and with that a lot of patience and fortitude If I had money everything could be different I would have time space a place of my own and would live alone I would still work but using my gifts for the world Or even a drudgery job I wouldn t care But as it is my life has been my mother and brother their constant threats and abuse stuck in it with every effort to proceed with my life rebuffed and actively painful thrown back in my face When I lived in an apartment I could only afford one with roommates who were also psychotic My own ticket to salvation a job I have been trying to find one and failing for years with countless problems and crazy people at them I have been so patient with but even there I leak out the side sometimes They would say I have anxiety emotional problems ADHD trouble focusing and need medication And that if I don t take it I m immature blaming other people instead of taking responsibility I could not possibly be more mature or responsible If I wasn t these things this entire post would be hate for my parents for not giving me money But what is it It s focusing on the fact that I can t get jobs or even at least unemployment benefits so I can eat and survive while I look for one But I accept that because I can t change it and even then focus on getting jobs And I know that medication is not the answer At the end of the day I am finding myself lacking the willpower I still try to apply to jobs but every day strangles me more than the last The very motivation is stifled because everything of my body and mind has learned that all of my efforts boomerang back in my face It s so hard to try when the job people yell at me and blame me and think false things of me no different than my mother It s terrible that it has come to this but more and more lately I think how suicide would be a sweet escape No more pain or suffering This can t be denied The only reason not to do it is that there s a possibility of things getting better and being happy in the future I know I can never be happy living with my mom that s for sure So I ve held on all this time on the possibility that I might get a job and move out I see a lot of posts here saying things like Everyone says it will get better and It won t get better Slowly I am waking up to the fact that these things are no less true for me Of course part me wants to live But as I realize further and further the impossibility of getting that chance at least not having to suffer anymore slowly becomes more and more enticing The one post I won t tolerate is saying go to college in New York now I hate New York and everything about it and am positive I want to move Do not say there is no heaven or wherever you go there you are or anything of the sort I am not in the slightest idealistic and I know everywhere has problems no less than I know that the only possibility of me being happy is moving If it took more than years to save up enough to move while living here I would accept that if I knew that once I moved out I would never have to live with my mom again but at the same time I would rather die than live here for another years in this condition while also being busy in college and having zero to show for it except less money and more debt This goes for years community college also Or living in the city which I also hate and I know there are no perfect cities no less than I know there are cities substantially different than New York City And I am never living in a dorm situation again From experience at two different colleges I know it s a nightmare with zero independence or privacy I want to get a job save up move to a city and go to a city funded college in the city whilst having a job to support myself I m positive I want to go to The West Coast or Europe I am realizing that it may be impossible and so the only other possibility is death You could say I could move to a place with a job with the degree but then I should be able to move with a job without that This world is evil There is a caste system that kills young people that have no skills by only letting them have kitchen or customer service jobs kicking them out of that blaming them denying their survival unemployment food stamps housing while they look for a job and the only way out is to take out a loan and being in debt for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars This is the most evil plutocratic thing ever The world is truly by and for the rich My friend who I no longer really talk to since he blames me for not having a job has EU citizenship through his mother and lives in France as a full citizen He is the luckiest person I know My mother was born in the USA but my father in Iran I sometimes think of getting Iranian citizenship since I wouldn t have to pay for college small potatoes compared to the work of learning Farsi Recently a thought has come to mind that describes my life I am asking for nothing and I can t even have that If I was asking for a house a car a job that paid enough to support a wife pets and two kids it would be different but I m not asking for any of that I just want to live alone have at least some time to pursue things like art that matter to me even if that always has to be on a shoestring budget and any mediocre job that is at least manageable if not difficult This has not been difficult it has been an impossible ideal No wonder I am depressed An unemployed no degree half Iranian year old NEET teetotalism virgin living in the USA the most murderous war machine in the world run by Donald Trump with a psychotic Nazi for a brother an absent father who thinks I m a loser and an alcoholic verbally abusive insane mother with zero friends an empty wallet and bank account rejected from every job every type of job every place over years because I am told I am incompetent anxious loser when in reality I am as hard working as they come I ll always know that the problem wasn t my negative thinking Everyone says change to more positive thoughts first if you want your life to change Nothing could inaccurately reflect my situation more than this I have had so much hope in all of my efforts for something to change or happen through those very efforts itself mind you not just waiting for things to change I ve gotten it out and even for this board it s a very long post No offence to anyone here but I see a lot of posts with a lot of missing capitalization punctuation grammar and spelling mistakes My grammar is anything but perfect or ideal but relatively speaking my writing is pretty polished if not only superficially as opposed to structurally I don t take pride in this but I hope if nothing else the effort to clearly articulate everything thus far shows If you ve gotten this far you must have a thing for reading the thoughts of depressed strangers on the internet Even if not one person reads it I at least typed all of it up And even if someone does at most they can just reply just cold words on the computer screen that might as well be my own In spite of everything I just said you can say whatever you want I would rather have people s sincere thoughts and feelings not be stifled from coming out After all nothing in the planet makes me angrier than the fact that the job people can t even tell me why they fire me A gun is put to my head and my last wish is to know why I have to die and they laugh as they pull the trigger It is one trillion times more damning and insulting that they hold back on account of my feelings or because they can t be bothered to tell me why they do not hire me than the fact that they reject me to begin with I ve never had a problem of cyber bullying because it s just words on the screen Say every awful thing if it s what you really honestly feel about me I ll appreciate the honesty even I assume people are reasonably nice here but the logic still applies At the end of the day I want what everyone wants to be happy But I ve given up on that I have tried for years which is one fifth of my lifespan If I cannot be happy at least I can not be unhappy For now I will keep trying on an empty tank of gas every day more emotionally stifling and painful than the last But like everything there is a limited capacity to this And unless suddenly my luck changes the capacity will eventually be reached And I do not believe in luck I only use it metaphorically as metaphorical as it would be to mention my situation improving Until then no thoughts well wishes feelings or prayers can help me Only tangible improvement which I know damn well can only be brought about by my own efforts which the blamers that is to say everyone I make the mistake of mentioning all of this to love to tell me more than anything I am making those efforts You know the results Medical problems more rejection violence more pain The tangible improvement will either come first or death by my own hands which I have had unfathomable patience already in holding off from But sooner or later the logic of it will become clear I don t want to die anymore than my biology wants to survive What will happen will happen but either way I dread the pain of the future,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping,

It just seems like the right idea at the moment Hi reddit I ve lurked a while and things in my life have lately come to a fever pitch I feel trapped by everything and I don t feel like I live in a world where I m truly free anymore My relationships are burning me alive and even my friendships feel porous and deceitful I could use the kind words cause I know there are no answers I included my poetry I don t know why I guess to seem like an individual worth encouraging I can t escape the overriding feeling that everything in my life is rotting Thanks for your time I m a well traveled man with a stride and a plan to wander less near from so far But nothing I will see or ever have seen beats back the Big Bang in my yard See Williker Tidds who lived with his kids was a bootlegger hot off the south and when prohibition brought in inhibition Ol Williker whistled his mouth and said Jesus H Christ boy these people these people All looking for just a load off Now run back and forth and stay drunk on the sly While the cops they retreat from the law And though the money all goes up the expenses hose What if one could handle the weight Could one make such a still that its liquor would fill Every Sub Mason Dixon Line State Well Jehosephat Joe I know just where to go there s a rock that fell out of the sky And its shiny and hard and not an inch of its charred even though ten foot round the brush died And the sound it creates when you hit it or knock it is softer than you think it would And the air doesn t smell like there s burning in fact the scent surrounding s quite good But its steel like and feels like a distant vibration a rail for a train yet to come And its cold as a spring even though the damn thing is just cookin right there in the sun So he brought in a team and they all got the rock to sit stark on the back of his trailer And he hammered and blacksmithed and worked on great sheets of the asteroid thinner and paler And with tireless zeal and a few hurried meals Tidds fashioned a splendid machine And he stuffed it with grains and he churned up a batch that he knew would be sweet strong and clean But when the day came to cash in on his game Williker gasped cause he wasn t sure If inside of the still floating round in the mash was a light so bright and so pure that a glance would set ones imagination on fire and the soul too would in rapture burn For the colors contained in that shimmer or glimmer would take a gods mind just to learn And he swallowed and watched with a glow on his face and a helpless look right in his eyes He said Mercy what what is that and then went inside and turned off the light But at night he rest stubbornly and the thoughts in his head Ran around in insomniac roar And when he sat on the edge of the foot of his bed The light glowed outside of his door With a start he stood up and ran right to his still which emitted a casual hum and the light that shot out from the top of the tank lit the night like a placebo sun And his shout was so loud that was wife the old cow woke and waddled outside just to yell But the second she saw what dropped Willikers jaw then so too Etnas jaw promptly fell For the tank had been melting for quite a long time and the whiskey had boiled away And the brand new universe just sat there shining at the end of its very first day Theres a lot going on in universe spawn some things that you really can t know Like the sound planets make when theyre bumping and thumping as the galaxies they re inside grow And the trillion quarks making zillions of sparks as they bristle and crystal collide And the nebulas blooming and supernovas booming for young stars are too doomed to die And just hanging in air over two wide eyed stares the universe gained dimension and size And its growth was quite slow But quite steady and so in a year the Tidds moved lest they died For their house had been burned by a baby red giant like a superball coated with lava And their vase was erased by tiny black hole and some meteors got on the guavas And the living conditions grew dimmer and dimmer in the town where Williker lived And as land was devoured while men scattered and cowered People knew that something had to give For insurance adjusters had no clue what to write when the house was clearly just gone and replaced by universe golden and glowing and taking more insured houses on Then the government came with their titles and names and declared the small town a lost cause And in haste the whole state had to evacuate said the brand new ex states new state laws And for year after year the grand spectacle grew Until Tennessee was just an orb That hung twinkling high like a jewel in the sky Looking for a new state to absorb And slowly we retreat with the back of our feet hot from The Fires of Wondrous Creation But we all kinda wish that the need for the booze hadn t set up our own immolation For the commune we live in at the edge of the world while it numbers a

"Hi all! I've been on this sub before, but I left a while back because of the whole, y'know, denial thing that anything is actually wrong and putting blinders on. You know how it is.
 
 I've been a total piece of crap to my husband, who has been my biggest champion for YEARS. I've allowed myself to be a total slave to my illness and basically refused to do anything to better myself. I didn't feel that I needed it, but holy shit I do. On top of that, I've discovered that while not diagnosed, I do actually fit the NPD criteria. Not fun in. The. SLIGHTEST. But it really explains a LOT and knowing about narcissistic rage answers a lot of questions, which helps.
 
 I've lost all of my friends and family and while my husband still loves me and cares for me, he is so hurt by everything I've put him through. I am at a crossroads in my life: I either keep putting fingers in my ears and insisting that I don't need to change, and thus getting divorced and being completely alone, *or*, I can make the damn changes, make amends, and have the family, friends, and husband I love, want, and need.
 
 It's time to make my indecisive ass choose something for once.
 
 For those of you who have successes and have been able to make amends in damaged relationships, and have made changes in yourself; what are some ways I can be better about my illness and more aware of the effect I have without hiding from it? How can I be a better person for the people who love me dearly, but are very tired and hurt?

Running out of options and ideasI m just going to warn now that this is going to be a bit long I m really really sorry I m I lost my mom on Thanksgiving Nov of She had terminal cancer and the entire process of her getting extremely ill and dying traumatized me pretty badly She died when I was on the way to the hospice to see her so I didn t get to say goodbye Between that and a lot of other things I also carry a lot of guilt as well as trauma and grief revolving around her death Less than two months after she died we experienced a house fire and I lost my home and four pets I had This has caused me to reach a breaking point that s just been kind of ebb and flowing since mid January I have a lot of familiarity with suicidal ideation I ve been in and out of hospitals for suicidal thoughts attempts and self injury since I was Lost count of the amount of times I haven t been admitted since but I went a couple weeks ago for a screening Only a hospital that I have very bad experiences with had beds so I contracted to safety and signed out This was over fourth of July weekend so the lack of beds didn t surprise me I have borderline personality disorder pretty bad OCD and way before my mom passed I had already had PTSD from an abusive relationship rape in my early teens I can t hold down a job or go to school and I m on disability I was in DBT and getting a lot better before my mom got sick I ve also been off my meds since February I lost my medicaid because of a mistake social security made and getting it back has been really slow I go to individual therapy once a week and I like my therapist but I don t really trust him yet Living with my dad has been my worst nightmare since I was a little kid and because of me being so mentally ill I cannot afford to live on my own and am forced to live with him now we recently moved into an apartment He is extremely stubborn extremely volatile has always been pretty emotionally abusive and sometimes physically abusive and generally unwilling to deal with giving me the extra help I need because the chain of events since my mom s sickness and death has caused me to regress in terms of therapy progress He s not obligated to because I m an adult but I just feel so stuck He is also disabled and doesn t do anything all day and often if I so much as ask him a question I don t have a license and at my age most of my close friends work fulltime so I have few options to get away I have a caseworker but so far he s useless compared to my last one I can barely feed myself am having trouble with keeping on top of my hygiene and can hardly get out of bed just typical depression things Because of my lack of health insurance and medication I have been self medicating with cannabis but it doesn t even help anymore Despite this I can t stop because I m just too depressed to do anything else Besides my cat I have little else to keep going on except hope that my boyfriend will get here and we can get away from this sand I can get a fresh start We re a long distance relationship from different countries and various things have caused visa issues with him which adds even more stress and I just feel a sense of urgency because my entire life is just toxic right now Hopefully everything will be resolved soon and we can be together at least but I m running out of hope I m currently waiting to see if he ll skype with me About every other night I reach what feels like a breaking point like right now I have never been so miserable in my entire life I feel like if nothing changes soon I might attempt again Everything else that has driven me over the edge before seems petty compared to now I m basically just fighting with myself about whether or not I should just go back to the emergency room and just voluntarily sign myself inpatient and get it over with I m running out of options and I m even considering electroconvulsive therapy If my boyfriend can t find time to skype me tonight I may have to go to the ER soon as in within the next few hours but either way I will try to hold off until at least tomorrow I just don t know what to do anymore but I also don t know if the hospital can even help me at this point,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I wrote an abomination D Dr Blivious Brainwits was a man who liked tall women likely connected to his long standing slenderman fetish He sat alone at his booth staring across the club at his desired woman She too was sitting alone at another booth drinking a glass filled with some red liquid Blivious wondered what it was Perhaps I should ask her he thought It could serve as an excuse to introduce myself With that he gulped down the remainder of his beverage which was a strong mixture of whiskey and soy sauce It was an acquired taste but quite a good one for those capable of enjoying it He slid out of the booth and weaved his way clumsily through the crowd of club goers dancing to the emo trap bangers that the dj kept playing The track currently being played was pure fire a song called Helena Remix by My Chemical Romance and Metro Boomin featuring Savage The doctor soon found it difficult to tame his hips which had an incredible desire to begin swinging to the beat He pinched himself on the back of his left hand reminding himself of the task at hand the woman Nothing else mattered With newfound confidence he found himself able to resist dancing to the infectious club banger He walked over to the booth of the young woman and sat across from her May I ask madam what you are drinking He said smoothly speaking in a heavy British accent He flashed an awkward smile revealing his polished white teeth and unhealthy blood red gums The contrast was frightening He winked at her Take a sip she said as she pushed her glass towards Blivious He took it and had a short sip It tasted strongly of ketchup It was a local brew the Ketchbrau a ketchup infused beer The doctor raised one eyebrow and proceeded to gulp down the rest of the Ketchbrau in seconds Um sir The woman began That was my Yes yes Blivious waved his hand dismissively I shall buy you another madam he said with a strong Russian accent Tis will only take a moment m lady He stood up and went towards the bar As he walked he bulged his chest feeling prideful about the progress he had made with the woman All signs were looking good One Ketchbrau over here kind sir He cried at the bartender who nodded in response Actually he added Make it two Ketchbrau After receiving the drinks Blivious returned to the woman s booth He slid one drink towards her and she sipped it slowly as she eyed him suspiciously So she said I d appreciate it if you d introduce yourself She squinted at him Very well madam He said with a heavy French accent The woman frowned at the sudden accent change You are speaking to the widely acclaimed Dr Blivious Brainwits I have a Ph D He smiled Charmed yet madam He smiled even wider His gums appeared to stretch almost as if they may split in half It was frightening The woman frowned even harder making it appear as if she now had a unibrow So now that you know my credentials madam may I know yours He pulled a wooden pipe from his pocket and brought it to his lips He lit the pipe and began sucking down the fumes of the poison ivy he was smoking Not a single trace of smoke escaped from his lips He felt his lungs burning within his chest Seeing this the woman frowned further still her forehead becoming wrinkled and distorted from the effort Her forehead looked like that of an old woman I m uh call me Lindsey Lindsey Cocksworth She said still frowning Cocksworth Asked Blivious surprised Cocksworth sounds like a good sign he thought He smiled to himself Erm no I mean yes she blushed Blivious pulled his pipe from his mouth and put it to his nose inhaling the fumes It tickled the inside of his face Lindsey frowned even further her forehead contorting beyond what should have been humanly possible It was a horrible sight to behold Interesting surname madam May I ask of its origins He raised one eyebrow taking on a sensual and suggestive expression Well the woman suddenly stopped frowning and began smiling instead Want to find out doctor She winked Blivious suddenly felt something bulging in his underwear It was a sensation he hadn t felt in a long time Oh madam he gasped That is quite the suggestion I just may have to take you up on that offer He shifted in his booth leaning in closer to the woman Gladly Blivious sped down the street in his Lamborghini Corvette hybrid the Lamborvette It was a custom vehicle of his own design Lindsey sat in the passenger seat singing along to every emo trap banger that came on the radio She had been singing along to DaBaby s BOP Remix featuring Gerard Way and Travis Barker when they pulled into the doctor s driveway Blivious stepped out of his car and began walking towards the front door Lindsey close behind He slid the key in opening the door and turned to watch Lindsey as she walked towards him Despite the darkness of the night he thought he could see something protruding from between her legs Blivious blinked and rubbed his eyes thinking he was imagining things Lindsey walked into the house with the doctor who shut the door behind them The woman instantly pushed Blivious onto the couch asserting her dominance She let out a low inhuman growl Blivious was lying on his back looking up at the woman as she stripped her clothes off He smiled at her Until he saw her cock It was a massive juicy thick hunk of meat far beyond the length and girth of the average penis It was almost two feet long and several inches wide Blivious was about to stand up and run away but Lindey s growls intimated him and he dared not make a move As she growled he suddenly realized that her mouth was not moving He looked at her penis and realized the head of the penis had a mouth reminiscent of that of a dog Ma mad madam Blivious stuttered You you Silence She cried speaking from both her mouth and her penis at the same time The voice coming from her mouth was shrill and high while that of her cock was low and gritty They spoke in perfect unison I did not sign up for this madam He yelled using a heavy Nigerian accent GrrrrrrRAOW the penis said The woman looked down and began patting her penis as if it were a pet Shh she whispered to her cock Her cock grumbled in return Seeing her distracted the doctor made a run for it He rolled off the couch and quickly got to his feet sprinting to the door He had almost made it No No Madam you can t I can she said as she dragged him by his leg back towards the couch She let out a sinister cackle Nothing will stop me Blivious whimpered in despair as Lindsey tore his shirt off She began gripping and yanking on his pants struggling to pull them off as he squirmed desperately on the couch Her cock was now fully erect it s length almost five feet as it angled diagonally upwards Strangely enough however her balls were a normal size Lindsey had now ripped off Blivious s pants and underwear revealing his erect three inch dick She gripped her own penis and angled it down towards his The mouth of her penis licked it s lips preparing to give Blivious a penis to penis blowjob as tears streamed down his cheeks Her medium sized boobs began bouncing up and down by themselves as if they had a mind of their own Her nipples suddenly cracked and opened into two tiny mouths squealing excitedly Suddenly when he thought all hope had been lost Blivious had an idea He looked over towards his Amazon Echo device resting atop a table in the corner of the room Alexa He yelled Play an emo trap banger Lindsey s penis lips were only an inch away from his cock when his speakers began blasting music catching her off guard and startling her The song that began playing was WAP Remix by Cardi B and Jonathan Davis featuring Machine Gun Kelly Instantly Lindsey leapt back and away from Blivious She began uncontrollably bucking her hips front to back and side to side falling victim to the club banger Noooo She cried in protest as she began flailing and bouncing uncontrollably around the room in time with the music Ha You have been bested madam Said the doctor speaking in a thick Southern accent N not not possible Lindsey screamed Tis quite possible indeed madam He said as he stood up He put his clothes back on while the woman continued dancing uncontrollably Her penis was no longer erect and had gone back to being only three feet long and dangling He pulled his pipe from his pocket and began smoking The woman was now curled up in a ball in the corner of the room struggling to try and stop herself from dancing Blivious walked up to her and shoved his pipe up her penis mouth It howled in pain as it was lit on fire and began burning from the inside out By the time the song ended Lindsey was little more than a burnt up crusty corpse Blivious put his hands on his hips and smiled to himself Another job well

"I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless, I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sh*t","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress","Miscellaneous, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

The thought of the end is the only thing that makes me happy I m not entirely sure what to say I often find myself lost for words but now I need them more than ever I have been depressed for a while now and I have tried oh lord have I tried to get rid of it to make it disappear I no longer think I have the capability to be happy it seems almost impossible I m going to apologize in advance for the inevitable essay but this is my first post and I have a lot of things I need aired I need someone to hear me to listen to me before I explode First of all my mother died when I was she was and died suddenly Obviously there was a lot of heart ache sadness and so on the stuff you would normally expect from anyone who loved their mother My father worked away so my sister and I never had a stable home sometimes we lived with my Nan and Grandfather other times we would stay with my Auntie and then occasionally my other Nan would look after us My mother s mother was a wonderful person I finally allowed myself to open up to someone and she took me in with open arms She was the only person who would tell my father when he was wrong She died when I was To this day seeing my Grandfather cry was the most heart wrenching thing I have ever witnessed I then found a wonderful boyfriend he treated me like I was everything but of course my best friend didn t like sharing my time with someone else and then she left my life too I still miss her It was at this time that I had noticed that my eczema had started to get worse and nothing was curing it I took my skin problem to a doctor and was referred to a dermatologist He was baffled and had no idea what it was tried different tests and treatments but to no avail Since then I have been to various doctors around the UK travelling far and wide to seek treatment My condition got even worse my body was is covered Itchy and sore Later that year my uncle died and then so did my Grandfather I started to think it was all my fault and that maybe I was a curse to my family I tried to commit suicide three times and carved the shit out of my thighs I stopped eating properly because I thought I was enormous I weighed kg My boyfriend could no longer handle me I was erratic and self destructive He left after two years of suffering me It was at this point that I had really decided that life wasn t for me I was in pain all day every day because of my skin I had to leave school after my GCSE s because the pain was unbearable and I could hardly motivate myself to leave my bed I then got diagnosed with a new illness called Myasthenia Gravis for those who don t wish to Google the disease it is simply something which makes your muscles incredibly weak to the point where it is hard to walk eat and sometimes even talk I am now on steroids which is helping but the condition isn t curable I am just hoping that it will go into remission someday On top of all this I had to look after my year old sister since my grandparents were no longer around to do so Huff I am starting to feel like I am writing this for the wrong reasons I feel like I m writing a sob story and that wasn t what I wanted I ll quickly explain what happens after that I decided to get myself better mentally tried so unbelievably hard finally felt like I succeeded got my boyfriend back after a year of trying moved out of my house and into my boyfriend s parents house because my father was verbally abusive and kind of got my social life back on track But here I am now Back where I started Rejected all of my friends again Too afraid to leave the house My boyfriend is wonderful but I feel like he can t give me what I need I sit here every day feeling like there is a massive empty space inside of me I m desperately trying to find something to fill it but there is nothing I want nothing from this life anymore If I knew that I could die tomorrow without hurting my boyfriend or my sister I would do it I would end it I have no one to talk to because I am too afraid of losing my boyfriend again and I don t trust anyone else I am poor as shit because I had to leave school because of my illnesses and couldn t get a job for the same reason The government is also unwilling to help at all I am now kg heavier than I was before because of my medicines and I feel like an elephant I am terribly unsatisfied with the way that I look I have seen a glimpse of happiness and it is totally not worth the effort This sounds incredibly gay I have no idea who I am anymore and I am so scared for my future I just want to curl up into a ball and fade away I have tried to leave out my father in all of this because even thinking of him makes me angry however I will tell you this that man can go to hell for what he has put me through I am not living I m just wasting time TL DR Was depressed then happy ish and now I see no point in living,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood

"Hey, i have made some progress mentally since I started taking antidepressants but somehow I still cannot get over this issue, not with pills, not with therapy.

I just always feel like I am the ugliest, sometimes I think I should not be allowed to go out and I feel bad for the people that have to see me because I am so ugly.

"I suppose I just need a place to vent. The past year has been terrible, horrid. And even with summer rolling through, I feel this utter disgust at myself and who I am; it is no longer a probability that I was going through seasonal affective disorder or whatever it is called. I am at least not as severely depressed, but there really is not a day that goes by where I do not think about killing myself. I just think not many people in my circle, perhaps anyone, is really ready to have that conversation, even those who know of my feelings and thoughts. Of course, people are dealing with their own issues, especially during this pandemic, I just cannot help but feel like I have been going through these episodes of depression for the last five years. Five whole years of contemplating suicide. I am not alone in how I feel, but it never ceases to seem so isolating and that I am truly alone. Even getting a full time job did not make anything better; it dawned on me that this will be the rest of my life--wake up, work, eat, sleep. And everyday what I want to achieve and pursue seems that much farther away. Life cannot just be this, or else what is the point?

I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting poetic justice Is that the right term This is what I mean As far as I know my school s never had a suicide If anyone should kill themselves not that anyone should it should be me It would have the biggest effect if it was me It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn t be SURPRISED I was very severely bullied every day for years by people and about at once The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it I was the most hated person in the year maybe even the school for NO REASON Or at least nothing in my control Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity I have been depressed for about the last years And I have very very few friends and no social life at all Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me I just burst into tears writing this I didn t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for years If I killed myself all those kids would think She really did it and would say WE drove her to this and kids at neighbouring schools would say You know my name who got picked on She committed suicide and A girl from my school killed herself And Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd thinking Oh it s my name so it s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it s nothing and now she s dead Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe definitely reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double Maybe that was my purpose after all Also no one would care if I wasn t there I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout GET OUT LARA NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE in such a sincere way They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there No one really cares about me Or maybe they all care just not enough The only way people would care about me is if I was dead Similarly I ve been thinking what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all forever I don t want to stall too much so that I ve left school when I do it because then the school won t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn t because of them I don t want the wrong people to be blamed I don t know how much longer I can go on It s like a candle is burning and I don t know how much is left of it height but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn t much It wouldn t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I m a failure and a disappointment When there s nothing left but guilt why continue I ve always said that I would kill myself if life got too hard I don t believe in god or an afterlife so it always seemed like the right thing to do My life philosophy has been to enjoy myself and if that s no longer possible what s the point I am everything I don t want to be I m a year old college dropout virgin living in my mom s basement working for my dad buried in debt and getting high everyday I got myself into credit card debt in my time in college and because I m capable of making long term plans but incapable of following them in the short term it s not gotten any better I ve spent the last two years with the active goal of getting out of credit card debt and I m exactly where I was when I started I d be worse off if I hadn t already hit my credit limit I m sure But this isn t about money This is about guilt I have let down everyone I know and love on so many occasions that they have lost faith in me And rightly so I m flakey If I promise to do something I might do it If only my conscience would let me live like that I feel terrible every time I go back on my word every time I so much as suspect that I ve let someone down The only thing that has kept me going till now was the constant deep feeling of guilt Is that any way to live I have no self motivation I can t do anything unless someone s breathing down my neck about it Left to my own devices I get high play video games masturbate and sleep Wake up rinse repeat I let my lizard starve and dehydrate to the point that when I finally tried to give him water he was so weak he drowned in it I got a puppy with my previous roommate and we neglected him until he took off one day and got hit by a car And that was the better fate for him Two weeks ago I skipped an entire week of work I haven t gone to work since Thanksgiving now I m an embarrassment to my dad he wants me to do well he tries to push me but I don t respond I haven t said a word to him since Sunday not even to tell him I won t be coming in Because then I d feel worse and I m a coward I have a sense of responsibility but no willpower so my commitments end in disappointment for all and guilt for myself Somewhere along the line I failed to learn basic human social skills I can t carry a conversation I get scared and can t describe my ideas to anyone I m reading a book you ask me about it I give you a dismissive answer and go back to reading not because I m an asshole but because you scare the shit out of me I m terrified of touching people anything from an attention getting poke to a hug Hell I can t even say people s names because it feels wrong Because of all this it takes a huge amount of effort for me to even be in social situations let alone try to talk to people I end up isolated by choice and hating myself for it So that s what it comes down to I m a selfish loathsome person and I hate myself for it I feel nothing but guilt and self loathing except when I m escaping through drugs and entertainment The only thing stopping me from killing myself now is figuring out the best method and who to leave notes for EDIT I drove around today looking for a good place to jump from but couldn t find one I spent the rest of the day in a weed fueled haze at a friend s house almost entirely quiet drifting in and out of consciousness Then as I was coming home I pulled into a cemetery and spent the next hour holding a knife to my throat and listing the reasons I had to die But obviously I couldn t do it I called my therapist to schedule an appointment as soon as possible Clearly my antidepressant is no longer cutting it I m going to talk to my mom about my attempt tomorrow morning and my dad at work I hope for the best with that Thanks everyone who posted This morning I was sure this was my last day I m not sure how long I ll keep at it but you ve given me the strength to try for a while longer,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I was giving an example of one (about tying yourself too much to your actions, so that when someone asks you to do something, like, “Do you mind putting your cup somewhere else next time?,” you get oddly angry and defensive because it feels like they attacked you personally), and I gave an example of my own. I guess it was too pointed with the tone I used, because my bf accused me of having a specific time in mind that involved him, and became on edge and told me I was getting triggered and needed to take medicine. No matter how many times I told him that I didn’t have a specific instance in mind and that I didn’t mean to sound so pointed, I don’t think he believed me. He just wanted me to hurry up and go have some space so I wouldn’t freak out. 
 
 And it’s like WHY does it have to be that I’m attacking him when I am not?? I’ve had a lot of trouble with it before, and can still struggle now, but I’m trying to be BETTER. Even when I notice I’m getting triggered, I’ll sometimes try to diffuse my emotions/distract myself by showing my bf a funny video I found on tiktok. And does it matter? Of course not! All that matters was that I got triggered in the first place, and that’s a point against me. 
 
 Why does it feel like people WANT me to be the fucking problem sometimes? I swear, I’m trying to get better, but it doesn’t matter to anyone! They’re used to me having a problematic role, and that’s just where I’m supposed to stay. 
 
 If I get triggered, I’m a toxic lunatic. If I tell people that I was able to cope better and not freak out this time, it’s a little “good job,” and then forgetting it ever happened. And that happens with EVERYTHING, not just my BPD. 
 
 I’m largely seen as lazy and irresponsible, and it’s TRUE. I’m a waste of space! But, when I finally accomplish a tiny step forward, it’s fine, but not a big deal, because I should’ve been doing that already.
 
 Why do ANYTHING, then?? Myself and the people around me have gotten too used to how awful I am. We’re all too comfortable. But, I really wanna feel/do better and FEEL SEEN.","Cause of Distress, Mood Tracking, Mental Distress, Progress Update",Miscellaneous

Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is treating to commit suicideI am not sure this is the right sub reddit to post it to I do not know what to do at this stage and I hope this helps somehow Apologies for the long post I had started working at a company where I M met K M We soon were best buddies and after a couple of months he confessed he was gay Now he is not the type of guy you would suspect he is gay In fact he is not out and he tries his best to keep it a secret This is the source of a lot of frustration and stress in his life A thing which most people will attribute to him being a shy person Furthermore hHe has never had a relationship and I am the only guy who knows He has his personal issues why he doesn t want to come out but mostly it is because he is not attracted to the type of guys you see in LGBT parades However I did manage to convince him to seek professional help which he still is continuing on getting Honestly when he first told me about his secret I tried my best to be laid back about it I continued to treat him as I would treat any best friend Admittedly I may have crossed the line occasionally by commenting love you or xx I guess from him end he was interpreting this as being more than just friends However I naively saw nothing wrong in that Thing is he does not believe that my intentions were honest and that I was never interested in him Because of this we have been constantly fighting and it has come to a point were I cannot mention my SO He stopped going out with his friends and I am the only friend he goes out with Whilst I enjoy his company many times it feels like I have to take him out because he is so lonely This is something I had always discouraged but was always helpless in avoiding He is now treating to kill himself because he wants to see me since we are not meeting often He always had suicidal thoughts but he is treating to do it since he has lost all the reason to live for since he does not have me any longer in his life I am mortified because on one hand I wish to help him but on the other hand I know that I AM the problem On one hand I wish to keep him in my life but on the other hand I know that our friendship cannot go any longer like this One thing I failed to mention is that I have never spoke to my SO about this and this is also having serious repercussions on my conscience I feel guilty because I am keeping such a secret from her but on the other hand I cannot break my promise to my friend I honestly do not know what to do Did I do something wrong Any helpful suggestions will be greatly appreciated Thanks TL DR Closet gay colleague at work fell in love with me and is threatening to commit suicide,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"I have had a funny feeling lately. Kind of unusual. Its like I woke up from a nap kind of late after a long day of work.When I awoke it was already dark, and suddenly my dark apartment felt extremely dark. And the Normal solitude I am accustomed to became so intolerable. It almost felt like a panic attack in a way.Yet my heart was not racing. Yet I felt on edge, and so so very alone.I busied myself with some quick chores. Suddenly a friend of mine messaged and I messaged them back quickly. They even called and its like I was so thrilled to talk with them for awhile and the feeling began to fade.I just do not understand it well.I have lived alone for several years nowand I am accustomed to it even prefer it at times.And yet waking up suddenly this evening the feeling of being alone felt like a prison.

Please help me make sense of my reality I don t know why I m writing this post except thatI m really really really in pain and on the verge of giving up I m years old I miss being myself being kind positive and bubbly I feel like the best parts of me are dead I also feel weak and fragile I grew up in a picture perfect family my dad was my best friend My biggest problem was losing weight and having a critical mom My parents had a great marriage my grandparents from my dad s side and from my mom s side were my biggest supporters I moved to a new country because my younger sister had autism spectrum disorder there was nothing in our country to support her so when I was my brother and my sister my mom left her job family and home to move to a developed country for my sister Apparently with therapy she could get better My dad remained back to work and support us abroad Financials this was when dad suddenly made it very big Also dad has a brother his wife my aunt and two children cousin is older than me and cousin is younger than my brother In the past year and a half these things have happened to me and these are the mistakes I made Dad started becoming distant Right after we left his mother conspired to get uncle to join my father s business uncle wasn t doing so well Mother was unhappy said she should just give him money Not have to work together As predicted by my mother and her mother fast forward years and Father is bankrupt with tonnes in the millions in debt that his brother took in his name Dad started a whole new business had everything on paper and handed it to uncle Slowly uncle got in more and more of his friends Father cannot and will not stand up to brother Every time he tries uncle calls his mother who calls my dad and psychologically abuses him SO much that my father gives in Father had to go to jail for a day for all this debt At one point dad was paying tuition for uncle s son while I was taking loans Extended family I grew up with as a result all hate dad now because he s not rich isn t giving them all free money owes them money Dad cheated on my mom this is ultimately what broke me in the years he had been away I watched their perfect beautiful marriage disintegrate Uncle and grandma probably really contributed to this I listened to mother cry on Skype for months like every other day straight What I would give to never have heard the stuff she said She read his text messages to other woman she also talked about her sexual life OMG She doesn t have many friends therapy is frowned upon in our culture so she cried to me And I listened Found out my grandfather dad s dad was a rapist He apparently approached my uncle s wife who then disconnected from my family As a result of which my grandma was so desperate for the two brothers to be working together Mom s mom is alone and struggling because she only had my mom and dad My dad hates her even though she tried to help him due to brainwashing from his own mother And my mother is incapable of being supportive so they have a conflict and I am stuck in between My mom s kidneys are not working like only percent so I ve been trying to convince her to take one of mine The constant implication is if she dies her two kids are my responsibility not her husbands My best friend who I was in love with broke up with his girlfriend And I took care of him We were pseudo dating everyone thought we were together I didn t want to push him because he just broke up RIGHT when my family fell apart he decides he met a girl in the library and loves her and they are dating He loves me but he loves her more because with me he does not feel carnal feelings I came to terms with the fact that I had been sexually assaulted as a child in my grandfather s house by a guy who worked there For years I kept thinking I wasn t pure and would never be enough for a guy A few days after this happened I think I was my grandmother mom s mom asked me if anyone had been near my vagina I said yes I don t know what she did after with this realization and the rejection I felt a lot of need to prove something to sex so I hooked up with guys and had sex with one off the internet He was nice and consensual made me feel good about myself but just dumped me as he got back with his girlfriend I started supporting myself more and more financially and it s been hard But I recognize it s worse for so many people TODAY haven t talked to dad properly in months I think he has PTSD cannot reconcile him and grandparents and uncle s family who loved me and supported me as a child Mom is dependant on me in some ways and its nice and suffocating I feel this weight on my shoulder of responsibility which I plan to take This is all that comes to mind I ve kept going because of good friends and this belief that if I keep working hard I ll get somewhere But recently my sister has been diagnosed with epilepsy and that made me so depressed As a child of immigrants I feel no identity Couldn t hold on to my religion lost all family back home don t fit in there when I go back home now the sexism pains and I feel like an outsider in my country where I ambling now which I feel will never accept me as me Please give me some perspective articles or tangible advice I m struggling so much SO MUCH TLDR Bankruptcy familial estrangement sexual assault sick mother infidelity in family heartbreak Identity crisis as an immigrant and a lot of pressure to take responsibility of siblings I m finding it difficult to keep going,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive

Getting Worse Deteriorating Self WorthWas at the coffee shop several days ago that I go to so I can get out of the house and talked with a girl working at the counter She had heard from one of the other workers that I liked to draw and asked if I could draw I smiled and said yes She asked me if I could paint and I said that I could Nothing fancy of course I told her about how I ve been wanting to go to a place nearby where they have paint supplies to use there but I didn t want to go alone This girl responded with I d love to go I was in shock when I heard this as I m in my early s and have been rejected by girls since I first tried at I ve always been socially awkward and have just gotten more that way over the years from bullying and harassment I told her I was surprised by her response and how the previous girl I asked to go out there thought I was asking for sex and humiliated me in front of everyone in the store She gave a sad aww why and I told her I had no idea She asked when I wanted to go and I told her that my schedule is usually free so whatever time is convenient for her She said she would be happy to go at the first convenient time for her I was actually feeling somewhat happy just knowing I d be able to go out with someone and do something fun I told her she could have my number and just call me whenever she thought was a good time and proceeded to give her my number My anxiety since then has been really high consistently Fast forward a few days and I hadn t received any call or text so when I finally met her at the coffee shop again I asked her if she still wanted to go paint She told me she wrote my number down and misplaced it only to find it in her work attire She sent me a text to confirm the number and I added her to my contacts That girl motivated me to do more art in the coffee shop but my depression and anxiety constantly surround me days would go by until I gave in and tried to lightly bring up the subject of whether she had any idea when would be convenient for her Her response was I ve been really busy I broke down several days later and sent her a text saying that I was feeling really miserable and needed someone to talk to I thought for sure she was going to get irritated with me and finally just stop talking to me Her response was one of the kindest I ve ever had from anyone more so from a girl She offered to sit with me and talk after they closed the shop and she was definitely wanting to go paint with me I sent a few more texts about how miserable I ve felt just being stuck in my head and how I couldn t believe the kindness she was showing me compared to anyone in this life She shared her own experiences and I could actually relate to her At this point I started to fall more in love I guess At the end of the night we sat outside and talked I almost started crying while talking to her because the more she shared the more I could relate until another worker who I think was making fun of me for the previous incident with the other girl pulled up to us on his motorcycle and asked if we wanted to go to the nearby diner and maybe eat something I had to use the restroom so I gave in and said yes jokingly saying that if they have a restroom then sure I try as hard as I can to minimize showing any kind of problems going on with me just to avoid the anger I have from setting off stupid aggressive people We get up and meet at the diner where it s now of us including another worker and suddenly the one on one talk with the girl turned into a fucking group therapy session where the other two blatantly stated they ve never experienced the hardships I ve had to go through and shared their own stories I could see everyone was beginning to get progressively more depressed as I shared I couldn t bring myself to share everything I wanted to with the girl just to connect with her I wanted to so much but there I was locked in my fucking head fighting anger and sadness from overwhelming everyone It was about in the morning when we finally got up the guy on the motorcycle said he would be at the coffee shop to hear the rest of my story We had a small talk outside of the diner and since it was cold the girl was shivering and that one other guy not in a relationship with her opened his arms and held the girl to keep her warm I looked away and stared at the guy on the motorcycle while he talked but I couldn t get that out of my head even as it continued for a minute When I got back to the car I put my head down wanting to just disappear My anger and sadness was overwhelming partly from being unable to have a one on one connection with that girl and her hugging the guy was burned into my mind which brought more shit from my past flooding forward When I got home I sent her a message saying I shouldn t have agreed to that group sitting that it was extremely painful for me The next day when I went to draw at the coffee shop that guy with the motorcycle never showed up I could barely look the girl in the face and I sent more texts about how miserable I felt but there was no response until closer to the end of the day My depression from opening up was getting extremely bad Once again the responses she had were some of the kindest responses I ve ever received When I got home I had more conversation with her and I broke down because of her kind responses and her struggles in life were relatable Her kindness had brought my depression down and done more than any doctors or medications were ever able to I told her you helped me so I m going to help you I offered to help her pay the rent as a thank you for being so damn kind and bring me back from a bad place She refused and told me she was trying not to cry after hearing that and seeing the money At this point was extremely embarrassed standing there around other patrons and some of the other works I didn t think she understood how much she just helped me perhaps saved me so I insisted and she refused again So partly in anger I left the money on the counter of the coffee shop telling her that someone was going to take it if she didn t I was fully intending to do that because her helped meant the world to me and I refused to take it back but she came up to me with the money and told me she hadn t earned it and refused to accept it My response was how she had done more than any doctors or meds had ever done before I finally gave in and took the money back I got to my car and sent her a message that it wasn t fair how I felt useless when she refused my help I felt even more miserable on my way home I think I probably freaked her out after that incident I sent more texts trying to talk to her wanting to just be with someone somewhere NOT STUCK IN MY FUCKING HEAD Either that night or the next I left the house She had stopped responding to my texts Sent multiple texts describing how I had no idea where my life was going I told her I wanted to leave and sit somewhere to watch the sun rise I didn t want to be alone I was fucking tired of constantly being stuck in my head I wanted to tell her that I wanted to be with her more than anything All I could muster was just statements of loneliness What transpired after was me driving in the night until the sun started coming up I took some pictures of the sunrise and sent them to her with the message Even though you didn t accept the money please accept this sunrise as my thank you I was so exhausted for the rest of my trip back home from being awake all night I sent one last message saying I was going to fall asleep and hoped that her day turned out to be great There hadn t been any responses for the past day something she never let drag on and I figured at this point she either got tired of reading my shit or was simply busy as she repeatedly implied when I asked about going to paint Regardless I felt an overwhelming love for this girl and as I fell asleep I actually was able to drift off without too much trouble When I woke up several hours later today there was still no response since the night before I decided to not brood over negative possibilities and just go draw something at the coffee shop and try to relax as best I could with this depression constantly there I got to the coffee shop and the girl was there she asked me if I d gotten some rest which implied that she had read everything I sent Further more she said nothing about the sun rise photos that I sent her All she mentioned was me getting some rest I put so much effort into getting the photos of that sunrise there was a drunk in front of me at one point swerving into oncoming traffic Depression kicked in heavily and I ordered something before sitting down and drawing trying to tune out everything around me The two guys that joined us at the diner were working there today as well Through out the day I could hear the of them laughing and picked out several comments making fun of me I removed the girl from my contacts so she wouldn t have to see any more depressing things from me and I m sure there s not going to be any painting with someone else I felt myself shrinking further and further inwards Smaller smaller smaller nothing just not wanting to be here anymore I wrote in my sketchpad You asked me if I got rest that told me you read the messages I had to piece two and two together that I was talking to myself I removed you from my contacts so you don t have to read my stuff any more I thought the sunrise photos were nice If you care please speak to me in person Show me through your actions I let you in Invite me out ask me to hang out show me you care I want to cry right now but I feel a painful emptiness inside no tears just sadness Tired and sick,"Critical Risk, Mental

"Howdy! I have not posted in this subreddit before so I hope my post meets the submission guidelines. 
 
 I am interested in the topic of mental illness and criminality. Today I read an article about an alleged terrorist who had been under surveillance by the FBI for an extended period. During this time, undercovers posed as love interests and terrorist sympathizers to coax a man who they identified as mentally ill into committing crimes. 
 
 Reference: http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2016/03/text_messages_reveal_undercove.html
 
 I do not defend the actions of people who willfully commit acts of violence, but it seems morally and ethically unsound to identify someone as mentally ill then coax them into criminal acts, especially involving terrorism.

My chronic depression is getting worse This world feels like a nightmare NSFL I m thinking about suicide a lot I want to be dead I once thought that human problems were surmountable but they re not They re just not I only want to live if I can think of a scheme in which humans aren t doomed and I can t I ve tried and I can t and that depresses me Everyone I ve ever loved is going to die I m going to die Everyone works hard for things which they forget about when they die Everyone feels pain There s so much agony in the world So much madness Small animals by the millions are being poured into grinders alive their meat comes flowing out a tube like shit from an anus Young children are beheading people but tiny baby arms are so weak they saw the heads off slowly And then other children listen to music that s merely people screaming Screaming This is a world of endless screaming High school graduations happen and the young men and women without scholarships walk away knowing that they will live lives of struggle which will be harvested as tax dollars for the state no differently than the way human batteries are harvested by the machines of The Matrix The planet is suffering and the minds able to come up with schemes capable of reversing the damage being done are killing themselves The leaders we elect have values not plans or schemes Human history is filled with torture slavery and suffering I hate being human Most of my friends are depressed because I find happiness intolerable pathological happiness in the face of this worlds past present and future seems like a crime to me Every religion secretly prescribes nihilism Humans exploit one another in life because nature has been overridden by the state thanks to human nature And I feel worlds away from it all I don t want to participate in human affairs but go in direction completely opposite to wherever this leads I don t have any hope for humans I just hope That this is all some kind of simulation intended to teach me how not to behave What if evolution made us miserable so we could survive I don t feel like anyone can relate to me I don t feel human I don t understand what I m supposed to do for you I don t understand why as I ve aged I ve become more sensitive and not less The adults who raised me were so stupid that I assumed I would become numb when I grew old but it seems like the complete opposite has happened These feelings Was I programmed to function in a smaller world I drive down the street and it scares me that I have this urge to meet everybody I see but I roll past them like they re nothing And I m nothing too What s the point in being a nothing that feels something And there s no such thing as help People don t help they help themselves by getting jobs One of my only older friends she s really jaded about life she feels like it let her down She told me that I should try not to obsess over these things our world and universe is eating itself that people who do do end up killing themselves I just can t though It s getting harder and harder to wake up in the morning and when I do wake up I ll go back to bed to cover up my disgusting self I will delete this post to cover up my disgusting self but I promise I won t kill myself I feel so torn because I want to like existence but I don t And it s the only existence I know And that hurts even more If only I could go somewhere else,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"So this is my first Reddit post. Whatever that means, I’m just lost and really seeking help. I don’t want to end up like another BPD story where the love of their life walks out. 
 
 I lied to my partner Thursday, I believe I had a BPD episode and he doesn’t. Even if he doesn’t, it’s my fault, I’m no longer taking my meds or going to therapy. 
 
 On Thursday I made up a lie. About my partner’s ex whom he keeps in contact with (but we both keep in contact with our exs- nbd) I said a lot of crazy shit— I received a “text” message from someone who knows her and said they (his ex and him) would ultimately be together in the end, that he is using me, that he wants to be with her, and that he is deleting messages between them to because I have gone through his phone in the past, that I was crazy.
 
 I don’t know why I lied to that extreme, I just know that it was fucked up which is why I’m seeking accountability. 
 
 What does accountability look like for someone with BPD, I know I lied, I know I’m not on my meds I know I am not going to therapy. 
 
 When he confronted me about the lie on Friday I realized I had spilt it was all black and white thinking in my head. He loved and missed his ex and hated and wanted nothing todo with me. As I’m writing this I realize it isn’t the reality of things but I still acted out. And I need to be held accountable for my actions. I don’t want to lose the love of my life. 
 
 After he left the apartment to clear his head I began to cut because I needed to release all my emotions and built up anxiety. As I was looking at the blood fall I knew I had to seek help I didn’t want this to be the last feeling I felt. 
 
 I have my psychiatrist appointment the 19th at 10:30 am — wish me luck 🍀.

recap of my th year of life the worst one Today is my birthday and I tought I would write a post about all the shit that s been going on in my th year of life When I became everything was alright Good points in school lots of friends etc But then in march the corona hit Everyone stuck at home This wasn t too bad yet I could live with this I was bored of it after weeks April my mom came out as bisexual And she had a girlfriend She had been married to my dad for years or something now so this was a heavy hit My dad being very sad and my mom not knowing what to do just kinda didn t live in the same house anymore In the beginning mom would only go to her GF on Friday and Sunday It became more than that And more and more until she easily was over there for an entire week Now this GF was also married but they d been fighting for some time My mom s excuse to go there that much was to keep the fighting to a minimum In June moms GF and her husband divorced and now moms GF didn t have anywhere to sleep so she moved in with us until she bought herself a home This was very heavy on my dad and he would almost never sleep it looked like he cried every time he got up By the end of summer break mom and dad finally divorced and my mom moved in to her own house Moms GF has a house in a far away city since her kids go to school there October We ve been living like this for some time now Every Wednesday we switched the house we were living in My sister was suffering from frequent stomach aches and we went to the doctor with her Many doctors visits echoes and other scans later it turns out she had cancer in her liver But she was curable She almost immediately started chemo A few weeks later we had a bald girl running around the house By January it was decided she could stop chemo and get on the list for a liver donor Living in high stress and anticipation for a call from the hospital we continued Last Thursday we finally got the call By now she has gotten a new liver and is in the ICU The operation went better than expected being done almost hours earlier than expected And now we re here I m thinking of buying a D printer with my birthday money And I m now which means I can buy beer legally now,"Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"So we cut back on my Seroquel and I’ve been doing so much better. Decided we to try propanol for heightened GAD instead.
 
 Last night I decided to take it upon myself to just cut it out altogether. Not sure if it’s just a coincidence or if it’s related but today I’m Uber depressed, very suicidal. I keep ruminating over my behaviors. So much guilt, pain, and feeling like a terrible person. From things like ten years ago but it’s hard to let them go. I write poetry and short form literature to cope. Wanted to share.
 
 I really just want to kill myself today
 
 My stomach is so nauseous
 
 Heightened anxiety
 
 Can’t shake the feeling that I’m a bad person
 
 What if I really don’t care about people
 
 And all I care about is how they make me feel or what they can do for me
 
 That thought is traumatizing
 
 I don’t want to be a manipulator
 
 I don’t want to hurt people or use them for my benefit
 
 What if I can’t ever love and feel real empathy
 
 What if I’ll always be a sad selfish person concerned with my own despair
 
 I don’t even want to tell people how I feel anymore
 
 I’m so sick of saying the same thing and hearing the same shit
 
 A broken record on repeat
 
 I know im annoying, and I don’t want to be a burden
 
 I want to be the reason people smile, to be someones safe haven
 
 But all I ever do is use people
 
 Im haunted by past memories, throwing away friends for male attention
 
 Whoever was a gateway for guys, my drug
 
 Treating people like pawns Just to get my fix
 
 Desperately desiring attention Because it made me feel like whole
 
 I wasn’t a person without someone else
 
 Reminding me of who I was
 
 And sometimes I still feel this way
 Like an addict in relapse
 
 Remind myself I don’t need anyone else
 
 But the emptiness makes me an emotional mess
 
 As long as I have someone to love, to please
 To care for
 
 Or as long as someone else is showering me with the attention and validation I need
 
 Then I’m complete
 
 But without, its like a drought
 
 No idea who I am
 
 Im so sorry, please forgive me

This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved part This has just happened to me today Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go bitch pleeassseee Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger It s not that I plan to kill myself but instantaneously I think in my head I want to kill myself and immediately next thought I would think OMG don t be stupid that s not going to happen That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent The problem here is now I don t really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone What happened today was I bitched to a friend at work via my personal email and their work email I do say friend because I m not venting to them because it s my best friend or anything it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work and isn t very trustworthy as you are about to find out I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment which had bits of people are lying to me again I want to kill myself I feel faint so forth Not the first time I told him that in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I ll self harm if I went outside and he did nothing Literally nothing He read it and didn t even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me I was literally just upstairs Anyways the point of that side story is that this is normal So back to the main story I wrote those emails early in the morning then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep After lunch my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police OK sure Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them The police came What they knew was Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I d self harm suicide and they were worried because I haven t sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive They have mixed in some truths with lies I sent an email true The bit where they make a big deal out of it a lie I had no phone calls or emails from them that day really they could ve contacted me if they wanted to However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it The point is I was fine I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day so the doctors didn t think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could ve done so against my will There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of care or worry who says they are doing things that they are not It s hard to tell most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn t right It s just better to trust your instincts People can let you down or betray your trust I m slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me someone with a history of mental illness seen a psychologist Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment but the police literally can t do anything else it s the doctors who decide Doctors at the hospital aren t going to just blindly listen to that story and going to the hospital doesn t mean that they ll keep you there against your will Why did my work place decide to lie I don t know They could be genuinely worried they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance It really doesn t matter They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves As for my friend I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing I honestly do believe if I died he d shrug it off I ve told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before but getting personal messages like whatsapp not just emails forward off to work Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm want to kill myself wanting them to watch me die wanting him to regret not helping me What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help He did that more than once actually At the same time he s pretending he s a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans He is like a human version of the workplace If I can kill myself I d make sure he gets haunted by it I used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more thinking I could get back at them,"Critical

I can t pretend anymore tl dr my roommate is an asshole who is no longer content with the agreement we made when I moved in with him keeps threatening to ship me back to my abusive mother who I moved in with him to get away from in the first place and instead of telling me something as important as our financial aid got cut off last night when it happened waited until we were fighting this morning to yell it at me and then blame me because of all the stress he s under And it s making me feel like actually killing myself for the first time in over a decade The long version I m clearly not wanted here I told him point blank when I moved in that I have several diagnosis that label me disabled both physically and mentally and I ve applied for disability twice only to be denied and don t have the funds now to try a third time I told him that I cannot work a regular job so unless he was willing to put his social network here to use since I don t have one and help me find something I wouldn t be able to work We made the agreement that I d be a live in maid and I said hell yeah and have been keeping up my end of the deal ever since But in these past months he s clearly grown tired of that He says my disabilities are an excuse for me to be lazy He says I could work if I tried but he hasn t been in my shoes The last retail positions I held led to a repeated mental breakdowns in the middle of the store during my shift for things like a customer yelling at me or a co worker being rude and b so much pain that I literally came home cried myself to sleep woke up enough to shower and eat and then go back to work and rinse repeat The short time I had those jobs I was miserable I led a miserable existence and actually contemplated suicide for the first time since about years earlier when I had actually seriously tried twice in a row On top of that I was pretty much given the diagnosis of hey yeah those mental breakdowns are bad for your mental health they worsen my anxiety and depression and oh that pain in your legs and feet means you re over stretching something and if you keep doing that you might end up in a wheelchair forever so no jobs like that if you care about your health But this is my fault right I m giving out excuses I m lazy I deserve to go back to the mother who verbally mentally and emotionally abused me for over years of my life and who according to at least separate therapists I saw is likely the cause of my anxiety and depression in the first place and whose actions caused me to try to kill myself twice in the past I deserve to go back to her even though she made it plain to me that if my roommate ever saw fit to do that I d be homeless because she would bring me home only to kick me out again because she s not supporting me all my life Or maybe I deserve to go into that bathroom in the room next to me lock the door and run a bath in the tub and try again After all my roommate could move back in with his parents if he didn t have to worry about me since they won t take me in too I wouldn t be holding him back anymore like he says all the time I d be one less expense he has to pay and hell maybe he could even sell my stuff for a decent amount and that d buy him enough time to find a job and all that Just like my mom he d be better off I wasn t dragging him down all the time,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

The worst most meaningless life is still better than no life at all At least you still have the chance to do the things you love Even if it s only eating your favorite cereal in the morning watching that tv show book you love so much over and over again and waiting for the next sequel falling asleep while listening to the rain drawing at am while drinking your favorite tea etc etc I guess what I m trying to say is life is not to be seen as a whole Life is the little moments you love so much you look forward to everyday YOUR little moments MAKE life If someone would ask you what you love about life those little things would probably not even cross your mind because you see them as meaningless But then again what exactly has meaning in life Everything is meaningless Feeling content while doing the things you like doing is at least for me the ultimate form of happiness and meaningfullness And one can only be happy while alive,Miscellaneous,Miscellaneous

I am a make and I am 16 and I just broke up with my gf. When I was little I was touched by a girl in my school and she kept doing it even after I said no. Although I told my close friends what happened they told me I was a loser and that I should have liked it. Sometimes when I go to sleep at night I can still hear there voices telling me I am a loser and my recent relationship did not help. During the relationship I felt like I was more of a therapist than I was her boyfriend and she dumped all of her problems and issues on to me and expected me to be able to make her feel better every time. This made me feel horrible about myself because anytime I did not make her feel better we would have an argument and then he would say she was wrong and apologize. We have had more than 60 arguments over our 6 month relationship. And anytime I would ask my friends if I should break up with her they would say no. But during my last two weeks of school my parents told me I could not call anyone or play games so my grades would stay up. The same friends that told me not to break up with her told her to break up with me for not talking to her. I broke up with her because she wants me to give her 6 hours a day and anytime I ask for time to myself she would see upset. I hate myself right now and I do not know why. I have cut myself multiple times and have to pretend like everything is ok when in reality I am 5 seconds away from breaking down. I do not want to seem emotional because I feel like my friends are just going to tell me I am overreacting and it is not as bad as I am making it. I am scared to tell my parents because I feel like they will see me differently. If anyone could give me some help I would love it or at least some advice on what to do I would love it.

Suicide is not an option for me That s not just a tired saying it s my reality But if it s the only thing I can think about where do I go from here I cross posted from r depression I m sorry if you see this twice I ve been lurking here on my main for a long time and I don t know that I fit in I m sorry if my situation isn t relatable It sounds really stupid I have a great life I know many people are alone but I m not no matter how much I keep trying to be I try to push my friends and family away but I can t I had a pretty traumatic childhood but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazing Suicide is absolutely not an option for me I have too many people who care about me I know I know how this sounds Once my dad and grandma pass away then it s very much on the table friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it However my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy I ve got a couple decades before that becomes a reality Sometimes I resent that and that s the darkest thought I ve ever had I ve never told anyone this before but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad my favorite person in the world is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too and I really don t want to I m also gainfully employed in a job I used to love and really should still love I m not wealthy but I can support myself My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people my boss is a good person I believe in the work and it pays the bills even in my very expensive city I have friends and the ability to have more friends but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people away I just don t know where to go from here I feel like I have to keep it all up working being a normal person or faking it as best as possible I isolate myself a lot I never go out but still my friends are there It s very weird and confusing I don t know how I got so lucky Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them but they re all very cool people they re intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives I don t know how I ve tricked all these people into being my friends or how I ve tricked my job into keeping me employed or how I ve tricked my family into being so supportive But I have and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyone I don t want to be alive anymore Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks Every time I m alone and I m alone a lot all the same But I don t know what to do I feel so fucking trapped But my amazing supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this and they d probably have me committed They d probably try to make me quit my stressful job as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job which is stressful yeah but a mentally healthy person could handle this hell even a slightly more healthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it Then I d have nowhere to go nothing to do My friends and family would get tired of me and I d be in the same situation as so many people who are alone It s like I ve got it backwards I have no reason to be depressed right now but I am cripplingly so But if I tell anyone my life will be turned upside down and I ll have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was I just don t know where to go from here I m sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow And I m sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging I don t understand why I ve gotten so unfairly lucky in life either I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me I know that sounds awful,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"stuck for weeks hello i would like to preface this spiel by explaining what i mean by being stuck two weeks ago i had an episode before a test which i rarely if ever get i originally thought it was a bad panic attack characterized by rls heart palpitations constant perspiration and extreme issues concentrating and even being slightly incoherent the test passed i even got a good grade but the feeling still remained days after i feel it slowly going away 2 weeks after the fact but itâ€™s at a rate that is annoying since it feels like barely anything is helping 
 on the third day of waking up then going to bed extremely anxious and on the verge of a panic attack i went to my general doctor from there they prescribed me 5mg xanax twice daily as needed the alprazolam did not help it just dampened the sense of panic and i still had most of my physical symptoms 
 
 my question to everyone who reads this is â€œwhat do you do to mitigate these annoying side effects and are there any natural remediesâ€
 
 ps iâ€™m on gabapentin 300mg 3x a day propanalol 30mg twice daily guanfacine 3mg er lexapro 30mg and trazadone 50mg all of which did nothing to help with these feelings the past two weeks","Mood Tracking, Mental Distress, Seeking Help",Seeking Help

A Story the quest for love has taken it s tollYou have heard the expression it s better to have loved and loss than never to have loved at all Lies what folk often forget is the psychological and emotional toll that multiple failed relationships has on people each one chips away at your mental health and adds baggage that stays with you for most of your life I have no idea what day it is today but I start each morning with tears flooding my face and a crippling desire to not exist anymore I d like to drop my life story here on the offhand that someone somewhere reads this and can relate with me on some level throwaway for good measure brace yourself for a really long read location UK NO Early life I was lucky enough that my family could afford to place me in a posh private school for pretentious wizards Unfortunately this education was wasted on me as my depression unwillingly began when I was thirteen years old yet I could not comprehend what depression was at this age I was also addicted to the video game world of warcraft WoW Both the cloudyness of being down and the constant thought of when can I get home for my fix left me void of motivation to partake in education University life I had zero social skills due to days I had racked up in WoW but somehow managed to land a girl from a club let s call her X X was half British and half Norwegian she was shy family orientated and equally inexperienced in life We did nothing but watch TV the rest of this chapter is boring let s fast forward UK worklife Through the aid of a lecturer I scored a job working for a top US ISP in a data centre hours north where I lived the city was dirty and work gave me crippling anxiety When you re anxious depressed your judgement is clouded colors are less vivid and all food tastes the same I constantly made elementary mistakes which only made the anxiety and depression worse I never focused in school and the stimulation from gaming destroyed my attention span Four years past and although she never vocalize these words X really wanted to start a family X was also an engineer and quite intelligent We had spontaneous intercourse one night and later I worried it could lead to a pregnancy she reassured me it was impossible on her current cycle I return after a twelve hour night shift to discover a positive pregnancy test prominently left on the bathroom counter I was twenty one years old with no life experience shocked and dismayed did I even love X or did I simply love the security a relationship brings I push for an abortion and she reluctantly agrees I know I m an asshole Things get weird nothing is familiar anymore I m tired of my job hate the dirty city and pose the idea to X that we move to Norway she s fluent I m lost what could go wrong Grand adventure I got a job for another US tech company before leaving UK we travel to Oslo with our possessions and Gandalf the dog and ferry and drive our way across UK up Denmark and across to Norway I did not integrate well mostly my fault and the fact we moved based on a semi ultimatum X is unemployed for months We had been dating six years at this point I had an emerald engagement ring X finally gets a programmer job but cheats on me with the guy twice her age who mentored her I spiral hard new country confused lost heartbroken they speak great English in Norway but I didn t know any Norwegian and this blew my anxiety and depression up I drink for a week straight I got into bitcoin and crypto mining as a hobby before it exploded then I discovered this could be used to buy narcotics off the darkweb Twenty six years old and I d never touched a cigarette or drugs other than alcohol I buy benzodiazepines off the darknet This opened the floodgates as it temporarily cured my issues and my quest was to try the rest V Before online dating turned to shit I met V half Norwegian half American lots of fun I kept up the drug routine and expanded my desk draw with a variety of disassociatives psychadelics depressants and stimulants I wanted to move to California with V as our vacations there were eye opening I got denied after roughly job applications serendipitously I got a targeted email from a renowned tech company doing R amp D work in the video conferencing market dream company and dream job depression and anxiety prevail V and I still had fun but I went crazy and occasionally psychotic I pushed V away and we split and then realised I was back to square X this prompted my first suicide attempt using a litre of sambuca mg diazapam and a gram of mdma in the hopes my organs would cook whilst I was in a benzo sleep state I took the pills and put the bottle to my head I passed out before I could reach for the mdma baggy I woke up in hospital ICU hours later When I woke the first thing I tried to do is strangle myself with the beeping machines power cable staff intervened and I was placed in a psych ward for a while The dream The job was perfect I should be happy I was under qualifyied but these people enjoy the stories and bullshit I spew in interviews Two years pass nothing changes I m lonely abuse takes over Usual life is pointless angle I ve tested all the drugs at this point except opioids I order heroin with the sole intention of permanent overdose No toleranse I snort there entire bag I sink into my bed no further I sank through the ground and down into the earth s crust It felt horrible A part of me didn t want to die just sleep forever I call my Swedish friend and explain the overdose he calls and ambulance Hell I wake up in hospital very psychotic everyone is trying to kill me the walls are caving in and extremely colorful smoke floods the room the tv gives reports of a male rapist and the possible suspect is me I feel the hospital is in on the jig and see them trying to take DNA from me blood in an attempt to frame me for this non existed crime why would Norwegian news be in English One night I escape I run far but I don t know where I am or how to navigate the hospital security track me down and escort me back to my bed The next day a tall in stature ripped private security guard appears at my door Yes Finally protection from the nurses with no faces and the snipers outside that I ve been ducking all week Wrong so so wrong I later found out he was there to stop me escaping and to protect the staff from me I cried in broad daylight when I figured this out Doctors told me they ran MRI s in the extended duration I was unconscious to check for brain activity no dignity left at this point Fast forward back to the psych ward familiar faces Realization I was staying in this country simply for the job yet I was still insanely depressed lonely and no ambition to integrate with the knowledge of the fact that I m here only because of X I met another girl called Y we bonded over drugs unfortunately this is what my life has become she was nice but attraction faded we lived together for six months on and off work was getting more intense I was making more mistakes due to the usual three things Y had a hash smoking habit we smoked a lot but I couldn t handle the pressure anymore and I decide to move back to England Familiar land My tech job and incredible manager let me teleconference work from home for a bit whilst I landed on my feet Problem is I never landed I stayed with my mom for a bit she has bipolar and schizophrenia This is after my parents divorce my dad was an esteemed doctor saw the signs tried his best but couldn t help as she did not believe there was a problem but everyone else is looking at the fucking huge elephant in the room I m talking about the mental health stigma not my mom she s only mildly obese She is money obsessed she divorced my dad for cash She knew I had an engineer job and wanted me to fund renovations on the house she got from the cash split in the divorce I did not oblige and called her irrational over some remarks she made Her response was well atleast I haven t been in as many psych wards as you I got mad and flipped a table in the hall nothing got damaged heated reaction She called the police on me for not paying her lifestyle or making noise Anyway her property her rules the really friendly and pretty cool police obliged and drove me to my dad at a secret location due to being afraid of what my mom is capable of I don t want to go down this road but my father lives a lot of secrecy and I could write a book on the psychology that binds his half of the family together New beginnings I rush and find rented accommodation Things seem good I meet a new girl Z Now Z is incredibly rude but I was attracted to her dark and dirty side Relationship moves fast she drunkenly says I love you multiple times but then forgets it happened at the two week mark I meet her entire family we argued over some trivial things she also lived minutes from my home she broke it off after a pitiful six weeks I make new guy friends and the next months go well However depression kicks in full drive I can t focus function I just want sleep or constant sleep I order a bunch of oxy and heroin and this is attempt four shan t speak of three as it was really dumb I nodded out and awake god knows how many hours later which is really confusing and at the time more depressing I can t even off myself how depressing is that I was out for a very long period of time and developed a blood clot or some issue requiring ultrasounds and blood thinners on my leg The next two months were painful Goodbye Tech last October I just couldn t handle the stress anxiety guilt of underperforming so on and so forth So I yolo resigned and went travelling I went through Japan and I went to one of my best friends who lives in Washington US I had an incredible time my friend in US understands me on all levels but our time came to and end I m back home the past three months have been spent laying in my bed in my room abusing myself with zero ambition to even search for a job whilst burning through my savings These four walls will be the death of me I m in therapy once a week by choice this time and I self medicate because I m not only an armchair

Coyote in a bear trapIn September I attempted to jump a foot bridge after driving six hours to reach a bridge high enough to kill me upon impact over water I wanted to die of internal injuries less of a clean up My partner at the time cheated on me while I was in the hospital recovering and then lied to me even though he was publicly chatting with the person in question and had them plastered on all their social media I hate my state I hate the room I m in I have no room at all They put me on lithium and klonopin and the only thing it did was curb my impulse to commit suicide sleep hours a day and turn my piss orange despite all the water I was drinking I finally started taking testosterone after waiting almost five years instead having to watch my greedy motherfucker of a father die of stage cancer lest I hurt the dead s feelings After a few weeks on testosterone I had a scare in which they gave me the wrong needles retracting ones and I went to the ER with the thought I had a needle lodged into my leg On top of out of state medical bills I also have instate ones and now ones coming in for a needle that was never fucking there My insurance spiked its rates another as a big fuck you happy new year to me Luckily since I left my job after telling my boss I was suicidal and losing hours of paid time off I am now on medicaid whatever it is for young people My therapist and my psychologist don t take it though so I ve stopped taking my medications Mostly because all I fucking do is sleep It smells like absolute shit every time I leave my house and have to travel from point A to B in this god forsaken area the jobs are pathetic with pathetic pay and wouldn t give me any meaning to life except another step closer to a heart attack I feel enormously excluded from my friends ever since my transition started to show more I m not invited out anymore nobody talks to me and everyone says to just reach out but when I do I focus on them and say I m all good I would drug myself heavier and drive back out but my piece of shit car couldn t make it having been in and out of the shop more than four times in less than two months once I was out of the hospital and doing ubereats for shit pay I m filled with hate and despite all the shit I ve overcome from childhood neglect and abuse to watching my father die and not feeling shit or dropping a single tear while I watched or at his wake stalking ex s finally starting my transition I just no longer feel like it s worth it anymore I m taking up oxygen and only making the weight of the world worse Nobody wants me around except for the money I inherited I want to end it but I can t work up the guts to do it I wish there was a simpler method If I went for it again I financially and emotionally could not risk failure I want to become nothing and cease to exist I m tired of this plane I m tired of getting punched in the fucking face every time I try to open a door I m tired of being the outsider the white elephant in the room just because I m trying to be happy All it s doing is making everyone around me feel terrible and walk away despite my attempts to just be happy and encourage them because I m fucking sick of being alone I m alone now and I ve always been alone I don t foresee it changing I just need to get it off my chest because no one else will listen or rather I won t let them listen I don t want to worry them but at the same time I m trying to scream out for someone to come and help me I ve sacrificed so much for others and I ve gotten shit in return So as a coyote stuck in a bear trap do I wait for the hunter to come and kill me get attacked in some new buttfuck way by someone I decide to trust because I m so lonely or do I chew my leg off and bleed to death on my own terms I have no purpose I see no purpose Except for going to school just to probably fail like my father said I would or end up in debt up to where the noose is I hate this world There s wonderful people in it I believe a lot of people are inherently good but I m just a cancer clinging onto it,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"I lost my mom then 45 days later I lost my 12 yr old son. My mom was sickly. she would told me she was tired. In the hospital, she had rallied. We thought she would be coming home. Then she did not make it. My son was extremely grief striken. I realized he was not ok. I sent him to therapy. 3 days later, he was gone. I found him. My only baby. I went to the store and when I got back, I found him. He is everything to me. And, life is not worth living without him. I have to see everyone else's children grow and reach milestones. But, not my child. I die inside more and more each day. 3 months after He left me. I could not take it. I failed and wound up in the psych ward for a month. That was in 2019. I am struggling to keep it together and continue to appear ""ok"". I know my biggest fear is that if I succeed I may never be reunited with him in heaven. But , it is almost worth it to not have to live without him. he is my baby. I also do not want anyone else to feel what I am feeling. But, most days, I just pray God will just be finished with me.

Why is the milk gone Why did you forgot to buy milk Well that s the interesting question See you were going to get some on the way home yesterday but then you remember that you need some bread as well so u went to bread house however the alcohol store was on the way to the bread house So you went there first just because you been doing quite a lot of drinking alone and if by recently you mean last year and the have this new alcohol apple flavor vodka Which was pretty cool and you brought and then forgot to buy milk so really the milk is gone because of vodka but really you only went to buy vodka cuz it s been a cloudy day and you wanted to cheer yourself up a bit and it s only been a cloudy day because of the temperature differential brought on by east moving winds and pressure fluctuations So really the milk is gone because of the weather but the weather is only there because of the atmosphere which formed about billion years ago result of gas escaping from earths interior so the milk is gone because of the earth But the earth is only there because a gas cloud condensed into the sun and the solar system a few billion years ago and all of that came from the Big Bang billion of years before that so really the milk is gone because space and time materialized out of nothing billion years ago So if that the case Did the universe always knew that billion years when it exploded formed into galaxies and stars and they gave rise to planets and planets developed ecosystem single cell life complex organisms humans human society domestication of cows the invention of coffee milk in coffee fridges and finally you that you would eventually run out of milk billion years later Well maybe If You re playing snooker or pool or whatever and you hit a ball at a certain angle and speed and if you have a good enough computer you can say where the ball are going to go right It s all predetermined If you take the same shot times the outcome will be the same times well if the Big Bang happens time over just the way it it did billion years ago would you run out of milk a times billion later And doesn t that mean that you re life is already determined Like day of your birth and death was already predicted the moment came into being and everything has to happen in a certain way just that way just like a pool game No definitely not We ve got free will right I mean just because the universe is made of of atoms bumping into each other that have to act in a certain way based on what happened before and just because your brain is made up of atoms that doesn t mean they have to do the same thing and all are the part of the same system you can still just decided to do stuff right BECAUSE IF NOT THEN WE ARE JUST BALLS IN A COSMIC GAME OF POOL WITH NO FREE WILL AT ALL MEANING WE RE JUST ROBOTS CAUGHT IN A DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM WITH JUST ILLUSION OF CHOICE BUT REALLY HAVING NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER OVER OUR LIFE DELUDING OUR SELF INTO THINKING WE RE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT TO ALL THE OTHER ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT WOULD MEAN YOU VE NEVER MADE A REAL CHOICE AND YOU NEVER WILL AND WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO NEXT IN LIFE ISN T A DECISION AT ALL BUT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE S NO POINT TO EVER DOING ANYTHING EVER AGAIN BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS PREDECIDED AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND LIFE AND LIFE IS COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS AND EMPTY AND FUCK IT FUCK MILK black coffee is fine,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Mood Tracking","Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Everyday is filled with painI really just need someone to listen that I don t know in real life because I m scared of the consequences of bringing this up I will try to not make a wall of text as much as I can but please try to read I ve had a history of anxiety depression and currently am taking lamotrigene and klonopin to manage that I m and entering my senior year of college soon and I am so fucking scared In less than a year I will be graduating college with a terrible gpa can t be better than even if I make straight A s from now because I was in an Engineering program that took me years to figure out that I couldn t handle so it ruined that I became a general studies major in math music and education because I couldn t decide on what exactly my passions are and feel directionless I m going to try to branch out more but I m basically always stressed out because of job opportunities after college and losing all of my friends I ve made over the years as they move on with their lives and find jobs elsewhere This is all important because I had the best friend in the world for quite a few years and a little less than a year ago we decided that we couldn t live without eachother might as well date lots of happy crying and whatnot We fell in love quite quickly and I will say that I was probably in love with her for years seeing as we hung out about every other day A couple of months ago when our old leases ran out we moved in together Everything seemed perfect I found a reason to live my depression cured Mutual love really is the best thing in the world and without it life seems gray Quickly after moving in together she became distant and less affectionate Last monday she spoke about an old ex who she felt ended prematurely and has been texting him regularly and full on cried about how she felt torn She s also depressed and bipolar so it could be a phase but it hurts a lot all the same I can t in a reasonable amount of space convince someone that doesn t know me or her how much I feel for her and how important she is to me but just know that I literally love her more than my own parents She s become much less open about discussing the future and when asked about our relationship she says We ll see where it goes It s all driving me mad life really isn t worth it without love right She brought me the most happiness anyone had ever brought me and now I feel crushed because it s much less reciprocated If she doesn t leave me now she ll leave me when she graduates in less than a year it feels like It hurts so much I live with her I see her posters her room her clothes her food EVERYTHING Everyday I can t just escape it Everything in my home screams at me and tells me to be depressed I can t walk to the refridgerator without seeing something and saying Huh we got that when we were really happy I ll never be happier than that It fucking sucks It doesn t help that she brings up bad stuff and then has been leaving frequently for vacations while I m left to do summer school classes with intense indoor work and struggling with mustering the willpower to continue despite my pain I feel so much pain that I can t sleep at night I wake up in the morning and I feel like I fucked up so hard by falling madly in love with a girl with so many personal issues in the sense that I don t know if it s even her fault Everyday I daydream about ending all of this pain researching different ways that might be painless and entertaining the idea of just getting my klonopin script next month and taking it all with some liquor or something I don t know man I m in the most stressful part of my life and ontop of that I love this girl like no other I ve been in a few relationships before but I just know that life can t possibly get better than that I reached the happiest point of my life with my best friend and girlfriend and continuing on with this amount of pain feels pointless A life without my best friend is not worth living she s the only person I ve ever been able to confide in On top of this I feel like I should admit that the past month or two I have become a mild alcoholic drinking the equivalent of a pack nearly every day I also have started smoking weed about once an hour while awake and benzos do a wonderful job of suppressing the pain I take adderal though so that allows me to do all of this but still get good grades in school somehow I do it all to hide from reality Oh man I m just laughing at how fucked up things are getting so quickly I m sorry if this was a bit long but I appreciate your time,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"
2017 has been such a tough year for me anyway but to lose someone whom I trusted and loved and who had supported me through it all has left me crying for hours,"Mental Distress, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking"
