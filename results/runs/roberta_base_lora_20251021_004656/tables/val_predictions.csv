Girlfriend has tried to commit suicide twice in a monthHi everyone My girlfriend is an absolutely wonderful person with an absolutely horrific past She has gone through things I would not wish on my worst enemy She suffers from severe depression and bipolar Lately she has been feeling very worthless because of her job and not having a degree She was on the right track though she enrolled to go back to school to become a Vet Tech Things seemed like they were getting better But late last month she made her first suicide attempt I rushed her to the ER and she was sent to Inpatient for a few days It seemed to really do her a lot of good They changed her medication and set her up with a counselor Things were going fine for several weeks but yesterday we got back from a really nice vacation and as I was trying to go to bed she was in the other room writing her suicide note and taking about pills I had a bad feeling so I went to check on her and she was really out of it I rushed her to the ER and she will be there for a few days until they can transfer her back to inpatient I just dont know what to do She lives with me because her family is horrible I am her main source of support But I also struggle with anxiety and depression I can barely take care of myself I am also fairly young I have a decent job so I can support us both but it is so tough I want her to get help but I feel that having her at my apartment is not the best for her since I work so much I feel like im tearing myself apart worrying about her all the time And after this last attempt I am going to feel so uneasy leaving her alone anymore I constantly worry I am going to come home one day to find her lifeless,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I m patheticI know this is going to sound overly dramatic but as someone who has considered suicide since they were years old I jump to dramatic conclusions quickly I ve been in college for approximately weeks now and I ve realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage I am compared to everyone else I come from a state in the tri state area and moved to NY manhattan specifically for college living in the dorms Where I m from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity Now I go to an art school because believe me I m not capable of doing anything else I am fucking stupid And yes it s expensive to be here And yes I got a significant amount of financial aid and yes it s still a lot of money When I moved here I didn t come with that much money I ve been very good at limiting what I spend I only spend money on what I absolutely need On top of college being a lot of money everything here is also more costly So money goes quick even if it s only on essentials Started my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat I couldn t afford all of this My class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time I spent hours in that fucking studio class thinking about how I m going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things but I didn t I left empty handed and feeling like shit On top of school materials I am practically wearing the same clothes every week because I have so few I ve resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if I can help it I ve heard a million different things about student loans and all that bullshit and my head still isn t completely wrapped around about what I have to do and where to do it to make my stupid fucking payments Don t really want to think about it right now but I ll do it anyways My parents are helping me out paying for tuition and shit but other than that I m on my own I m not going to kill myself right away but I would love to open my window and jump from stories down onto the sidewalk and die I am so fucking alone here and so fucking pathetic Money doesnt buy happiness but it fucking controls everything that I can t afford Fuck college fuck my painting class and fuck my stupid fucking life I should have never been born,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I know what I want in life but everyone is shitting on me So a few years ago I got into producing and recording music I was stuck in a college degree I have learned to hate not in US so I didn t have to take on huge amounts of debt so I decided to drop out eventhough the likelihood of having a six figure income in the future would have been pretty much amp if I continued Since then I have been doing pretty much nothing but producing recording and engineering music But everyone that knows about this says I should be realistic about what I want and get into a different field I have gotten so obsessed with music that I spent around hours days a week getting better and building a catalog Reality is though that nobody really gives a shit I only know a hand full of people that really listened to my music and they figured that I am not the average joe getting into this because they know how long I have been doing this and seen the extremely fast pace that I am progressing at In fact the first song I have ever written and played for a few friends not telling them at first that it was my own the reaction was OMG you wrote that song You have to become a pro musician after telling them the that I actually wrote it That s how I figured out that I have a talent for songwriting My biggest problem right now is my parents trying to force me into some field I really dont give a damn about I told them that in a few years I will commit suicide if I am not able to establish myself as a full time recording artist producer The more I think about it the more I actually consider following through if I don t make the cut What really fuels all of these thoughts is the nihilistic perspective that I developed I really believe this might be the one and only opportunity to do what you want Who knows what will happen after death My parents say that I am selfish for thinking about suicide and I told them that I never asked to be born and automatically sign a contract to serve everyone else s selfish desires I also know that I don t want any kids so that they don t have to go through the whole process The only circumstance that I would ever consider becoming a parent would be if I actually achieved my dream So I don t have to get at them with that oh sorry nobody told you that you are basically screwed when you are born you don t really have that many choices in life and only a few lucky people get to live their dreams So wo man up Just climb the corporate ladder I don t believe in that mentality Unless you are physically not viable for your dream e g being a model or an NBA player I really do believe in the harder you work the luckier you get I have visited a psychiatrist and the only thing that I got was a prescription for Zoloft which I learned has nasty side effects Basically they are telling me Well do whatever you want just take these pills so that you can accept the reality you were born in eventhough you know that you hate it and are just numbing yourself with these pills I have not taken a single pill and most likely won t ever do it TLDR Dropped out of college no debt and found out what I really want to do in life Already putting in ridiculous work hours into my passion Family and friends are suggesting to go into a different direction because be realistic I set a suicide date in the future if dreams don t work out Got a prescription for Zoloft to basically numb my true self because be realistic,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I m nothing and I won t have anything enjoyable in my life Firstly I m sorry for my bad English but I m not a native speaker So I m years old boy and I ve been planning to commit suicide for couple of months I would probably do it already if not the fact that I doesn t want to hurt my mother and my friend Maybe you re wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that Well I would rather ask Why shouldn t I There is no happiness for me now or in the future I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness so what s the point of living where there is no hope for me to be a happy man I don t know if happiness isn t destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it but does it really matter There s is not a good thing waiting for me period Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing For me happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy It may sound a little bit ironic considering the fact that I have to cope with terrible anxiety general akwardness and introversion Maybe that s the reason why I want to commit suicide happiness for me comes from a thing that I m not able to do I was thinking about becoming an writer That s a way right People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine Well there s the problem I m not good enough to make it work Although I enjoy writing what s the fucking point if it doesn t reach wider public Secondly I know it my sound kind of cheesy but I don t think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend And for me having someone like that is not almost impossible it is just impossible There are various reasons for that I m ugly and overweight I m shy and introvertic I m bad at having conversations I m kind of a weirdo I don t like generic music and stuff etc It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me it s so fucking painful man And it s really not about sex I don t give a fuck about sex I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone It s about love and everything that comes with that For the end I m just gonna say wish me that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I don t know how to dream anymore and I want to give upI don t know what happened but around the time I was something clicked in me Within a day I completely lost my ability to dream about a future I stopped trying in school I lost normal habits showering regularly cleaning my room brushing my teeth and lost all responsibility under the impression I was never going to grow up so there s no use keeping those habits Now I m and I completely fucked myself over I don t have any social skills don t have a job fuck I barely even have teeth anymore because I haven t brushed them in so long half of them are broken or corroded No matter how much I tell myself I want and need to get help I know I ll never be able to push myself to get the help I need Everything became so much worse when last year I ignored a friend who desperately wanted and needed help because I felt too awkward around someone who was just as depressed as I am and they ended up killing themselves which I ve blamed myself for for days straight and now I straight up hate the one person who was there for me through it all All I can do is distract myself from the bad thoughts by watching videos and playing video games I even force myself to take large doses of sleeping pills to the point where I can t even feel my own face because if I m left alone with my thoughts sober I start to convince myself that it isn t worth it anymore I know this is all taking a huge toll on my mother because she s forced to support me through all of this but whenever I consider if I should at least get a job I worry the added pressure will just push me over the edge I don t remember what happened to me when I suddenly changed like that but whatever it was took away my ability to dream took away my drive for living and all my passions and I just wish I could go back in time and prevent it from ever happening,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

In Canada what are the consequences of making a suicide attempt and recovering LONG text sorry This subreddit is very quiet but I don t think my question would be allowed in r AskReddit r AskCanadian subreddit is very quiet too I hope someone knowledgeable can help me Please correct me if I m wrong When you attempt suicide in Canada and police or paramedics are called this event is recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre CPIC database as well as any relevant local police and medical databases From googling I ve found out that consequences include I won t been able to get a firearms license a wise restriction I probably won t be able to travel to https www thestar com news gta canadian woman denied entry to us because of suicide attempt html or through the USA suicide attempts can be recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre database which is somewhat https en wikipedia org wiki Canadian Police Information Centre accessible http www cbc ca news canada windsor canadians mental health info routinely shared with fbi u s customs by the FBI and U S Customs and Border Protection If a person attempts suicide recovers and is able to become mentally healthy and live a normal life what other permanent negative consequences are there Can insurance companies dig up this information Affecting extended private health life or even auto insurance eligibility Will prospective employers be able to find this through background checks Will mental health history be covered in the Canadian Government Security Screening I mean will you be treated like a convicted criminal not allowed to work with confidential information like someone who helps do your taxes or a medical office assistant transport medical supplies like insulin or donated blood or transport hazardous materials like a freight truck driver transporting a load of pool cleaning supplies Security screening focuses on your reliability https en wikipedia org wiki Security clearance Canada I can t find specific mention of mental health but I think that can be considered a significant factor of a person s reliability I also don t know the negative long term consequences of having suicidal thoughts or involuntary hospitalization in my medical record Will this also hurt my ability to get a job or insurance I m afraid to admit to anyone that I ve seriously considered killing myself I don t want to be involuntarily locked up for three months https www legalline ca legal answers involuntary hospital admission of mentally ill people and length of stay or more Years ago I had a psychotherapist who just kept prescribing different drugs which left me feeling extremely detached unable to concentrate on anything and a lot of other side effects like dry mouth I don t want that again I hated those drugs I had a very difficult time finding a psychotherapist who seemed right for me I hesitate to say this but I found some of them very unprofessional one spent all of our sessions asking me technical computer questions and essentially getting paid to pester me as his personal IT support person he was the drug pusher another was working hard on an academic thesis with a really narrow focus which he forcefully tried to apply to all of our therapy sessions whether it made sense or not He would ignore any patient problems or issues if they were not dream related and can also be drawn on paper He adamantly refused to do anything else I couldn t make this up if I tried All of this turned me off of therapy for years Canadian healthcare might be better than in the United States in some ways but there s a lot of flaws and problems too In recent days I had been having increasingly frequent suicidal thoughts but so far it s gone down and I ve been holding steady I managed to find a relative to talk to Not a resolution or even a reliable source of support but it s pulled me back from the edge Also finding this https www camh ca en hospital health information a z mental health and addiction information suicide Pages default aspx web page at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Canada helped It s slender comfort but where the page explains why and Who is at risk and What a re the warning signs it was like a brief warm sunbeam because whoever wrote that web page understood exactly how I feel Thank you for taking the time to read all this I hope someone can answer my questions How screwed am I if there are records of me having attempted suicide or being locked up in a hospital or even admitting that I wanted to die,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Just want to share these past couple days with you allEarly hours Thursday morning my nana attempted suicide She ODed on a mixture of prescription drugs and paracetamol My aunt checked on her a few hours later found her collapsed beside her bed she had been sick and was unconscious Eye bleeding from where she knocked her head on her beside table She had rosary beads and my grandads pocket watch in her hand Two ambulances arrived and took her away There was a carrier bag of empty medicine packets A bit of background My Nan has attempted this before she myself and many other members of my family have suffered varying levels of depression at different times for different reasons My Nan turns this year She was witty active creative and thoughtful She was diagnosed with terminal fibrosis of the lungs months ago and her quality of life declined rapidly more than we had realised The paramedics on a rd attempt managed to revive her and she was put into Critical Intensive Care Since then I ve witnessed the raw shock and emotion from my family members When only weeks ago I had considered suicide again I related to her so much but from a totally different perspective Her chances of survival were next to none primarily because her lungs were too weak but there was also brain damage from the minutes she was unresponsive in the ambulance I don t know why I m writing this out I don t exactly have a point but it s pushed me away from suicide for now I understand Nan truly I do She is still in hospital her lungs expected to give out some time tonight For the brief time she was conscious and able to get some words out to us she apologised As incredible the technology and the teams are that brought my Nan back for a brief amount of time I really believe that if somebody is mentally capable of choosing to end their life especially when faced with a terminal illness we should let them go I would ve done the same There s much more I can talk about more of my nans last words all the differing views of my family some want to cover up the fact there was a suicide attempt but that just adds to the stigma This discussion is necessary Whatever I m tired Self harming still but suicide has been pushed back for another time,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I m only years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long I m only only according to what people say years old and even though I wouldn t say I feel old exactly I m always thinking about our finite youth about ageing and our mortality I can t get it out of my head A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they re and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes as a year old with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes I m inevitably miserable in these pictures I see people I like admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises I m extremely scared of ageing you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me I m scared of regrets I m scared of ending up a nobody I m scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally I can t stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future I feel so much guilt when I m not efficient in what I m doing I feel so bad about myself my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty I hate myself for being too weak I really REALLY want this thing but I m so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can t pull through I want it so much that I want to cry It s more like a necessity than a mere desire The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating but having to do the work exhausts me emotionally I know at least one of the reasons why this happens meaning perhaps there are others but I m too embarrassed to tell anyone let alone publicly The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown with difficulty I partially told her my dream why I want it and why it s so important to me and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful It s not a crime or anything like that but it s something I feel is ridiculous and laughable something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am or have become One of my fears is having to commit suicide in the future between and years from now due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt I know I won t find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don t achieve my dream at least partially or if I don t achieve it in the time period I need to This is because my goal heavily depends on my age and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that My goal is along the lines of enjoy your young years doing things that years olds are Time itself is part of the specifications of my goal year olds or late year olds hanging out with early year olds is weird and unacceptable and I wouldn t feel part of the group either I want to hang out with year olds AS a year old but right now I can t I ve already wasted so much time isolating myself for years in my room with my computer not hanging out with people my age not gaining experiences not making memories but now what I want is something slightly different And being so ambitious or demanding sometimes makes me feel bad too Perhaps I m just a spoiled kid who hasn t grown up yet and learned of life Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable make peace with a life without this delusional grandeur dream of mine and live peacefully where I am I know progress can t be accelerated so much I do know it but I so wish it could you don t know much this pains me Life is so painful ageing is so painful your face changing and getting more year old looking is so painful I want to stay this age forever hang out with people my age all over the world celebrate with them suffer with them talk with them know of their dreams and fears learn about their subcultures be part of the group etc That last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want but yea as you see it s kind of stupid,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

A NoteI ve dealt with depression for at least years now I tried everything I could on my own to feel better eating well working out good sleep schedule etc Nothing worked I was in a type of medical school for a year and dropped out because I hated everything so much I now switched to computer science I definitely enjoy it more and I was hoping things would get better for me but I m still so unhappy It took me years to finally ask for help and see a doctor as I didn t want to worry my parents about it But finally I did a few months ago I saw my doctor and started an anti depressant Lexapro I was so so hopeful that this would help me but unfortunately things only got worse and worse These past months have been the absolute worst months of my life I m failing classes because I missed so many lectures assignments I have no money no job I ve isolated myself so much I just feel like I can t do anything I now feel as if I ve exhausted almost all my options for help and I just don t know what I can do anymore I have no desire to be in this world anymore I feel like I m just not cut out for it and I m okay with that There s so many other people out there my life is so small and meaningless anyway so what s it matter It sadly doesn t seem like it s worth all the trouble anymore And so many people have depression nowadays it s so sad I just fucking hate it here The only thing keeping me around is the pain that I know I will cause my friends and family if I do end things I wish it were acceptable to just make the choice yourself to give up and leave Well if anyone actually read this thanks I ve been really wanting to tell someone close to me how I ve been feeling but I feel like I can t put all this weight on their shoulders And honestly I do believe things could get at least somewhat better if I kept trying But I don t think I even have the desire to do that anymore It doesn t seem worth it I just want out I feel like such a disappointment to everyone and I m so sorry to everyone I ve let down I feel so bad for being such a financial and emotional burden on my parents I m so sorry mom and dad I don t think I can take it much longer,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I just always feel like I am the ugliest, sometimes I think I should not be allowed to go out and I feel bad for the people that have to see me because I am so ugly.

The worst most meaningless life is still better than no life at all At least you still have the chance to do the things you love Even if it s only eating your favorite cereal in the morning watching that tv show book you love so much over and over again and waiting for the next sequel falling asleep while listening to the rain drawing at am while drinking your favorite tea etc etc I guess what I m trying to say is life is not to be seen as a whole Life is the little moments you love so much you look forward to everyday YOUR little moments MAKE life If someone would ask you what you love about life those little things would probably not even cross your mind because you see them as meaningless But then again what exactly has meaning in life Everything is meaningless Feeling content while doing the things you like doing is at least for me the ultimate form of happiness and meaningfullness And one can only be happy while alive,"Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping",Positive Coping

My suicidal thoughts I am typically a person who tends to internalize a lot of my problems and do not usually express when I am feeling depressed or sad However I do want to express these problems and talk about them I know I need help with this because I have obsessed over these thoughts for years now I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it s almost no wonder they do But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy so easy compared to most people s it s pathetic I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn t awful I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I m real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I ll die I just feel so lost I am trying to find a path in life where I am not doomed to suffer the majority of the time and live for those small bits of time where I can do what I please I want to live for what I like all the time but I m afraid that s too greedy too much to ask for the majority of people don t how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence Does it even exist Am I chasing after something that can never be attained And if that s the case how do I endure the suffering Because I feel like I am weaker than the majority I am pathetic when compared to the majority People have endured so much more than I have yet they still have the will to move forward when I am here wallowing in despair over the inevitable suffering I will face in the future One day I fear when I finally face my moment of profound suffering it will give me the willpower to end my life If you have anything to say please do I really want to hear your opinion on my circumstances I have kept these thoughts to myself for too long,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"
tw suicide yea so my recent symptom of depression wa that i thought i wa really really old i m lol there were numerous occasion where i had to convince myself of my actual age because my brain wa certain i m or had to count year from my birthday and repeat to myself over and over that i m i thought most of it wa because i m seeing a lot of successful people on social medium younger than me and because i m not finished with my uni yet because i m repeating a year but during therapy today i realized that beyond those reason i also had this subconscious plan in my head that i will barely make it past 0 like top and then i will be dead i have no idea where it came from i m not suicidal i don t think i ever wa but my brain seems convinced that by the time i m 0 i will develop suicidal thought and then before i will kill myself no wonder i thought i wa so old i have a little more than 0 year before my deadline lol and that s being generous idk why i wrote this i will probably delete this later i just needed to dump this info somewhere i don t want to worry my friend and family,"Critical Risk, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"Two days ago I posted something so cute about hitting 76 days clean and now I’m all fucked up. Idk what happened but my bf (LDR) said that he wanted to shorten my trip length from a week to just a weekend. This changed comes after about a week of him acting really weird, he says he’s got a concussion but he worked and drank too much making it worse. I was ok with that but I wish he told me before when he was acting weird so I knew. 
 
 He wasn’t talking to me or texting me as much as he used to saying he needs to minimize phone time or he just doesn’t use his phone when he’s out or with fam or friends but he’s with them 24/7!! The phone is literally how we communicate and how this relationship works!! I felt abandoned like he just didn’t care bc he refused to compromise, we went from talking ~1-2 hr on the phone each day and like 500???? texts to like ~30 min on the phone and 100 texts a day. 
 
 I really hurt. I felt alone. He has so much time with his friends and family in person and I don’t ever get to see him, and he still wants to shorten our trip that is literally still a week and a half away bc of his concussion when he literally does the same stuff we’d be doing maybe even more when I came up. He says he needs to feel independent but I’m literally 1000 miles away and am just ducking asking for 8% of ur time every day. 
 
 He knew I had BPD from the start but I have genuinely been able to control it better than ever before until tonight. I just feel like he’s making excuses to not talk to me and not let me come up anymore, but why? You know what my mind jumps to… I believe him when he says he had a concussion but I really just feel like he changed into a different person. He went from being the perfect person everyone loved him promising me everything caring and understanding and now he acts like I’m fucking disgusting and he hates me. 
 
 Tonight he promised me that I would have a chance to call and talk to him for a while, but then he called late and said he was tired and needed to go to sleep to rest up instead but then I texted him a little later and he texted back and he had just been chilling with his brother who he sees CONSTANTLY. And then called his friend instead of talking to me after promising me!! He always sees and talks to these people he lives so close to them! He literally just acts like he fucking hates me and I’ve kept it together for a fucking week and a half and I really just wanted to fuckinf see him for enough time.

I can t live with this thought I feel sick During last summer I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people babies that I d never had prior This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD which provided me with a lot of relief In the late evening of Monday rd September after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior I basically watched pornography for around about hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height I d already experienced false memories by this point Anyway for that whole afternoon and night I would go from grinding humping against the bed an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens while watching Porn Hub on my phone to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his year old daughter that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again At this point I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video I shouldn t watch another video afterwards purely because this YouTube video had a baby in it even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone not to mention obviously by content Nevertheless I watched the interview video scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again but with a video loaded Finally I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain s daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn The reason for this is that as best as I can describe seeing her as a baby the pinnacle of innocence exemplified the essential humanity that we all have including the adult performers As a result I felt heavy guilt that I now realize to be misplaced for being what I considered to be anti feminist and an evil person Perhaps I overthink the morality of things I don t know My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff I remember going to the sink afterwards and dry vomiting With regards to the actual first person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video I have no explicit sensory memory of this The image in my head is grainy at best I wouldn t have been able to live with myself were this the opposite After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot I walked through it step by step and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn t done anything wrong and so I left it This as a general worry didn t reappear again till May with the rest of being spent going from day to day worries and false memories I even felt happy and content on New Year s Day this year Surely if I d done this horrible thing I wouldn t have been able to feel anything happy ever again At first I wondered if I did do it and I just repressed it or I didn t and actually it s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety I know that in my heart I didn t do anything wrong as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards and didn t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would ve if I d done anything wrong Things have gotten better mildly My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon I m currently on the fourth day of taking a beta blocker to regulate my heart rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it I m trying to sleep better but sometimes the image creeps in too much I m due to get a new set of the anti depressant mirtazipine soon too But even with that it all feels like too much right now and I m more suicidal than ever about this I don t want to die over an image in my head but is this a belated guilty conscience I feel sick and can t think or sleep I have moments of you know you re being silly start living again but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week I worry that I might out of a morbid curiosity have done it I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it and then as far as I know not doing it,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I ve caused all of my problems yet I can t fix any of them And I m tired of trying When I was I felt so isolated and lonely that I started turning to people on the internet for attention I talked to one guy who convinced me that we were in a real relationship and things happened But because it was all online I convinced myself that there was nothing anyone could do about it so I have kept it a secret for years And it has affected me so badly I ve been thinking about it a lot and it s no coincidence that I have been uncontrollably binge eating the past few days I ve been thinking about it a lot and it s no coincidence that I want to cut a criss cross pattern into my legs I ve been thinking about it a lot and it s no coincidence that I feel like I should take all of the pills I can find and not wake up It shouldn t be affecting me like this it was a long time ago and I agreed to it I knew it was wrong and bad and I went along for months I m partly to blame yet I can t move on And there s no way to fix this It happened years ago I should get over it Instead I m laying here at in the morning thinking of ways to end it all Obviously this is not the only reason It s just the one on my mind right now Another wonderful reason to end it all is that I am in the wrong body That s right buds I m a tranny have fun judging my pathetic life Also I m depressed To be fair most people are But still it just keeps getting worse I ve been waiting years for it to get better even though all of my problems are my own fault I can t fix it and I m pretty sure that I m just too broken So maybe I should just give up,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"
Turbulence before the descentI thought my last post here would be my last one for a while but here I am again I feel so very lonely I haven t heard from my best friend in a long time and I don t know when he s coming home My new friend has been and will continue to be out of reach for some time I ve honestly got no friends at home to speak of My existence is one within a dysfunctional family Every day is a struggle to survive the onslaught of verbal and mental abuse that my sibling deals out to our parent and myself It really wears us down I told myself when I come home from college that I was going to work hard to better myself but that s not been the case I haven t had the drive or willpower to work out and build a better body or study the subjects that I need to master I just feel tired and numb everyday I miss feeling I miss feeling a sense of belonging among others I think I need that to keep going I need appreciation and validation Maybe it s time I look for someone to love I know it s not the best time I d be lying to myself otherwise The best time to look for someone would be when I m stable independent and strong But based on how everything s been going I don t know when I ll get there I might need to just let someone who could love me help I hope I don t make the same mistakes along the way that could bring me to a darker place All I know is that I m worn down Everything I do is so that I can support my family and a future partner As long as I remember what I m fighting for maybe I ll better be able to fight the urge to end the pain of it all But if it gets to be too much I ll save the resources to go out on my own terms I really hope it doesn t get there Sorry for rambling May all of your days be better than the one before lt,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"Hello fellow friends 😄
 
 I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.
 
 There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?
 
 For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 
 
 I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:
 
 ""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""
 
 To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""
 
 So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: ""There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?""","Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Just exhausted of continually feeling this way and it s not bound to get any better The past months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me In the time that s passed I ve experienced the following Experienced the end of my first adult love leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me and even if they did they d just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway Lost the majority of my friends after this and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I ve been reluctant to reach out to them Almost didn t graduate from college but barely got by and found myself neck deep in student loan debt Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another This has gotten to the point where I don t even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use Also generally work graveyard hours but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful frequent headaches Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day to a point where I just don t want to deal with it anymore I m just so tired and I can t see this getting any better The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened but as time passed I started leaning more towards it quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won t have to see them because it always ends the same way with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances I don t have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I ve regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back I did want to further my education but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring I think I m at my breaking point I don t know what to do and I don t want to tolerate this anymore I know I m on the younger end of the spectrum and there s the unknown that s waiting for me or whatever but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once I hate to think of using it as an easy way out but at this point I really just don t want to deal with the pain depression and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Getting to be too muchI gave up on the antidepressants I was taking about half a year ago because they made certain parts of my life dull and numb and at the time I was in a long distance relationship with a girl who was great at understanding my problems and making me feel like she genuinely cared about me About a month or so ago she broke up with me without warning two weeks before we had plans to meet because she had met someone else and she couldn t be with me anymore Obviously this hurt me and left me scrambling and aimless but I ve been doing my best not to let it dominate me and trying to pick myself back up I switched to new antidepressants a week ago because I ve been slipping worse and worse and thinking suicidal thoughts for hours every night at work or home This morning it got so bad I looked up information on my antidepressants in order to find out if I could overdose on them and I ve thought about it four or five times since then I think I m still okay because I haven t tried anything yet and the antidepressants haven t had enough time to do their work but it s scaring me more and more Look I know everyone s got relationship troubles and I know it hurts like hell I know my problems aren t special and I can t pretend they are But I ve struggled my whole life with relationships I m and I haven t been intimate with anyone And every time I get close to someone friend or romantic interest they push me away Every person I ve called a best friend cut contact with me Every romantic interest despite what they would say were not willing to actually be with me I don t know why It became a fear of mine being abandoned by people I cared about and my ex was wonderful to me for many reasons but she alleviated that fear She actually got through my depression and made me feel cared about and I felt really healthy and like I was making progress because of her And then to just be cut off again without warning to have her do to me exactly what I was afraid of happening despite knowing I was afraid of that it s like none of that healthiness and happiness mattered I mean I was suicidal before but now I don t know how much more I can take I still have immediate goals but it s becoming excruciating to get through day after day like this I just want to get over it to not feel like such a fucking failure with people and with myself and focus on other goals for now but I m not letting myself I just want to have someone close to me again I just want to feel like someone cares again Half the reason I m writing this is to just get it out of my system I think it worked because I m crying hahaha but thank you if you took the time to read it Some words of encouragement would mean the world to me but don t feel pressured to say anything Thank you so much,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

There s so many ways I could kill myself right at this very moment I ve never noticed this before and it s really scaring me My mind is absolute chaos right now and I don t know what to do Everything I see has potential to kill me Everything And when I close my eyes it s limitless I m young enough that people would say I have too much to live for I feel so fake whenever I try to start a conversation about my depression because it s probably just hormones or being a teenager and then I end up making some half hearted suicide joke and everyone around me feels uncomfortable It s not like I ve ever been diagnosed or anything I know that so many people self harm I know that all of them have real problems and struggles in their lives I don t There s always food on the table and money in the bank and while I may not have enough money to go to college I definitely am a very privileged person I m just looking around the room right now and it s freaking me out I think I m going to cry To be quite honest I shouldn t I ve been crying a lot lately because I m a really weak person and I don t know how much longer I can do this But I still don t know if I could really commit suicide I m such a fake person I probably just self harm for attention too because even though I haven t told anyone I do it I really want to I would love to just sit and talk and talk and talk for an hour straight about everything I would love to tell my story from start to finish You see I m selfish You see how many times I ve said I I m selfish I think something s wrong with my mind It just keeps twisting and turning I don t think it s supposed to do that I can t focus on anything and this post is getting really out of hand I m sorry I just can t concentrate very much I think this is getting really long and I m can t go back to read over this or edit it right now because I can t think properly I m sorry TL DR This was a completely useless post and I can t make my brain shut up Sorry,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"stuck for weeks hello i would like to preface this spiel by explaining what i mean by being stuck two weeks ago i had an episode before a test which i rarely if ever get i originally thought it was a bad panic attack characterized by rls heart palpitations constant perspiration and extreme issues concentrating and even being slightly incoherent the test passed i even got a good grade but the feeling still remained days after i feel it slowly going away 2 weeks after the fact but itâ€™s at a rate that is annoying since it feels like barely anything is helping 
 on the third day of waking up then going to bed extremely anxious and on the verge of a panic attack i went to my general doctor from there they prescribed me 5mg xanax twice daily as needed the alprazolam did not help it just dampened the sense of panic and i still had most of my physical symptoms 
 
 my question to everyone who reads this is â€œwhat do you do to mitigate these annoying side effects and are there any natural remediesâ€
 
 ps iâ€™m on gabapentin 300mg 3x a day propanalol 30mg twice daily guanfacine 3mg er lexapro 30mg and trazadone 50mg all of which did nothing to help with these feelings the past two weeks","Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I don t know who I am anymoreThat s where I m at right now as I write this I ve been depressed for years now but the depression this time is different stronger I don t really feel down I just feel empty drained of everything that was ever considered me I rarely feel anything anymore or at least I no longer know how or what to feel Things I used to enjoy I can no longer stand or no longer get any pleasure out of I have no motivation to do anything other than sleep and I only do things because I m obligated to My personality is gone as well and the feelings I ve had for those close to me are no longer there When I call my dad or mom I feel nothing I don t feel like myself anymore and I have no idea who I am anymore I just feel like a ghost crudely occupying and controlling a fleshy shell I mean there are times when my legs or my hands don t feel like mine My cognitive ability is completely shot as well and I can barely remember things more than a day s past Just typing this is an ordeal constant spelling mistakes and typos On top of all this I have no one to talk to I have no friends to talk to Sure my Facebook profile says otherwise but I never talk to any of them online let alone IRL I can t even tell my family because I know all they ll do is worry and try to fruitlessly help I mean I sometimes go so long without talking to someone that I will forget how to speak properly even with people I know quite well I wish I had someone I could talk to on a regular basis but I ve realized this will never happen because I always end driving people away for one reason another be it my personality and mannerisms or just because they found something better Some say a therapist or counselor might help but they never have for me The problem is myself I m physically repulsive I ve seen the way people look at me and the way they behave around me I mean who wants to be seen talking to a fat greasy pizza faced creeper stache monster with a sweat problem Even if they can get past that outer shell what they find isn t any better I m a dull person The things that interest me typically don t interest others and vice versa My personality and interests just aren t compatible with most people And even with people that share the same interests I usually end up screwing things up by doing something stupid or something about me drives them away And for those that are close to me I feel like an inconvenience Maybe not so much a burden but just one of those people where others go Oh here comes THAT guy again Quick let s think of a reason not to hang out with him FFS I even feel this way with complete strangers When I m crossing the road buying groceries riding the bus or just simply standing around I just get this sense that people wish I weren t there That if I weren t their day would be better I m also an addict or rather becoming one For years I was addicted to sleeping pills and benzos anything that would knock me out and numb the mental pain Then I was diagnosed with HPPD and I stopped for awhile Then I became addicted to benzos again and I started drinking I managed to kick those for a few months but now I m back at it Every night I find myself drinking or experimenting with some new benzo Anyways I feel like I m rambling a bit I guess if anything could stop me from doing what I m planning on doing it would be if I could have myself back and someone close to talk to I want the old me back the me that had friends and enjoyed things like playing guitar or staying up until am to figure out a bug in some code And I wish I had someone I could talk to about how I feel Because I don t have someone to talk to I just keep things in and never let them out and I think I finally broke whatever was inside of me by doing so Some might say get a therapist but I ve tried in the past and it just doesn t feel genuine enough I need a friend not a therapist Some might also say to call up some old buddies from high school but again I feel like I m such an inconvenience to them Anyways come Wednesday night I have some things I need to take care of on Monday and Tuesday some final preparations I ll finally be done with this It s not that I m in any sort of emotional or psychological pain it s just that I m tired of not feeling tired of feeling like an empty shell Unless a miracle happens between now and then there s no stopping me now I ve gathered my materials and made my preparations I m just putting this here because I felt like I should at least get these things off my chest,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting poetic justice Is that the right term This is what I mean As far as I know my school s never had a suicide If anyone should kill themselves not that anyone should it should be me It would have the biggest effect if it was me It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn t be SURPRISED I was very severely bullied every day for years by people and about at once The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it I was the most hated person in the year maybe even the school for NO REASON Or at least nothing in my control Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity I have been depressed for about the last years And I have very very few friends and no social life at all Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me I just burst into tears writing this I didn t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for years If I killed myself all those kids would think She really did it and would say WE drove her to this and kids at neighbouring schools would say You know my name who got picked on She committed suicide and A girl from my school killed herself And Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd thinking Oh it s my name so it s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it s nothing and now she s dead Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe definitely reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double Maybe that was my purpose after all Also no one would care if I wasn t there I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout GET OUT LARA NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE in such a sincere way They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there No one really cares about me Or maybe they all care just not enough The only way people would care about me is if I was dead Similarly I ve been thinking what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all forever I don t want to stall too much so that I ve left school when I do it because then the school won t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn t because of them I don t want the wrong people to be blamed I don t know how much longer I can go on It s like a candle is burning and I don t know how much is left of it height but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn t much It wouldn t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Coyote in a bear trapIn September I attempted to jump a foot bridge after driving six hours to reach a bridge high enough to kill me upon impact over water I wanted to die of internal injuries less of a clean up My partner at the time cheated on me while I was in the hospital recovering and then lied to me even though he was publicly chatting with the person in question and had them plastered on all their social media I hate my state I hate the room I m in I have no room at all They put me on lithium and klonopin and the only thing it did was curb my impulse to commit suicide sleep hours a day and turn my piss orange despite all the water I was drinking I finally started taking testosterone after waiting almost five years instead having to watch my greedy motherfucker of a father die of stage cancer lest I hurt the dead s feelings After a few weeks on testosterone I had a scare in which they gave me the wrong needles retracting ones and I went to the ER with the thought I had a needle lodged into my leg On top of out of state medical bills I also have instate ones and now ones coming in for a needle that was never fucking there My insurance spiked its rates another as a big fuck you happy new year to me Luckily since I left my job after telling my boss I was suicidal and losing hours of paid time off I am now on medicaid whatever it is for young people My therapist and my psychologist don t take it though so I ve stopped taking my medications Mostly because all I fucking do is sleep It smells like absolute shit every time I leave my house and have to travel from point A to B in this god forsaken area the jobs are pathetic with pathetic pay and wouldn t give me any meaning to life except another step closer to a heart attack I feel enormously excluded from my friends ever since my transition started to show more I m not invited out anymore nobody talks to me and everyone says to just reach out but when I do I focus on them and say I m all good I would drug myself heavier and drive back out but my piece of shit car couldn t make it having been in and out of the shop more than four times in less than two months once I was out of the hospital and doing ubereats for shit pay I m filled with hate and despite all the shit I ve overcome from childhood neglect and abuse to watching my father die and not feeling shit or dropping a single tear while I watched or at his wake stalking ex s finally starting my transition I just no longer feel like it s worth it anymore I m taking up oxygen and only making the weight of the world worse Nobody wants me around except for the money I inherited I want to end it but I can t work up the guts to do it I wish there was a simpler method If I went for it again I financially and emotionally could not risk failure I want to become nothing and cease to exist I m tired of this plane I m tired of getting punched in the fucking face every time I try to open a door I m tired of being the outsider the white elephant in the room just because I m trying to be happy All it s doing is making everyone around me feel terrible and walk away despite my attempts to just be happy and encourage them because I m fucking sick of being alone I m alone now and I ve always been alone I don t foresee it changing I just need to get it off my chest because no one else will listen or rather I won t let them listen I don t want to worry them but at the same time I m trying to scream out for someone to come and help me I ve sacrificed so much for others and I ve gotten shit in return So as a coyote stuck in a bear trap do I wait for the hunter to come and kill me get attacked in some new buttfuck way by someone I decide to trust because I m so lonely or do I chew my leg off and bleed to death on my own terms I have no purpose I see no purpose Except for going to school just to probably fail like my father said I would or end up in debt up to where the noose is I hate this world There s wonderful people in it I believe a lot of people are inherently good but I m just a cancer clinging onto it,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

How do you describe how bad you feel xpost from r getting over itI am AWFUL at putting how I feel into words A lifetime of trying to hide my mental illness from others and distract myself from how terrible I feel has left me with an inability to explain it to others and a skewed idea of what normal is amp nbsp Long story short I was diagnosed with Major Depression and General Anxiety disorder at I m now and was later diagnosed with Chronic Major Depression Recently I was rediagnosed with Cyclothymia like bipolar lite I guess which I had never even heard of My new psychiatrist said that the S S R I s I ve beem taking most of my life are like fighting fire with gasoline Shit I think this could have been avoided if I knew how to identify my symptoms and talk about the specifics of how I feel amp nbsp Anyways the main reason I m asking is because I had to bail on another social thing this weekend because I was having a can t even get out of bed to feed myself kind of day My boyfriend was concerned and a little upset that I didn t go with him He stopped by and could see that I obviously wasn t going to be able to go but assumed I was sick Like not mentally sick but the kind of sick that makes sense to people who haven t had a mental illness amp nbsp When he was asking what was wrong I was at a total loss about how to explain it to him I ve had some really intense suicidal urges lately but I ve chosen not to tell him about that for a number of reasons I ve only told my therapist and psychologist Once someone knows my dark secret it will color how they see me as a person for the rest of our relationship I don t want any of that and I also don t want people to walk on eggshells around me Also I just don t think I have the courage to say Oh I ve just had a nonstop loop of intrusive suicidal thoughts for the past months that has left me beyond exhausted and hanging on to my sanity by a thread out loud amp nbsp However feeling suicidal isn t the only thing I m feeling right now that hurts I just don t know how to explain it in a way that other people will understand or in a way that doesn t make me sound completely nuts amp nbsp When I try to put words to how a rough day with depression cyclothymic whatever the fuck i really have feels it ends up sounding really weird and vague and not something I d want to tell other people who don t get it a k a basically everyone amp nbsp It kind of feels like a constant stream of painful disgust that is welling up in my chest and neck and head The only way I can think of to describe this feeling sorry this is about to sound super weird is like imagining there are worms thousands of them churning inside my chest and throat It s beyond gross it s inside me part of me I can feel them wriggling but there is absolutely nothing I can do about them So I have two choices ignore them the best I can and distract myself somehow by getting high as fuck unconscious or sometimes games or movies will work short term or think about them and completely lose my shit because it s so confusing and horrible amp nbsp If I choose the distraction route everything gets foggy it s basically impossible to think deeply about anything I either get monkey mind and feverishly flit from one superficial thought to the next or get really dissociative and spaced out Everything aches and feels heavy moving feels like trying to walk upstream in a strong fast current I feel ugly and angry and worthless and like a genuinely bad person who needs stay hidden I want everyone to just fuck off and leave me alone because it s impossible to explain how I m feeling while I m feeling this way Not being able to convincingly tell people that I can t handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying just adds another layer of shit to deal with amp nbsp So anyway if you re willing to share I d love to hear how you describe how you feel It can be how you describe it to yourself or your therapist if you have one your friends significant other whoever Don t worry about sounding weird you might end up striking a chord with someone else or coming to a new realization if you re brutally honest I really think being able to put words to how we feel will help us feel less alone and help gain insight into our symptoms amp nbsp TL DR Words are hard especially when you re mentally emotionally whateverly compromised How do you explain how you feel,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

entrence exams I ve graduated with gpa score I ve gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme I ve played in a great band for the first years of my university life had been selpt with women which I had a serious relationship that last years with of them I ve graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies My first ever game had got downloaded by million people during my first job experience This year at th Februrary everything was changed My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy my parents got divorced and they were very verbal to me about this topic I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries totally different industry that I d imagine for my career I dont know I think I ve accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better I could do better if I was living in a different country I could do better if I didn t waste my time on two long serious relationships I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent s offer to pay for it I didn t want to make them pay for MY education I could do better if I didn t have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme I could do better if I didn t stop making music or writing poems and stories I could do better if I didn t take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey Everything I did seems like a failure to me And worst of all I ve gained a lot of weight my self esteem is on the ground I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything Anyways for people around me I am a succesfull mature intellectual functioning person with interesting hobbies But inside of my mind these things just doesn t matter I was so pumped by my parents my friends and my girlfriends nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills social artistic general etc I dont add value to anyone around me Noone needs me Noone craves for my love needs my support needs me around them I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them I can not seem to get laid nowadays if you exclude some of my ex gf s that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life and boy it was great I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions I used to have strong believes about life politics relationships I m an atheist and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible muslim heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire wannabe highly cultural social media slaves plaza workers bigheaded academics who doesn t give a shit about their thesis student women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in I am so sorry people I wish English was my mother tongue but it isn t and I am not confident the way I express myself This life is too complicating too demanding too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey I want to leave here but I don t know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country Here I am an intellectual succesfull computer engineer outside of Turkey I am a fucking roach I ve sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country Noone wants me How do I escape here Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life Would it worth the effort I don t know Death seems like such a sweet release to me I just want to die naturally at this moment in an instant I had enough I had my peak at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it I ve been depressed before even got some medical treatment for it It doesn t feel like being depressed at all It is just there is no meaning in anything at all We are bunch of atoms Dying will just stop all of it I wouldn t care for anyone and anything If I was dead I wouldn t be upset about the fact that I could do much have children and stuff Dead doesn t care Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help","Cause

The thought of the end is the only thing that makes me happy I m not entirely sure what to say I often find myself lost for words but now I need them more than ever I have been depressed for a while now and I have tried oh lord have I tried to get rid of it to make it disappear I no longer think I have the capability to be happy it seems almost impossible I m going to apologize in advance for the inevitable essay but this is my first post and I have a lot of things I need aired I need someone to hear me to listen to me before I explode First of all my mother died when I was she was and died suddenly Obviously there was a lot of heart ache sadness and so on the stuff you would normally expect from anyone who loved their mother My father worked away so my sister and I never had a stable home sometimes we lived with my Nan and Grandfather other times we would stay with my Auntie and then occasionally my other Nan would look after us My mother s mother was a wonderful person I finally allowed myself to open up to someone and she took me in with open arms She was the only person who would tell my father when he was wrong She died when I was To this day seeing my Grandfather cry was the most heart wrenching thing I have ever witnessed I then found a wonderful boyfriend he treated me like I was everything but of course my best friend didn t like sharing my time with someone else and then she left my life too I still miss her It was at this time that I had noticed that my eczema had started to get worse and nothing was curing it I took my skin problem to a doctor and was referred to a dermatologist He was baffled and had no idea what it was tried different tests and treatments but to no avail Since then I have been to various doctors around the UK travelling far and wide to seek treatment My condition got even worse my body was is covered Itchy and sore Later that year my uncle died and then so did my Grandfather I started to think it was all my fault and that maybe I was a curse to my family I tried to commit suicide three times and carved the shit out of my thighs I stopped eating properly because I thought I was enormous I weighed kg My boyfriend could no longer handle me I was erratic and self destructive He left after two years of suffering me It was at this point that I had really decided that life wasn t for me I was in pain all day every day because of my skin I had to leave school after my GCSE s because the pain was unbearable and I could hardly motivate myself to leave my bed I then got diagnosed with a new illness called Myasthenia Gravis for those who don t wish to Google the disease it is simply something which makes your muscles incredibly weak to the point where it is hard to walk eat and sometimes even talk I am now on steroids which is helping but the condition isn t curable I am just hoping that it will go into remission someday On top of all this I had to look after my year old sister since my grandparents were no longer around to do so Huff I am starting to feel like I am writing this for the wrong reasons I feel like I m writing a sob story and that wasn t what I wanted I ll quickly explain what happens after that I decided to get myself better mentally tried so unbelievably hard finally felt like I succeeded got my boyfriend back after a year of trying moved out of my house and into my boyfriend s parents house because my father was verbally abusive and kind of got my social life back on track But here I am now Back where I started Rejected all of my friends again Too afraid to leave the house My boyfriend is wonderful but I feel like he can t give me what I need I sit here every day feeling like there is a massive empty space inside of me I m desperately trying to find something to fill it but there is nothing I want nothing from this life anymore If I knew that I could die tomorrow without hurting my boyfriend or my sister I would do it I would end it I have no one to talk to because I

Male Epileptic and Unemployablenot sure what to really say I just need somewhere i can say this without freaking someone out Im just a failure at life overall i gave it my best and my best just wasnt good enough I come from a crappy little no horse town in Southern WV I was always the smart kid and never really fit in there though Mom was a hippie and everyone thought she was a witch its a very small and backwards place and my having seizures as a child only made that speculation and harassment worse Thought i would go off to college and make something of myself but it didnt really work out that way several years ago I quit school and moved back in with my parents after a long illness they passed away mom then dad just under a year later After that I moved to a city looking to start over and find work but i have Temporal lobe epilepsy making me an unemployable waste looking for a job with epilepsy is completely fucking pointless from wikipedia Stigma alone can make it more difficult for people with epilepsy to find jobs Even if one s seizures are fully controlled by medication or if the condition has been completely cured by surgery many employers are reluctant to hire a person with epilepsy they have a gift for understatement and more importantly In the United States while the Americans with Disabilities Act does not fully protect persons with epilepsy from discrimination in hiring practices the Social Security Administration only considers people with epilepsy disabled and thereby eligible to receive benefits if the condition severely limits one or more major life activities Employment may be hard to find or perform for many people with epilepsy but not all are eligible for government sponsored disability payments so we re not protected by the ADA AND not disabled for purpose of receiving disability benefits how they can say I m too disabled to drive and somehow still not disabled is a farce and although I m not required to disclose not having the licence is an immediate give away and they ALWAYS ask no matter what the law says if I lie about the reason and they find anti seizure drugs in pre employment drug screening which they always do OR I slip up and have one at work they fire me for lying on tha application and if i dont lie I never get hired in the first place and they make up or don t disclose the reason or like the amusement park they give me a letter that no doctor will sign and they KNOW no doctor will sign absolving them of any responsibility I m tired of bullshit like that receptionist at the Dr Geiger s dentist i tried to go to still havent gotten any dental care at all a year later office running me off after he refused to treat me I had money he just refused to treat an epileptic shouldn t have been honest on the any medications part then his nurse said people like me shouldn t be allowed in public around normal people or the horrified looks best case or threats and harassment from strangers if I DARE to have so much as a tic in public I just dont want to be a burden my sisters simply cannot afford to keep me up indefinitely and i hate how im just never going to be able to have a life no wonder the women ive been with have been physically abusive im fucking pathetic if i didnt live in the first world id never have even survived to adulthood hell maybe everyone in mingo who said i was some kind of demonspawn were right i dont even know anymore now i cant even get away in my sleep having awful nightmares about being beaten and humilaited everytime I sleep ive got to end this i dont have another choice I m tired of feeling humiliated depressed and hopeless I m unemployable and in America that apparently means you are unfit to live some people will be thrilled to see me go glad that another useless eater gone and those that are saddened will be better off economically whether they realize it or not i m so sorry i was such a failure i tried just wasnt good enough,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

i dont know know what to doi hate saying this but i don t know what to do i am and in my mind i am thinking wow how pathetic i m of course i m suicidal and seeking attention but i have felt like this since i was a little kid but even worse now my mom always yelled at me about how i m going to grow up to be homeless and a failure all just because i didn t do a simple chore i was always lazy and shit i m so weak why am i complaining when there are other people getting abused and neglected constantly and i m crying all because my dad called me useless and i can never be serious in front of my friends so they ll never believe me if said i want to kill myself all i want is to be happy again my hobby is cooking and usually do that when i m in a good mood i stopped cooking for a month and i would stay in my room locked up and only get a few hours of sleep and then miss school my parents noticed i was being weird but the thing is i don t think they believe i could ever be depressed either that or they just don t know anything about mental illnesses i can t really self diagnose myself but i did stop eating and i didn t want to talk to anyone and i didn t laugh or get angry all my grades in school dropped and that made me feel even more horrible my dad asked me if i was getting bullied but i wasn t and he said that s all he could think of i know they care for me but it s kinda hard to believe that when today my dad yelled at me and it s usually my mom who yells at me but he said you are not an adult and you can t just do whatever the hell you want you keep giving us an attitude and i m sick and tired of it he said a whole lot of other stuff and i know my parents work and shit just to come home to keep my brother and i happy it s just that you can t buy happiness and they keep doing that they buy me whatever to keep me happy but it only makes them mad and i don t want them to just keep giving me shit because i m trying to make it easy for them but then they get mad and call me spoiled and make me feel like shit i want to talk to them but every time i do they just say what because they are old and they can barely hear so i speak louder and then they think i m giving them an attitude and then they mad at me and then i can t really tell them how i feel they refuse to get hearing aids or at least something to help them hear they are always mad and keep disappointing them they are both old fashioned so whatever is happening to me they don t understand i just don t know if can live like this no one can help me i m stuck here thinking i m a failure and i am i want to die every person i talk to tells me it will get better but how can you say that when it just gets worse i even managed to cut myself and it didn t hurt it did but i didn t care i don t know why i cut myself why did i cut myself today i don t know what s wrong with me,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Dark Realizations Planning for the futureFor a long time I have been teetering on the living vs dying debate Obviously I want to live but at some point it stops being worth enduring existing Responsibilities offset this and delay death but when those responsibilities expire I don t see the point of living any longer Yes there are experiences I have yet to have Yes I could have happy days or even contentment but at what cost I don t want to go through life in a medicated stupor in attempt to offset the remnants of an evolutionary advantage I m not interested in self medicating either If I live I want to live in sobriety and awareness I don t see much point in existing unless I m living for the benefit of others Martyrdom seems like a silly reason to go on existing There is always the selfishness argument but at some point there must be a threshold where you ve done enough and clocked in enough time I am definitely not at that point yet but I will be and I know it So when that time comes what reasons do I have to live I can look back on my life and see happiness and regrets I can think about what will become of my survived loved ones and create narratives where they suffer and grieve but that grief won t be about me It will be their own regrets They ll wonder what they could have done differently and what could have pushed me to that point all the while knowing and understanding my struggle They ll regret being self absorbed like we all are and wish they could have done things differently but they can t and neither can I Some may carry it longer than others and I ll do my best to write heartfelt notes of absolution so that they understand that I finally crossed the threshold and that it isn t their fault I ve had practice at that I ve written them on separate occasions but someone s need always overrode my need to die I wish I would have died years ago I m already late I ve already lived too much and too long and brought even more suffering upon myself and those around me Yes there has been happiness I m not denying that but there isn t enough and I have no means to facilitate more happiness in my life I am and have been emotionally destitute for quite some time and I m tired of it The joy I have in my life is illusory and deluded I create narratives where things are different I immerse myself in these narratives to convince myself that I am needed and that the world is better off with me here It isn t So what do I do How do I stop this I am not in any imminent danger but I have a strong sense that it will happen I don t have any dreams left and I want nothing from the future I am not looking forward to anything and every activity of my life is simply passing time until the inevitable end I do not dread this end but I feel the need to test this accepted reality against the harshest of critics Thanks for reading,"Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

A good life isn t meant for everyone some people have to suffer can we live with it Is it worth it Laurel Is what worth it Life is it worth it I don t know what kind of question is that I guess sometimes it can be and sometimes it is not but the times its worth living make it ultimately worth living I don t understand why it hurts sometimes One moment I m okay and then the next I am contemplating being alive It sucks I doesn t make sense that this is the life I got It s crazy how some people have it better than others and don t have to go through the feelings of loneliness not being able to connect with people having family that is only their cause they are your family Knowing that if you weren t related to them they wouldn t care a damn about you Having people not see you as someone that is worth it Being used and thrown away when it s convenient I m not living a life that everyone else is living I ve learned that people will use you to satisfy themselves whether it be family friends or significant others I don t even get to live to the lie of believing that some people will genuinely care about me I know how women are I know how friends are I know how family is Maybe I ve been given shit examples or maybe I ve been given the best ones Cause now I know I know that for some reason I am different whether that be for better or worse I don t know yet as of know it has been for the utter worse I m only At least that is what I say to make myself feel better People say that their teenage years were the best years you get to live carefree do dumb things you get to live Yet I haven t done any of those things I have always felt alone always been the outcast I haven t got to experience life I have just been waking up day by day hoping tomorrow will be different but its not I still wake up hoping that maybe today will be different maybe my life will change today I have been thinking that since I was in middle school and nothing has changed As I ve aged it has only gotten worse My new experiences have turned out to be tragic lessons I went through a severe depression period the third nine weeks my junior year for reasons I still don t understand Is there something wrong with me There must be right Why can I not be oblivious to things why do I always have to face the reality of the situation I can never trick myself into feeling better about a certain situation I always realize exactly what it is that got me there exactly the reasons for why it happened For example I met someone I felt like I connected with her we had a freakishly lot of stuff in common I felt like okay finally I get to have my person to get close to romantically then boom its was over in less than months It went to shit A damn pandemic hit I just lost her Instead of me being able to oh well its life I fully understand why it even happened in the first place I was used I was the rebound she had her friend group trashed by her ex she wasn t even over him she just wanted to forget she just wanted to hope things would go back to what they were with him She never wanted to like me she felt she had to like me Basically went cold turkey on me Am I not worth talking too You don t even care to know if I m alive I never could understand this and I still don t understand this So I ask a question do you even like me Seen but no reply What do I do I m hurting again Except I know what is best for me I know to leave Its what I m best at Severing the link I say I can t do this I really do want someone to at least like me in a relationship What do I get Text Although we are similar The more I got to know you the more I knew we wouldn t last and that s nothing against you Why do I even bother It s not worth it I felt terrible Not because I broke up with her I felt terrible cause is that is how she really felt Could a girl say we are alike but still not even like me How does that make since How is that even possible So many questions and I just wanted answers Yet I was so insignificant I couldn t even garner a response None to my text None to my phone calls Nothing Not even a drop in the water Why even bother Dodged a bullet anyway but maybe it should have hit me I do what I do best I delete her number and hit the forbidden key unfollow That was months ago What s the point anyway What is done is done I was what I was and I am what I am No sense in changing it only finding better ways to cope with what I am Who I am Maybe it was never meant for me to be regular to be like everyone else To experience what everyone else is experiencing Friends Family lovers experiences Maybe it was never meant for me I want to continue writing maybe I should I could write about how my good friend hooked up with another friend girl of mine and hasn t talked to me since I initiate contact every time but its been over a month and he hasn t even wanted to know if I m alive What the point So many questions At why do I have to go through this now Why do I work my ass off to get nothing in return I m in the best shape of my life I have a source of income couple thousand saved I still feel in the same place I feel worse cause I achieved but why am I still in the same place Why am I choosing to live everyday only for tomorrow,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental

Watch Bottom Tier Nozaki Kun I got up at pm today after a heavy night of gaming and decided to check out some of the new seasonal shows One caught my attention Bottom Tier Tomozaki Kun It would be insufficient to say that the show changed my life Being a gamer myself I too looked at life like it was a horrid thing and that the only saving grace of living was gaming But watching the first episode of this show really ignited the gamer in me Thinking of life like an easy to learn difficult to master game really opened my eyes to going outside I haven t left the house for around weeks now but I think today I might step out into the world as a level one player and Ill keep going till I get Grandmaster rank I m This show is truly inspiring and my only show Go watch it Gamers,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Positive Coping"

Correctable mistakes snowballed into something horrible I end up paying for mistakes I ve made or risks I ve taken in my life ten times over I might also seriously have the worst luck ever I ve looked into ending my life but it says in the sidebar we re not allowed to discuss methods so I ll leave it at that It s almost like I m just a normal person trapped in a very very abnormal life By the time I realized what was going on way too much time had passed So I ve started to formulate my exit plan I hope no one will judge me here My father is something I can t even say on here because I m too embarrassed to even say it You can use your imagination though I was severely neglected by mother she didn t even teach me how to read make a bed drive a car ride a bike my dad provided the bare basics and I learned everything else by trial and error or other people s parents As a child she would throw my shoes out the window No one but my dad knew no one would even think to ask about something so bizarre right She was really unstable and would have very public screaming fits on vacations I ve literally never seen anyone act as crazy as her not even the mentally ill homeless people you might run into like she would be on a small rowboat screaming that she wants to die on a lake for thousands of people to hear She s apparently been in this conditon since she was in elementary school but no one got her any help My mother would try to get into car accidents while I was in her car and I don t really feel safe in cars unless I m the one driving anymore She would sneak up behind me while I showered or hide in closets pretend to mishear me when I spoke and instigate hours long screaming fights like clockwork every time I went out with friends While I lived with her she would leave raw meat out on the counter over night maybe in the hopes I might get sick My mother s thought process is actually even scarier than the behavior that I ve briefly described When I have a migraine she will withhold medication for hours If I cough once she ll keep asking me if I m okay If I have a fever she d tell me I m lazy When I m healthy she screams in my face daily that I turned out poorly because she spoiled me too much even though I was so conscious of money that I wore kid s jackets in college to save money lived in a bedroom apartment with roommates have never been on vacation with her since I was even though she goes on vacation twice a year I know it sounds trivial but she literally can t go a day without putting someone down about what college they went to It s actually crazy though it s not snobbery it s like some really weird scary obsession unlike anything I ve ever seen She only sees people through this one label it s like they are not even humans at all She never listened to music read or did much of anything It s compensatory narcissism taken to the next level The only emotions I ve ever seen her express are rage and sadness and a weird flatness She sees people as superheros or peasants For a while she became obsessed with the idea that I wasn t allowed to do more than survive So I had to convince her human beings are meant to do more than survive This barely scratches the surface of my experiences I honestly should not have been born My life is such a nightmare I m not even human in the normal sense of the word My dad is also mentally ill vindictive and violent They are way more than mentally ill and abusive though They re incredibly similar to the weird neighbors in the movie American Beauty but within the disorienting gritty world of American Horror Story Honestly when that series came out I wondered if Ryan Murphy had been stalking me all these years I was a victim of severe gaslighting sexual physical emotional and verbal abuse What makes it such a trap is that they are basically outcasts so everything is totally weird the way they talk they never joke my dad knows like a total of a words they just don t have the social skills even the average person might have even our house was weird the cars they drove were weird But since they were in such reactive denial about it I could never fully come to terms with the truth So I was so brainwashed my own eyes would deceive me You might wonder how in the world I could stay in a situation like that right I think I m pretty submissive by nature and my parents hammered it into me I wasn t allowed want the stable lifestyle my friends had my life has literally been a prison where I took it for granted that I belonged in a completely different world than everyone else and that led me down a really dark path for absolutely no reason I did try to go college at first I had a dissociative disorder my whole life and my mother constantly sabotaged my college education so I could never get away successfully She manipulated me into applying to lower tier schools than I initially qualified for I still trusted her at that point I was so used to being gaslighted that I couldn t even think they were abusive until I had suffered another years with PTSD while trying to have a normal college experience having to put up with weekly screaming matches where I d be told I would never get a job and be exploited whenever I needed any money I had to move in with my mother to save money and escape but she was aware of my intentions and embarked on this terrifying extinction burst She contacted her doctor and tried to get me medicated self diagnosed me with mental illnesses and tried to get her employees to ambush me catch me off guard in the most vulnerable time of my life thousands of miles away from my support network and emotionally abuse me and completely erase my past They told me I had always been a difficult child that I had grown up a loner with no friends and that I needed anger management I was incredibly disoriented and felt like my whole life was being stolen from me I thought I was literally dead for a full year So I had a total breakdown had to try to heal in the midst of this twisted malicious intervention engineered by my mother who is actually the one who has always needed help since she was a child and I ve finally come out of that only to realize that I ve been screwed I don t know what to do My life isn t worth living I wasted so much time I planned on spending healing in order to fight this ridiculous war I totally should have seen coming but I honestly never thought she would take it this far and I m completely worn out I realize now I shouldn t have let it get to me but at the time I wasn t aware of triggers CPTSD narcissism and the way abuse works I was really naive and thought that everything was going to work out that my mother would get help and I might have the family I always wanted I don t need anyone anymore but nothing makes me happy I have no future I should have spent a lifetime focusing on myself instead of my mother She would literally try to interrupt me from studying establishing a social life improving my appearance being liked by other people and somehow find a way to make me feel crushing guilt about this on a minute by minute day by day year by year basis I think there is nothing left in me that can possibly try anymore I ve been crushed too many times and this last disaster with her has really destabilized my life I m so behind and isolated I don t think the people I used to know would even recognize what my life has become,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk,

depressed anxious and overwhelmedHi so this is going to be extremely rambly because I m so anxious depressed I can barely string thoughts together Right now I am in an outpatient program I was inpatient before that and I m terrified I have horrible suicidal thoughts every time I go home but when I m at the program I m fine My new medication is upsetting my stomach even more than how my stomach usually is and I was told to tolerate it for a couple more weeks and see if it will stop They want me to go home for good in a couple weeks and that s even after I bargained for more time My mom is spending tons of money for me to stay in a motel and drive a couple hours back and forth on the off days from home to the program I m beyond anxious and I feel like there s no solution to my problems and I feel like such a burden to my mom and it s driving me crazy I feel like I have no future I m and I don t have a job I m not in school I don t know what I want to go to school for maybe I want to be a therapist maybe that s what I think I SHOULD do because I think my life has no worth if I don t help people I dunno I don t know if I could even handle school I suffer from severe undiagnosed fatigue issues and also some GI issues from taking antibiotics for a year and I could only manage to take one class a semester when I was going I think I should probably go to school away from my family to get out of my shitty area and house and to become more independent and reduce distraction but I have this fear that by leaving my parents I m going to regret leaving and losing that time with them when they die which is very overwhelming aaaaaand lastly I have only one friend who I met through the program but they live hours and hours away from me so I m struggling to accept that too because I already feel attached and I m trying to find reasons to stay in the area afterwards like going to school in the area just so I can be close friends with them and hang out all the time I m really trying not to kill myself right now but I m just drowning in pain and anxiety and fatigue and I can barely get out of bed No one can seem to help me and I just want to die to make it all stop,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"
Tonight for the first time ever I m genuinely wondering if I want to keep goingI m I ve always been a pretty big time loner and since my middle school years have been very prone to bits of depression and despondence But tonight is the first time I ve ever genuinely wondered whether or not I wanted to keep going I ve been trying to sleep for three hours but there s just no way The thoughts are too strong I look at my own life I have a college degree that I can t use in a field I don t enjoy I m stuck bagging groceries and don t actually aspire to do anything more I have no one I d consider a friend My relationship with my family grows more and more distant as I begin to hate myself and withdraw myself more and more I don t see anything to look forward to I look at the world around me What a complete and total fucking mess Pandemic panic climate crises ever worsening political polarization rise in totalitarianism and Draconian policy worldwide I just don t see a single god damn thing to look forward to More and more I ve been projecting my self hatred onto others I view them as being like me Lowlife failures whose lives aren t worth anything I m not deserving of love assistance attention affection or acknowledgement and therefore neither are they And I hate myself a lot Hating everyone else that much is exhausting I could talk to a professional but that s a tough one for me When I was I was struggling in class because I hated myself back then to and wasn t trying so my mom dragged me to a psychiatrist On the spot he diagnosed me with ADD and gave me an Adderall prescription The third time I took it I was rushed to the hospital with a seizure that was caused by the medication This psych s solution was to see if my doctor could prescribe me a downer to go with the Adderall so that didn t happen again So since then my trust in the entire healthcare profession is utterly non existent I actively believe they try to harm their patients for profit Opening up to a therapist won t be easy or productive I don t think I d view it as walking into a room with a live grizzly bear I m just waiting for the harm to come my way So I hate myself a lot don t feel like there s anything going on in the future that s worth looking forward to and I feel just utterly broken I desperately need a break from social media that includes Reddit but unfortunately I hate myself too much to do what s right for me I m not sure I deserve help or that a person like me is worth talking down Maybe this ll pass Who knows But I ve never felt this before I should be in the prime of my life in my mid s But instead all I can bring myself to do is sit in my room alone on my laptop That s it That s what I aspire to I hate myself so much,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I want the sadness to endHello r SuicideWatch So I m a year old high school student who has been contemplating suicide lately For the past years I ve felt depressed almost all of the time I can t pinpoint any external factors in my life that might make me feel this way While I ve never been officially diagnosed with clinical depression or anything both of my parents have so I believe it s not too far fetched at all to say I may be genetically predisposed for it or something Some stretches of time have felt harder than others This past week is one of those times I ve had trouble getting to sleep I ve woken up late or early every day I ve had trouble focusing I don t feel engaged in anything I do I can t get myself to do any school work and I ve cried for at least half an hour every day The worst of it all has been the suicidal thoughts I ve unwillingly visualized myself killing myself in various ways The thoughts are simultaneously terrifying and liberating I don t think I have the nerve to act on them but I worry sometimes I ve been taking medication generic Lexapro every day and meeting with a counselor for an hour every week Both of these have a positive impact for sure but I don t know that they re enough I still feel hopeless sometimes like my life isn t worth living I feel miserable The worst part of it is that I feel like nobody would really notice if I did kill myself I feel like those who would notice wouldn t care all that much My mom gets mad at me when all I can do is mope around the house My dad rarely sees me and never seems to take my depression seriously One of my little brothers seems to despise me at worst and feel neutral towards me at best The other is a real sweet heart but said to me earlier today that nobody loves me That got to me All of my friends except for one have grown really distant from me over the past year The only friend I have who makes me feel wanted and loved by somebody has been out of the country for about months and won t return home for about more I don t know if I can last that long I miss her so much I honestly feel like I want to die right now I want the sadness to stop I can t handle it I feel worthless right now Sorry if it seems like I m just seeking attention but I m hoping getting this off my chest will help Any advice support comments etc are appreciated a lot,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Consideration and thoughtHey Reddit I don t know how to really start this for my first post but hopefully you will bear with me and I hopefully at some point I ll be able to share my thoughts and feelings and people can empathize with me I m pretty much going to be throwing out my thoughts and I may sound strange at times so please forgive me if that happens I am suicidal It s not a continuous thing where I think about it non stop but I do get the thoughts often Some might look at me and think that I d have a pretty decent life and that there s nothing wrong with it I have friends who love me a family that cares about me sometimes and I guess I couldn t really pinpoint why I am suicidal I have been to the doctor for help after years of self diagnosis with depression I was not in the state of being too proud to ask for help but I was worried about being criticized by my family members I d often think about suicide and ways I could do it My main thought processes are Hanging myself I can t tie knots so this isn t really viable for me Drowning I have a morbid fear of water Jumping from a great height I also have a fear of heights I have never talked to anyone about this before apart from my doctor It took me a LOT of courage to visit the doctor Like I said earlier it took me about years to actually ask for help I think the main problem for me if you can call it a problem is that I d want to commit suicide but I can t find it in me to take my own life People might think it s a good thing that I m still here but for me it is an never ending battle with myself Whenever I have these thoughts I also think of how people would react to me successfully committing suicide I can imagine that they would feel bad obviously I think it s another reason why I can t do it I can give a lot to my friends and I am a rather selfless person I love my friends more than I love myself and I would do anything to make the ones I love happy I d walk on hot coals or broken glass or I d run into moving traffic just so my friend would smile They definitely wouldn t smile if I ran into traffic and died but this is my problem I suppose I don t want to be here but there are a few things in the way The doctor put me on a month waiting lost for a counselor and I ve been prescribed anti depressants My mother doesn t want me to take them because she believes that I will become dependant on them and she thinks I will turn out like a zombie I also asked one of my uncles and he described depression as a difficult thing He said it s all about training your mind to be positive For me that is very difficult and I didn t even think of bringing suicide up to him In honesty I don t think it s fair to tell anyone that I m suicidal I m only here writing this in the hope that I will find some relief Maybe I will I think the one true relief for me is suicide When I went for help my family members reacted negatively There was no praise in finding help which is understandable seeing as most of the time family members do not understand depression and suicide etc Friends might but in my eyes family doesn t My brother said I was lying to the doctor about how I feel which isn t true If I was crying and sighing non stop and I breathed deeply left the house and went to the doctor for what I thought was an emergency I needed the help While I wouldn t say I truly recieved help it was a weight that was lifted to find that my illness was recognised I was diagnosed with major depression anxiety and seasonal affective disorder at the start of this month I guess I really don t have a point to this because I m not really asking for help directly but it is a little better for me knowing I can speak to a wider audience about how I feel Suicidal thoughts for me are still ongoing everyday I am very very scared though as to if I ll go through with it Thank you for reading if you have I appreciate it,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"Lately, I’ve been very depressed, and my BPD has been the worst it has in a while. I feel like 99% of the time I’m dissociating, or smoking weed, which doesn’t even help me anymore because I’ve developed such a high tolerance. I feel like I’ve been a jerk to my girlfriend, who is also my FP. I’ve been a jerk to my friends too. I barely speak anymore. I barely do anything. I just dissociate all day and stare blankly. But I also fly off the handle easily. The smallest thing will make me irrationally upset or angry, and it’s really hard for me to control it. I know I’ve been horrible and toxic, and the shame I feel for all my actions seems to weigh me even deeper. The more toxic I get, the more ashamed and filled with self hatred I become, and the more I hate myself, the more angry and emotionally erratic I get. I don’t know what to do. I’m on anti depressants, and I feel like they worked really well for me at first, but now they don’t work very well at all and I’m right where I was before I was hospitalized a few months ago.

"I have a friend who wears his diseases on his sleeve. He'll bring it up any chance he gets. However, all the diseases are easy to get diagnosed for: ADD, Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar (some other stuff I can't remember now). I think he even tried to diagnose himself with autism. At first, I just accepted it, but then he just won't shut up about them. Not just with me, but with complete strangers. It was like he viewed it as some sort of badge.
 
 Not to mention that he would always go through a cycle with his diseases: research, self diagnosis, confirmation from friends (by listing out the symptoms of his desired disease and saying he has them), then comfirmation by a doctor (by listing out the symptoms of his desired disease and saying he has them).
 
 You'd think having a mental disorder is a private matter. My mother had depression for my whole life and I never knew until I found the depression pills she hides.
 
 Anyways, this isn't about my friend really. I'm giving him the support he needs (even though it embarrasses me every time he brags about them). Instead, this is about factitious disorder and you. Do you have real mental diseases or factitious disorder? Read all about it below:

 so i have very bad health anxiety since the february similar problems years ago but thats another story probably due to stress since im moving in another country for work next month stress gives me tension headaches and that leads to me thinking i have brain cancer and whatnot
 
 however since march im in a small startup until end of next month for the next funding round we got a business trip this week one of our ceos couldnt attend since shes busy otherwise therefore i am the only option left to go with our other ceo and also a friend of mine since 3 years the organizer specifcally required two people and one is not enough for whatever reason 
 
 i was really stressing out about this since small meeting directly put me into fight or flight lately last week i made a spontaneous visit at a psychiatrist who describwd me 150mg bupropione he told me side effects are not very relevant and i should start right away rather than wait for the business trip to be over the medication relieved my depression but anxiety is unchanged and i wake up at night with panic 
 
 like this i really just dont want to go on a business trip but canceling everything would mean that my colleague has to go alone 
 
 i cant decide what to do disappoint my colleagues and cringe because i have to tell them about my mental health issues or suffer really hard for a few days hoping i get no major panic attacks

So why continue Ever since middle school I have wanted to commit suicide It s not gotten better I am in my final stretch of school at college I just want to end it My logic has shifted from I hate myself because I am an awful person who doesn t deserve to live to what s the point of living I figured it out I am just like everyone else We all have problems and we all have things we are good at and bad at That s fine There s no reason why I should hate myself But I do Every action I take causes me more sadness then happiness And the happiness I do attain never lasts more than a few days I ve tried medication and it makes everything worse Much worse What s the point of continuing on if the moments of happiness in life are drowned out by the sadness I feel of every day life I come into the world alone I go out alone I have a loving family amp caring friends I ve a bright future and I have almost a hundred grand to my name without so much as raising a finger to attain it I can t enjoy any of that Instead I focus on the fact that I can t enjoy it I focus on everything I do that s wrong regrettable past actions and why must I be hurtful towards anything I care about even if it s in jest I can be one of the nicest people and that s fine In fact I like making people happy because since I can t enjoy being happy at least I can window shop and watch your happiness What s the point of carrying on though It s as if everything I eat turns to ash The only reason I ve not killed myself just yet is because it s selfish and hurtful towards the people I care about I had a fairly disturbing thought process recently You always go out of your way for others Do something for yourself something you ve wanted since middle school Kill yourself I realize now that my preferred method for selfinflicted death is gunshot to the head Anything else would give me too much of a hesitation I have plenty to live for I don t want too I spend too much effort trying to accomplish my goals for things could make me happy I m tired of trying to be happy and failing constantly I can t make a moment of happiness last when I have an ocean of painful things to remember or harp on Even if it s not from that ocean I can look at other perspectives of my life and be disappointed in myself Ignoring the introspective causes of depression in my life another source is the complete meaningless of my life I work semi hard to attain certain goals and values and once completed the joy is rather limited but still existent However I am tired I am tired of work at the age of The rest of my life will be filled with nothing but work till I retire Wake up work sleep Repeat Why That s such a mind numbing task to endure for the rest of my for see able future It s definitely not something to look forward too I don t want to be alive if I am going to be forced to work for the rest of my life Fun fact I ve been commited to the hospital for self harm in fifth grade and have attempted suicide four times my last attempt being senior of highschool I used to cut myself I ve been put on antidepressants three times all with no real effect I was offered to moderate this place a while back I said no because this was gonna be hard to tell other people you should be alive when I didn t want to Of course the reason I gave MWM for my decline was that this place was far too depressing TL DR The emotions caused by the negatives of life outweigh the emotions by the positive So why carry on I want to stop putting effort into being alive It s far too much work and appears to have little to no pay off,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Pushed to the edge and trying to find hopeI haven t made a post like this before but have reached out in the past with career guidance and the such Right now I m not doing well and I m in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that won t scare and worry my friends and family I ve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last years of depression and anxiety now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis one month ago My post isn t a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around My now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night Now Some of my best friends got married this week where my ex was the maid of honor I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day many advise no on the friends with the ex especially in this situation but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner and just want my friendship that I have had with her to remain I don t have many friends left around me The night before their wedding I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didn t say much more than that My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi Polar disorder They don t understand it and Don t believe I am and think I m chasing something that doesn t exists The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to But I wasn t able to I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do And told her I don t think being friends will ever work I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding My friends and fraternity brothers All this is too much for me right now with the added fact I ve changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I don t find meaningful or fulfilling And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole I know now that it s a problem I need to work on I ve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little I don t know how they feel but I can imagine it hurts is frustrating and an annoyance they didn t need I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself That it would magnify the pain I m feeling and put it on to them I m just so unstable right now even on medication therapy and exercise I know I can reach out to my friends for support and don t want to burden them I m just so afraid and lonely right now I don t want to die but death is looking more and more favorable I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away To anyone that reads this thank you,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

What to do next I m years old I just graduated high school in the spring I have struggled with depression on and off since But since spring of my life has been in a downward spiral August I moved out of my parents house two days before the start of my senior year of high school I spent all of that school year commuting hr plus to school all the while working full time to pay for somewhere I could live My grades suffered and when the time to apply to colleges came around I was left with one place that would take me and it was the school I least wanted to attend I sucked it up the rest of the school year and enrolled in summer courses at said college but I never attended a single class I just took advantage of the free counseling for students The psychologist there diagnosed me with borderline personality and major depressive disorder I came clean about the diagnosis to my parents and asked for their help I deferred my fall admission to the winter to take some time off and get right but just this morning my parents with two police officers at their sides kicked me out based on fear that I was going to be violent I have little money left because I spent it to enroll in summer classes no job no car and no place to go I tried to hang myself earlier today but I couldn t bring myself to fully commit,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"Is it overcompensating because you feel unworthy, so you need to give others an added value, because you aren't one ?
 Is it you picking narcissistic people so that they feed of you, since it's familiar?
 Is it out of kindness and empathy?
 Is it out of guilt?
 Were you trying to save yourself through them?
 Why the self sacrifice?
 Why doing so and not being at all happy about it, even angry at yourself?
 Why those people disappear once you stuck on their side when they were in distress? Or was it you pushing them away, because you feel that now that you aren't needed you will be discarded? Or them changing their attitude? Are you the jerk at the end ? Or is it them ?
 And why does it feel good, so good when you weren't the one that messed it up, after asking most of the people you know, if you did? And why can't you get over it, ever, when you did?
 
 I've never had a ""sure"" answer for those questions, I don't trust my judgement, and maybe I'm just victimising myself, or maybe I'm not.
 
 Had been dealing with those interactions most of my life, I wanna break the cycle. 
 I try avoiding people that love bomb, friends that show up when things go wrong and disappear when life is nice again.

Apathetic towards life Basically I m going through an intense existential crisis Can t sleep because I m thinking constantly about the meaningless and futility of human existence and the fact that nothing that humans treasure in this world actually means anything to me and that I would be equally as fulfilled spending the rest of my life in a small room living on bowls of rice as I would living the mundane life of the average American forming superficial relationships with other and climbing the corporate ladder until I either save up enough money to retire and play bingo with other dying people buy a beachfront property like one of those snooty rich white people you see on HGTV or be like the average american and work until I meet my inevitable death Even if I become a doctor the lives I save are going to end anyway Even if I become a politician whatever country I try to save is going to crumble eventually anyway Even if I become a writer my words will be lost someday and one day every trace of humanity s existence will be wiped out and forgotten Literally the only thing I can think of that I would dream of doing would be to travel the world and see as much of it as I can but even the excitement of that is being stamped out by the constant overflowing of information on the internet about the world Why save a shit ton of money to travel to Japan when you could go online and look at pictures read travel blogs listen to their music on youtube do a bunch of other stuff that effectively would ruin the excitement of your life experience There are so many people better of than you that you can just live vicariously through and even if you don t frequent the internet very often you re still bound to at some point feel like you re experiencing some form of sensory overload with the media constantly in you face all the goddamn time Everything just feels like it s already been said and done and I m pretty honestly bored with life,"Positive Coping, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Positive Coping, Seeking Help"

"Abilify (Aripiprazole) has shown some clinical effectiveness in treating borderline personality disorder.
 
 And let me just say, these magic little tic tacs have made a world of difference for me, when combined with therapy and my antidepressant. A year ago, my romantic relationship was particularly triggering, and I was prone to episodes of rage and self harm. I felt horribly inadequate, alien and at a constant risk of being abandoned.
 
 Nowadays, my moods are steadier, without any sense of being ""zombified."" It feels like I have a chance to practice some self-soothing exercises when I'm feeling triggered, as opposed to suddenly flying into blinding, red-hot fury or a suicidal spiral of desperate sadness. My self perception is also a lot more rational- I still see my faults, but they don't seem world-ending, anymore. The people around me seem more accepting, trustworthy and empathetic. 
 
 Even if they're not prescribed Abilify, I highly recommend that anyone who is feeling ""stuck"" in their current treatment speaks to their psychiatrist about treatment options. I had to specifically ask about them, months after my diagnosis, to start the conversation.
